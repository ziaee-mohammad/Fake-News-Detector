Text: Three suspects are still at large after 12 people were injured in a shooting at a pub in Toronto, police in the Canadian city say.
The shooting took place at 22:39 on Friday local time (03:39 GMT Saturday) near Scarborough city centre in eastern Toronto.
Authorities said six people suffered bullet wounds and others were hurt by flying or broken glass. The injuries were not life-threatening, they said.
Toronto police said the three men, armed with an assault rifle and handguns, had entered the pub and "opened fire indiscriminately".
A motive "right now remains unclear and we're chasing down all leads", said Police Supt Paul MacIntyre.
"This was a brazen and reckless act of violence that's really shaken our community and the city itself," he added.
Police said they were deploying all available resources to find the suspects.
Earlier, they said that one suspect, wearing a black balaclava, had been seen fleeing the scene in a silver car.
The victims ranged in age from 20s to mid-50, according to police.
"I'm happy to report, by the grace of God, that there have been no fatalities," Supt MacIntyre said, which he called "extremely lucky."
He said he and other officers were "horrified" by video of the shooting.
"These guys just looked at the crowd and opened fire. It was horrible."
Glass walls were shattered and there was "blood all over the floor", including in the basement, where some people ran to hide before police arrived, he said.
Mayor Olivia Chow expressed deep concern over the mass shooting, telling reporters on Saturday that she was "deeply troubled" by the incident.
"It is troubling because of the magnitude of the shooting and the number of people hurt," Mayor Chow said.
She said that police have been actively investigating the case throughout the night and into the morning.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford also condemned the violence, stating in an X post on Saturday that he fully supports the Toronto Police Service in their search for the suspects.
The number of those injured in this incident is high compared to other shootings in the area in 2024.
Last year, eight people were injured and two killed in shootings and firearm discharges in the police division where Friday's incident occurred, the department's data shows.
In Toronto, which has a three million population, 43 people were killed in shootings last year.
Canada has a lower rate of firearm homicides than its neighbour the US, with 0.6 per 100,000 people compared to 4.5 per 100,000, according to 2021 data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

Headline: What is hantavirus, disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife?

Text: Betsy Arakawa, wife of Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, died from a respiratory illness linked to hantavirus, a rare disease transmitted by infected rodents, officials have confirmed.
Health experts warn that hantavirus can cause flu-like symptoms after exposure to rodent droppings, and in severe cases, it may develop into Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), a life-threatening lung condition.
Medical investigators believe Ms Arakawa contracted HPS, which led to her death.
It is believed she died a week before her husband, who was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Authorities discovered the deceased couple in their New Mexico home last month.
Here's what you need to know about hantavirus.
Hantavirus refers to a strain of viruses carried by rodents, primarily transmitted to humans through inhalation of airborne particles from dried rodent droppings.
Infections typically occur when the virus becomes airborne from a rodent's urine, droppings, or saliva, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Though rare, it can also spread through rodent bites or scratches. In North America, deer mice are the most common carriers, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The virus can cause two severe illnesses. The first, Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome - the most common strain in the US - was the illness that led to Ms Arakawa's death, officials say.
Symptoms often start with fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, followed by headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal issues. If respiratory symptoms develop, the mortality rate is approximately 38%, according to the CDC.
The second illness, Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal syndrome, is more severe and primarily affects the kidneys.
The CDC reported 864 cases of hantavirus in the US between 1993 and 2022.
Most of the cases were found in rural areas of western states like California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.
The agency began surveillance for hantavirus diseases in 1993 during an outbreak of severe respiratory illness near the Four Corners region of the US where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah all meet.
There may be around 150,000 cases of Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal syndrome worldwide each year, according to a report from the National Institutes of Health. More than half occur in China.
There is no specific treatment for hantavirus infections.
The CDC recommends supportive care to treat symptoms.
Patients with severe symptoms may need to be admitted to hospitals in intensive care units. Some may need to be intubated in severe cases.
The CDC recommends eliminating contact with rodents in homes or workplaces to reduce exposure to the virus.
The agency also recommends sealing entry points in basements or attics where rodents may enter homes.
Wearing protective gear is also suggested when cleaning up rodent droppings to avoid inhaling contaminated air.

Headline: Britain's former top banker eyes Trudeau's job
Author: Ben King and Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon, UK and Toronto, Canada

Text: The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, is seen as the most likely successor to Justin Trudeau as the leader of Canada's Liberal Party. Does he have what it takes to be the face Canada's ongoing battle against President Trump's tariffs?
Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.
He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.
But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he is widely seen as the most likely successor in the contest to replace Trudeau, which comes to a head on Sunday evening local time.
If he wins, he will become Canada's prime minister during one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.
But holding onto that role will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October but many expect it to be called imminently, possibly right after a new Liberal leader - who would automatically become prime minister - is sworn in.
Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smit, in the Northwest Territories.
The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.
In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.
In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.
Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was transparent about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.
That move would end up being widely praised for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.
In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.
He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.
In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.
Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of "forward guidance", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.
Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an "unreliable boyfriend", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.
Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.
In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.
Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.
In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.
He described it as his "toughest day" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.
The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.
His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock "should be temporary".
Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.
From 2011 to 2018, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.
He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.
He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.
His political ambitions have been rumoured for years but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.
"Why don't I become a circus clown?" he told a reporter in 2012.
Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.
Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.
Now, both Carney and Freeland - who happen to be personal friends - are running to replace him, with Carney pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.
"I know how to manage crises," Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. "In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills."

Headline: Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on

Text: Not long after the US imposed their tariffs on Canada, a local neighbourhood pub in Toronto began removing all American products off their menu.
That means nachos, wings - and of course, beer - must all be made now with local Canadian ingredients, or wherever not possible, non-US products from Europe or Mexico.
For Leah Russell, manager at Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, the boycott was a no-brainer. She adds that it is "pretty set in stone," even if the tariffs themselves are not.
"I'm glad that we're getting rid of American products and supporting local businesses," Ms Russell told the BBC on Thursday. "I think it's an important thing to do."
This defiant stance in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats against Canada has been unfolding across the northern country, even as it braces for economic blowback that it could ultimately do little to avoid in the event of a full-blown trade war.
Just ask actor Jeff Douglas, once the face of Molson Canadian Beer's "I Am Canadian" advertisements, who has filmed and posted a light-hearted, but deeply-patriotic video on Youtube this week addressing Trump's "51st state" rhetoric.
"We're not the 51st anything," declares Mr Douglas in the video, which has since gone viral in Canada.
Some of the backlash has been more symbolic, like one Montreal café changing the Americano on their menu to a "Canadiano" - a small gesture that the owners say is meant to display unity and support for their community and country.
Even the CBC, the country's public broadcaster, is feeling the full force of this wave of patriotism, after it dared run a programme asking Canadians what they think about Canada becoming "the 51st state", as Trump has suggested many times.
The show sparked intense backlash and accusations of "treason," "sedition" and even "betrayal".
Although Trump has since lifted some of the tariffs imposed this week and put others on pause until 2 April, many Canadians say the damage has already been done.
After Thursday's reversal, foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that Canada has been shown "too much disrespect by the Trump administration at this point, calling us a 51st state, calling our prime minister 'governor.'"
Meanwhile, Doug Ford, who is the leader of Canada's most populous province, did not back down from his plan to slap export tariffs on electricity that Canada supplies some US states. The 25% surcharge will affect up to 1.5 million American homes.
"I feel terrible for the American people because it's not the American people, and it's not even elected officials, it's one person," he told a local radio show on Thursday in reference to Trump.
"He's coming after his closest friends, closest allies in the world and it's going to absolutely devastate both economies," Ford said.
Canadians support their country's reciprocal actions, saying they should remain in place until US tariffs are completely off the table.
"You go to bed every night and don't have any idea where you stand," said Andrew, a shopper at a Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) store in Toronto, which has stopped stocking US-made alcoholic drinks, like bourbon from Kentucky. Trump says he will delay the tariffs, "but what does that mean?" he asks.
"Let's keep [American-made drinks] off the shelves until we know what things are going to be from day to day."
The tariffs have been met with deep anxiety in Canada, whose majority of exports are sold to companies and clients in the US. Officials predict up to a million job losses if a 25% across the board levy went ahead, while economists warn that a recession is imminent if they persist.
The potential impact is devastating enough that the Canadian government has announced it will bring in relief measures, similar to those implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help impacted individuals and businesses.
Even with the tariffs being scaled back temporarily, the uncertainty alone is hurting both American and Canadian economies, says Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto.
"The most sensitive thing to uncertainty is business investment," Prof Gillezeau says, adding that firms are "not going to want to spend a dime anywhere" until they have some clarity.
Analysts suggest the mere whiff of a trade war is likely costing Canadian companies hundreds of thousands of dollars as they try to navigate through these changes, and are likely delaying deals and disrupting trade due to the confusion.
That trepidation is also seen in the stock market, which had erased virtually all its gains since Trump won the presidency in November.
Trump has repeatedly said that tariffs are a response to Mexico and Canada's role in the fentanyl crisis, which has killed over 250,000 American since 2018.
While only a small portion of the drug originates from Canada, press secretary Karen Leavitt said that even those numbers are significant for "families in this country who have lost loved ones to this deadly poison". Even small amounts of fentanyl can kill large number of people, she added.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the tariffs, suggesting they align with Trump's stated desire to see Canada become "the 51st state."
"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us," Trudeau told media in Ottawa Thursday.
Prof Gillezeau notes that it is an especially deep wound from a neighbour whom Canada had long considered its closest friend and ally.
The US and Canada have fought wars together, have boasted about having the longest "undefended" shared border in the world and have even engaged in joint security missions in the Arctic to defend each other's sovereignty.
"We've been allies for 100 years," he says, adding that many Canadians are likely upset not just with how the US has been treating Canada, but also other allies like Ukraine.
"We're a decent, honourable people, and we stand by our allies," Prof Gillezeau says. "I think that's what is driving the real depth of the discontent we see."
The Canadian boycotts are already having material impact. Canadian outlet Global News has reported that leisure travel bookings to the US have plunged 40% year over year, citing data from Flight Centre Canada. That decline has also been observed in land border crossings between British Columbia and Washington State.
Before the tariffs, the US was the number one international travel destination for Canadians, who have spent $20.5bn (£15.89bn) into the American tourism economy in 2024 alone.
Asked if this trend will hold, Prof Gillezeau says Canadians ideally want relations to go back to normal with their neighbour. But in absence of that, the consensus in the country is that "Canada needs to find friends elsewhere".

Headline: Canadian serial killer's victim found in landfill

Text: The remains of an indigenous woman murdered by a serial killer have been found after a search of a landfill in the Canadian province of Manitoba, police say.
Morgan Harris' remains were recovered at the Prairie Green Landfill, north of the city of Winnipeg, said officials. Authorities had been searching for Ms Harris, 39, and Marcedes Myran, 26, both of Long Plain First Nation. Police say two sets of remains have been found.
Ms Harris and Ms Myran were among four indigenous women killed in 2022 by convicted murderer Jeremy Skibicki, who dumped their bodies in two different landfills over a three-month span.
The search of the Prairie Green Landfill began late last year following a lengthy pressure campaign by indigenous leaders.
Cambria Harris, Morgan Harris's daughter, said in a Facebook post on Friday that the discovery of her mother's remains was a "very bittersweet moment".
"Please keep our families in your hearts tonight and every day going forward as we trust this process," the post said.
Police initially declined to search the landfill, and a federal government study concluded that a search could take three years and cost up to C$184m (£100m; $128m), with workers exposed to hazardous chemicals.
Manitoba eventually pledged C$20m to search for the remains - funds that were matched by the federal government.
Skibicki was convicted in July last year of the murders of Ms Harris and Ms Myran, as well as of killing a third woman, Rebecca Contois, 24, of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation, and a still-unidentified woman who has been given the name Buffalo Woman.
Their murders went undetected for months until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki's apartment found partial human remains, identified as belonging to Ms Contois.
Canada has long faced a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, indigenous women make up 10% of the population of missing women in Canada and 16% of female homicides. Indigenous women make up about 4% of the female population in Canada.

Headline: Double murderer is first US inmate executed by firing squad in 15 years
Author: Max Matza, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-08T00:33:57.954Z
Text: A South Carolina man convicted of bludgeoning his ex-girlfriend's parents to death has become the first US death row inmate to be executed by firing squad in the last 15 years.
Brad Sigmon was shot to death just after 18:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday by three state corrections department volunteers firing rifles at his chest with specially designed bullets.
Sigmon, 67, was convicted of murdering David and Gladys Larke with a baseball bat in 2001 before kidnapping his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint. She managed to escape as he shot at her.
He had requested death by firing squad over the other two state-approved methods of execution: electric chair and lethal injection.
This story contains details of the execution, some of which are graphic
Chrysti Shain, of the South Carolina Department of Corrections, said Sigmon was pronounced dead by a doctor at 18:08.
Three members of the Larke family were present to witness his death, she said, as well as Sigmon's spiritual adviser.
Sigmon was strapped to a chair, which had a basin underneath to catch blood, witnesses said.
He told witnesses he wanted his final statement "to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to help us end the death penalty".
"An eye for an eye was used as justification to the jury for seeking the death penalty," he added.
"At that time, I was too ignorant to know how wrong that was. Why? Because we no longer live under the Old Testament law but now live under the New Testament."
After his final statement, a hood was placed over his head.
A curtain that concealed three volunteers opened at 18:01. At 18:05, the trio fired from 15ft (4.6m) away without any countdown.
Jeffrey Collins, a reporter for the Associated Press news agency, said at a news conference that Sigmon had a red bullseye target placed over his heart.
When he was shot, his chest rose and fell several times, the reporter added.
A doctor performed an exam that took about 90 seconds, before declaring him dead.
The .308 Winchester Tap Urban bullets used are designed to break apart on impact and cause maximum damage. Medical experts have debated the amount of pain they may cause.
Anna Dobbins, a reporter for WHFF-TV, added that Sigmon had worn a black jump suit but his bare arms had "flexed" when he was shot.
All the shots were fired simultaneously, she said, and witnesses were unable to see the guns.
Prison guards also offered witnesses ear plugs to protect their ears from the sound of the shots, added a reporter for the Post and Courier newspaper.
Counselling services are being offered to any prison staff who were traumatised by the execution, said Ms Shain.
Sigmon's lawyer, Bo King, had been hoping for a last-minute stay of execution by the South Carolina governor and accused the state of withholding information about the lethal injection process.
"Brad only wanted assurances that these drugs were not expired, or diluted, or spoiled - what any of us would want to know about the medication we take, or the food we eat, much less the means of our death," he said in a statement after his death.
"It is unfathomable that, in 2025, South Carolina would execute one of its citizens in this bloody spectacle."
King said his client had been suffering from mental illness, and that the friendships he formed in prison were proof he had been rehabilitated.
"Brad is someone who, for his last meal, asked to get three buckets of original recipe Kentucky Fried Chicken so he could share with the guys that he's incarcerated with on death row," he told WYFF-TV earlier on Friday.
"With his last meal, he wanted to share something special with them," he said, later telling reporters that the request to share had been denied.
Officials later confirmed his last meal as four pieces of fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy, biscuits, cheesecake and sweet tea. The meal was served on Wednesday evening.
Since 1977 only three people had died by firing squad, all three of them in the state of Utah. The last to die had been Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010.
Ahead of Sigmon's execution, anti-death penalty protesters held a rally outside the jail in the city of Columbia.
They held signs saying "all life is precious" and "thou shalt not kill".
The state allows witnesses to observe the death from behind bulletproof glass, but the executioners are hidden from view to protect their identities.
South Carolina passed a law in 2023 requiring that the identities of the execution team members remain secret.

Headline: Actor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa died of natural causes one week apart
Author: Samantha Granville, BBC News, Los Angeles

Text: Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman died of natural causes about a week after his wife Betsy Arakawa, who died after contracting a rare virus, a New Mexico medical investigator has said.
Hackman, 95, died at his Santa Fe home from coronary artery disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease a contributing factor.
Ms Arakawa, 65, died in the same house from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Her cause of death was listed as natural.
Authorities believe she passed away about seven days before her husband, to whom she had been married for more than 30 years. During his career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.
It is likely that Ms Arakawa died first on 11 February, Dr Heather Jarrell of the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office told a news conference on Friday.
She said it was "reasonable to conclude" that Hackman had died on 18 February.
Ms Arakawa's last known movements and correspondence were on 11 February, when she was seen going to a grocery store, a CVS pharmacy and a pet store, before returning home in the early evening.
Given that Hackman was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease it is "quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased", said Dr Jarrell.
She told reporters she was "not aware of his normal daily functioning capability".
Hackman had "significant heart disease, and ultimately that's what resulted in his death", Dr Jarrell said, adding that he had had chronic high blood pressure.
He had not eaten anything recently, but had shown no indications of dehydration, she added.
At the news conference, New Mexico Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps emphasised that hantavirus infections were extremely rare.
HPS is transmitted through contact with rodent droppings, urine or saliva, often when contaminated dust is inhaled.
She noted that 136 cases had been reported in the state over the past 50 years, with 42% resulting in fatalities.
Dr Phipps said evidence of rodent activity had been found in some buildings on the property, though the risk inside the main house was considered "low".
Investigators are trying to determine how Ms Arakawa contracted the illness. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus.
The couple were found in their home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through the window.
The remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition.
Hackman's body was in a sideroom next to the kitchen, with a walking cane and a pair of sunglasses nearby, according to a search warrant affidavit.
Ms Arakawa's body was in the bathroom, with scattered pills close to her.
Sheriff's deputies found medication for thyroid and blood pressure treatment, along with pain reliever Tylenol, according to a court-filed inventory.
Citing privacy laws, authorities did not disclose who had been prescribed the drugs.
One of the couple's three dogs was also found dead inside a crate near Ms Arakawa, while the other two dogs were alive.
The cause of death for the dog is yet to be determined, officials say. Dr Phipps told reporters that dogs did not get sick from hantavirus.
Initial investigations found no signs of forced entry or foul play at the couple's $3.8m (£3m) home. Tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative, and no significant gas leaks were detected.
Hackman is survived by three adult children from his previous marriage.
Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.
He won best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.
A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.
Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.
He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.
Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.
His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.

Text: A rescue swimmer from the US Coast Guard pulled a 71-year-old woman from a vehicle that had steered into the McKenzie River in Oregon. A helicopter was used to lower the swimmer towards the car and hoist the woman to safety. A second vehicle occupant made it to the shore on their own.
"The response was complicated by high water, darkness, and the precarious location of the vehicle, which was stuck on a rock ledge in the middle of the McKenzie River," the Lane County Sheriff's Office said in a post on Facebook.
The woman suffered non-life threatening injuries and the second occupant was unharmed.

Text: Dolly Parton offered an emotional tribute to her late husband, Carl Thomas Dean, who died earlier this week.
The legendary country artist released a new song titled, If You Hadn't Been There, in an Instagram post on Friday.
"I fell in love with Carl Dean when I was 18 years old," Parton wrote. "We have spent 60 precious and meaningful years together. Like all great love stories, they never end. They live on in memory and song. He will always be the star of my life story, and I dedicate this song to him."
The pair were together for six decades before he died on Monday aged 82.
Her voice trembles as she sings the new song, "If you hadn't been there / Where would I be? / Without your trust, love, and belief".
"You made me drеam / More than I dared," she continues. "And I wouldn't be hеre / If you hadn't been there."
The cover of the track includes an old photo showing Parton with her arms wrapped around Dean.
Parton, 79, expressed her gratitude for fans' support after her husband's death.
"This is a love note to family, friends, and fans," she wrote on Instagram on Thursday. "Thank you for all the messages, cards, and flowers that you've sent to pay your respects for the loss of my beloved husband Carl. I can't reach out personally to each of you but just know it has meant the world to me. He is in God's arms now and I am okay with that. I will always love you."
The singer, known for songs such as 9-5 and Jolene, met Dean outside a laundromat the first day she arrived in Nashville as an 18-year-old aspiring singer.
"I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me)," Parton said when recalling their first meeting.
"He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about."
Two years later, in 1966, the pair married.
They lived a private life - Dean was rarely seen in public - and did not have children together.

Headline: Trump team hits pause on tariffs - but still sees them as vital tool

Text: It may have been drowned out this week as US President Donald Trump walked back tariffs on his closest neighbours - and biggest trading partners - almost as soon as they were in place.
But despite the dizzying back-and-forth with Canada and Mexico, the White House made clear that it is serious about its economic vision. And it is willing to pay the price of some short-term economic harm to pursue it.
"There'll be a little disturbance," Trump warned in his address to Congress on Tuesday. "But we're okay with that."
Some scepticism about that comfort might be understandable, given the abrupt policy turns on tariffs Trump has made, as financial markets dropped and the outcry from US businesses intensified.
Those who see Trump's tariff threats as economic bluster might be tempted to conclude that he wants to talk tough, but flinches at the first signs of economic damage.
But that view is to some extent undermined by the trade war against China he started in his first term which has seriously intensified.
In just a few weeks, Trump has raised taxes to at least 20% on all Chinese imports.
It means the average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, because taxes on some sectors - like electric vehicles and steel - stand at much higher rates.
The 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods hasn't completely gone away either. The levy still stands on goods that aren't compliant with a trade deal that Trump negotiated in his first term - and so some goods coming from both neighbours will still be subject to it.
The White House also says its much-touted reciprocal tariffs targeting nearly all US trade partners are still in the pipeline. The details, they say, will be unveiled on 2 April, with rates tailor-made to address whatever policies other countries impose that officials consider unfair - whether in the form of taxes on US tech firms, Value-Added Taxes, or other import rules.
"It's a certainty – reciprocal tariffs are coming," Trump's senior adviser on trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro told business broadcaster CNBC on Friday.
He said the White House had seen signs that its threats alone were prompting car companies to start taking action and bolster their supply chains in the US - exactly the kind of investment that Donald Trump says his tariffs will spur.
"They're getting the picture," Navarro said.
Navarro and others say the nitty-gritty of tariff rates is not their focus. Rather, they are using trade levies as a means to create a new version of America, where the country has a different relationship with its global partners.
That America has more local manufacturing, a smaller government and pays less for the military defence of its allies.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent - a former Wall Street hedge fund boss not known as a tariff hawk - this week pointed to political discussions in Germany about boosting its military spending as an "early, big win".
"The international trading system consists of a web of relationships - military economic, political. One cannot take a single aspect in isolation," he said, as he tried to sell the administration's strategy to a tariff-sceptical audience at the Economic Club of New York.
"This is how President Trump sees the world - not as a zero-sum game but as inter-linkages that can be re-ordered to advance the interests of American people."
For Trump, tariffs are a key tool for re-ordering that web. And the treasury secretary made clear that the likely short-term harm - higher prices - is an acceptable trade-off.
"Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream," Bessent said.
For now, polls indicate Trump's voter base remains behind him. But how the next months unfold - and what happens in particular with consumer prices - could prove a real test of that message.

Headline: Hackman and wife died of natural causes several days apart, officials say

Text: US investigators believe Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his classical pianist wife, Betsy Arakawa, both died of natural causes about a week apart.
Their bodies were discovered in their home in the US state of New Mexico on 26 February, 10 days after Hackman is believed to have died.
In a press conference on Friday, officials said Hackman died from "significant heart disease" on 18 February, according to cardiac data obtained from his pacemaker.
Arakawa died a week earlier on 11 February of complications related to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents.
The medical examiner added that Hackman was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, which meant it was "possible" he was not aware of his wife's death in the days after.
Here is what we know about the death of a Hollywood legend known for such films as The French Connection and The Conversation.
Warning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting
The bodies of the couple and one of their dogs were found by police on Wednesday at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a maintenance worker called emergency services.
In a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.
Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park.
The couple appeared to have been "dead for quite a while", said Sheriff Adan Mendoza last month.
Arakawa's body showed signs of "decomposition", and "mummification" in the hands and feet, a sheriff's detective said.
Hackman's remains "showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent" with those on his spouse.
A German Shepherd dog owned by the couple was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Arakawa.
No cause was given in police statements immediately after the announcement of the deaths.
The authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths "suspicious enough" to investigate and did not rule out foul play.
A carbon monoxide poisoning test came out negative for both Arakawa and Hackman, the Santa Fe Sheriff's office said on Friday.
Near Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she had abruptly fallen to the ground.
An autopsy and toxicology tests had been requested for both Hackman and Arakawa. Authorities said it could be a few months before the results of those are released.
The local utility company found no sign of a gas leak in the area and the fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.
A prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body. Prescription pills found in the home were common medications for thyroid and high blood pressure, according to a search warrant.
Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane lay next to his body.
The detective suspected that the actor had suffered a sudden fall.
At the time, the circumstances of their deaths were deemed "suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation", the search warrant said, because the worker who called emergency services had found the front door of the property open.
However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside.
"There was no indication of a struggle," said Sheriff Mendoza. "There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed, you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred."
Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one out.
Authorities said Hackman's pacemaker last registered activity on 17 February, adding that this gives them a good assumption that was his last day of life.
But police said it is unclear who died first - Hackman or Arakawa. Now, they know Arakawa died first.
The two maintenance workers who found the couple, one of whom called the emergency services, said they last had contact with the couple two weeks earlier.
The two said they had sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw Hackman and Arakawa.
They had communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Arakawa.
Hackman's daughter Leslie Anne Hackman told the Mail Online that her father had been in "very good physical condition" despite his age, and had not undergone "any major surgeries" in recent months.
"He liked to do Pilates and yoga, and he was continuing to do that several times a week," she said. "So he was in good health."
The couple, married in 1991, had had a "wonderful marriage", she added.
"I give credit to his wife, Betsy, for keeping him alive,' she said. '[Betsy] took very, very good care of him and was always looking out for his health."

Headline: Meghan's new Netflix show renewed for second series

Text: The Duchess of Sussex has announced that With Love, Meghan will be back for a second series.
The eight-part Netflix show, which sees Meghan share cooking, gardening and hosting tips with friends and famous guests at a California estate, launched on the streaming platform on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the former Suits actress officially launched her new brand As Ever, with an updated website revealing raspberry spread and flower sprinkes will be among the first products to be sold.
Tudum, the official companion site to Netflix, confirmed that filming had completed on the second season of the show and it will be streamed in the autumn.
The announcement came after the first series attracted critical reviews in both the UK and the US.
Since its launch on Tuesday, one review in The Guardian described it as a "gormless lifestyle filler" and "so pointless it might be the Sussexes' last TV show", while The Telegraph gave it two stars and branded it "insane" and an "exercise in narcissism".
The series has a rating of 33% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.
However, the BBC's royal correspondent Sean Coughlan wrote that "the new Netflix series...is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day".
The show centres around Meghan preparing treats, foods and gifts at a beautiful property, although not her own home, in Montecito.
She makes pasta, crudités, focaccia, frittata and baked fish, and along with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows viewers how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.
Guests in the first series include American actress and producer Mindy Kaling, celebrity chef Roy Choi, designer Tracy Robbins and cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson.
On Friday, Meghan posted a video to Instagram which showed her wearing a hat with the writing "lettuce romaine calm" stitched across the front of it.
The caption read: "Lettuce romaine calm... or not (!) because I'm thrilled to share that Season 2 of 'With Love, Meghan' is coming!"
In a second post, she wrote: "If you're loving Season 1, just wait until you see the fun we cooked up on Season 2!
"Thanks for joining the party, and an endless thanks to the amazing team and crew who helped bring it all to life!"
The first series was originally due to air in January but was postponed until March due to the Los Angeles wildfires.
In a statement at the time, Netflix described the upcoming programme as a "heartfelt tribute to the beauty of southern California", adding that it was delaying its launch due to "ongoing devastation" in the US state.

Headline: 'I'm freaking out': Text messages show housemates' panic during Idaho students' murders
Author: Ana Faguy, BBC News

Text: Newly released text messages and phone calls show the fear of two University of Idaho students as someone broke into their home and murdered four of their housemates in 2022.
"I'm freaking out," one roommate wrote to the other, court filings obtained by US media reportedly show.
The text messages were sent nearly eight hours before the roommates called authorities to report one of their roommates unconscious at their home.
The trial of Bryan Kohberger, who was arrested in the roommates' murders and has pleaded not guilty to those charges, is scheduled to start later this year.
The fatal stabbings of four University of Idaho students - Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen - in their off-campus home on 13 November, shocked Moscow, Idaho, a small college town and the nation.
Two other housemates, identified in court filings as D.M. and B.F., are presumed to be Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke, who both lived in the house and survived the attack. Newly released communications between the two offer some insight into what happened during the hours when police believe the murders occurred and in the aftermath.
"No one is answering," D.M. texted B.F. between 4:22 a.m. and 4:24 a.m. "I'm rlly confused rn."
"Kaylee," D.M. texted Goncalves. "What's going on." And then to B.F.: "I'm freaking out rn."
In the messages to B.F., D.M. references someone in "like a ski mask almost" in the house.
B.F. replies, "Stfu".
"I'm not kidding," D.M. writes, adding she is "so freaked out."
"Come to my room," B.F. says. "Run."
Prosecutors want to use these messages to piece together the timeline of the early autumn morning. Both housemates are expected to testify at the capital murder trial scheduled for August.
A call to police, also detailed in the new fillings, was made just after the "unresponsive body" of Kernodle was found, and hours after the intruder was first spotted in the house.
"Um, one of our -- one of the roommates who's passed out and she was drunk last night and she's not waking up," the caller tells authorities, according to the transcript.
One of the surviving housemates previously told investigators that noise woke her early that morning, but when she looked outside her bedroom, she did not see anything.
Later, she told investigators, when she opened her door again, she saw a masked man in black clothing walking toward her. He walked by her towards a sliding glass door and she locked herself in her room.
Officials said they think that's when the suspect left the home.
The suspect in the case, Mr Kohberger, was a Washington State University graduate student in criminology. He was arrested in December 2022, six weeks after the murders. He was indicted in May 2023.
Prosecutors claim they have DNA evidence tying Mr Kohberger to the crime scene and are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted.
Meanwhile, Mr Kohberger's attorneys have questioned the accuracy of the DNA testing and have asked for the death penalty to be taken off the table.

Headline: Second person dies in US measles outbreak

Text: A measles outbreak in the American southwest has killed a second person, an unvaccinated adult, New Mexico health officials have said.
The fatality comes roughly a week after measles took the life of an unvaccinated child in nearby Texas, the first US death from the disease since 2015.
Measles, which was considered "eliminated" in the US in 2000, is spreading quickly in Texas, with the state identifying 198 cases as of Friday, nearly 30 more since the state's last report on Tuesday. In the same span the number of cases in neighbouring New Mexico tripled, to 30.
The disease has also been reported in other states and across Canada, as well.
The person who died in New Mexico was a resident of Lea County, about 50 miles (80km) from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak appears to be centred.
Officials did not provide the person's sex or age.
One in every five measles cases requires hospitalisation and about three in every 1,000 cases results in death, the New Mexico health department said on Thursday.
The current outbreak killed a healthy but unvaccinated six-year-old in Texas, state officials said on 27 Feb.
While the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US often sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases.
Still, the two deaths are jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded anyone killed by measles since 2015. The 2015 death was the first one attributed to measles in the US since 2003.
Three months into 2025, the total number of reported infections in the US has already climbed above 220. There were 285 cases over the entire year of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
The CDC has said it is monitoring the current outbreak, which is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community in Texas with low vaccination rates.
While the outbreak is mostly occurring in Texas and New Mexico, measles has also recently been found in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington according to the CDC.
Canada is also seeing a spike in infections, and recorded more cases in the first two months of this year than in all of 2024, the country's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said on Thursday.
Measles has been found in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which Dr Tam attributed to travellers who were exposed to the disease in another country.
As of Thursday, there were 227 measles cases reported this year in Canada and most of those who became ill were not vaccinated, according to the country's public health agency.
The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and they also immunise people against mumps and rubella.
US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - who is known in part for being a vaccine sceptic - published an editorial on Sunday expressing his concern about the growing measles outbreak.
"Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinate due to medical reasons," he wrote in Fox News Op-Ed.

Headline: Four big things Trump and his team took on this week
Author: Alex Boyd, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-07T16:56:23.975Z
Text: US President Donald Trump continued to shock allies this week after his fiery exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.
His seventh week in office saw military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine paused, while Zelensky sought to repair relations and a possible peace deal by saying he was "ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership".
At the start of the week, Trump imposed tariffs on close US allies Canada and Mexico and increased them on key trade partner China. Later, the president signed exempted a number of Canadian and Mexican goods from cost hikes.
At home, the US president delivered the longest presidential speech to Congress on record.
If you are in need of a catch up, here are four big items Trump and his team took on this week.
The dramatic shift in the US's relationship with Ukraine continued this week. Trump administration officials made two separate announcements: First, that America would pause its practice of providing Kyiv with military aid - and then that they had paused intelligence sharing as well.
National Security Adviser Mike Waltz told reporters that the Trump administration was pausing and reviewing "all aspects of this relationship", but did suggest that it could be lifted at a later date.
In the meantime, officials said that US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered the military to pause its offensive cyber operations against Russia as a diplomatic push continues to end the war in Ukraine.
These pauses could have a significant effect on Ukraine's ability to the fight the war, though it could be weeks until the cut of aid is felt while existing stocks are used up.
A lack of US intelligence may also hinder Ukraine in planning offensive operations, and giving Kyiv advance warning of incoming Russian attacks.
The cut also hit closer to home in the US in Scranton, Pennsylvania - where there is a plant producing key munition that has been sent to Ukraine, and a community with a "very proud history" of supporting Kyiv.
Since the Oval Office meeting, the Ukrainians have worked to get the relationship back on the right footing. He sent Trump a letter agreeing to "come to the negotiating table"for the rare earth minerals deal and a larger peace agreement.
Meanwhile, European leaders continued to hold discussions about increasing support to Ukraine and bolster their own defence spending, in light of developments in the US.
US stock markets sunk at the start of the week after Trump confirmed he was moving forward with 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada.
In the days that followed, the Trump administration announced that it would be temporarily sparing carmakers from the import levies. The next day, the president signed an executive order that placed a number of other exemptions on various goods - which helped to boost US shares.
There was a notable difference in tone between Trump's dealings with the US's neighbours in the north and south.
He said the postponement of some tariffs on Mexico was "as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum", and described their relationship as "a very good one".
Though a war of words was evident in dealings with Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the US tariffs "dumb", but the country's finance minister said it would hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.
Later in the week, Trudeau said he had had a "colourful" conversation with Trump about the fees and warned that a trade war between the two allies would probably continue.
The White House confirmed it had held direct talks with Hamas over the release of remaining hostages held in Gaza.
Washington had until then avoided direct engagement with the group, and there was a longstanding American policy against contacting entities it had listed a terrorist organisation. It also meant bypassing a close US ally - Israel.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office responded with a terse statement, saying only that it had "expressed its position" on the talks.
But this was not necessarily a softening of tone toward Hamas. Trump also issued what he called a "last warning" to the group, demanding that they release the remaining Israeli hostages.
"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say," he added in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform. He did not specify the nature of that support.
Hamas accused the US president of encouraging Israel to break the ceasefire deal currently in effect between the two sides.
It is not the first time Trump has threatened Hamas. In December, he said there would be "all hell to pay" if hostages were not released by the time he took office.
Trump addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington for the first time this week since he returned to power.
In the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, he outlined his vision for his second term, as Republicans applauded the president's first six weeks that has reshaped domestic and foreign policy.
Trump was heckled by Democrats and he goaded them in turn during the rowdy primetime address, claiming that his administration was "just getting started".
Early in the speech, Texas Democrat Al Green was ejected from the House chamber for disrupting Trump's address, and Congress later voted to censure him.
Trump spoke of relations with Ukraine, and repeated his desire for the US to acquire Greenland.
Domestically, his speech predicted some economic turbulence because of the tariffs he had imposed. He also stood by billionaire adviser Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and slash federal programmes.
Trump has since suggested on social media that he may allow his cabinet to have greater power in an effort to be "very precise as to who will remain, and who will go."
"We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet,'" he added, promising agency leaders and Musk would work together effectively.

Text: Former Olympic snowboarder and Canadian national Ryan Wedding, 43, has been placed on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list for allegedly running a violent transnational drug trafficking network.
Wedding is wanted for allegedly shipping hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and southern California, to Canada and US locations, and for orchestrating multiple murders and an attempted murder to further these drug crimes.
The US is offering a reward of up to $10m (£7.7m) for information leading to Wedding's arrest or conviction.
Investigators believe he is living in Mexico, but have not ruled out his presence in the US, Canada, other Latin American countries or elsewhere.
It was not clear if he has a lawyer.
Wedding competed in Giant Slalom snowboarding for Canada during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
His aliases include "El Jefe," "Giant," "Public Enemy," "James Conrad King," and "Jesse King," the FBI said.
In June 2024, Wedding and his accomplice Andrew Clark, 34, also Canadian, were charged in California with running a continuing criminal enterprise, committing murder in connection with the enterprise and assorted drug crimes, and conspiring to possess, distribute, and export cocaine.
Clark was arrested last October by Mexican authorities and was among 29 fugitives extradited to the US from Mexico last week.
The US indictment alleges that Wedding and Clark directed the 20 November 2023 murders of two family members in Ontario, Canada, in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment that passed through southern California. Another family member survived the shooting but was left with serious physical injuries, the FBI said.
Wedding and Clark allegedly also ordered the murder of another victim on 18 May 2024 over a drug debt, according to the FBI.
"The alleged murders of his competitors make Wedding a very dangerous man, and his addition to the list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, coupled with a major reward offer by the State Department, will make the public our partner so that we can catch up with him before he puts anyone else in danger," Akil Davis, the assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, said in a press release on Thursday.

Headline: South Carolina man to be executed in US by firing squad
Author: Ottilie Mitchell, BBC News

Text: A South Carolina prison inmate convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents with a baseball bat will be the first person in the US to be executed by firing squad in 15 years.
If Brad Sigmon's execution proceeds on Friday at 18:00 local time (23:00 GMT), three state corrections department volunteers standing behind a curtain will simultaneously fire rifles at his chest with specially designed bullets.
The state's procedure requires that those put to death by firing squad be strapped to a chair when they enter the execution chamber. The inmate then has a target placed on his heart and a bag put over his head.
Sigmon, 67, was convicted of murdering David and Gladys Larke in 2001 before kidnapping his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint. She later escaped as he shot at her.
Offered the alternatives of death by electric chair or lethal injection, Sigmon's lawyers said he chose the more violent process because of his concerns about the effectiveness of the other two methods.
He will be the first person to be executed by firing squad in the US since 2010, and only the fourth since the country reintroduced the death penalty in 1976.
Sigmon was charged with murder in 2001 after investigators said he killed his ex-girlfriend's parents in their home in Greenville County by alternately beating them with a bat.
He also told detectives that he planned to harm his ex-girlfriend before she escaped.
"I couldn't have her. I wasn't going to let anybody else have her," he told them.
The South Carolina Supreme Court this week rejected a request from Sigmon's lawyers to intervene. They wanted more time to learn about the drug South Carolina uses in lethal injections and questioned whether his 2002 legal representation was adequate.
That is expected to be his final appeal ahead of Friday's planned execution.
No South Carolina governor has granted clemency to an inmate facing execution since the US legalised the death penalty again in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Execution by firing squad is complex.
Sigmon will be strapped in a chair with a basin built below it to catch his blood. A target will be placed on his chest and a bag over his head.
Three state corrections department volunteers hidden behind a curtain will then fire at him from 15ft (4.6m) away.
The bullets used are designed to break apart on impact and cause maximum damage. Medical experts have debated the amount of pain caused by their use.
After the shots are fired, a doctor will confirm Sigmon's death.
The state allows witnesses to observe the death from behind bulletproof glass, but the executioners will be hidden from view to protect their identities.
South Carolina passed a law in 2023 requiring that the the identities of the execution team members remain secret. It also forbids the publication of information regarding the procurement of lethal injection drugs, as a growing number of pharmaceutical companies have declined to provide them for state executions.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit challenging the state law in January.
South Carolina spent $54,000 (£41,841) constructing its firing squad area in 2022 as suppliers refused to provide prison officials with the lethal chemicals required for death by injection.
The 2023 law now shields many details about the lethal injection procedure, as well, including the names of suppliers and the exact contents.
Most inmates sentenced to death in the state are electrocuted, but the three most recent executions were by injections that included pentobarbital. The three men were declared dead 20 minutes after being given the injection, though they appeared to stop breathing after a few minutes.
The lack of information about these executions has attracted criticism for its lack of transparency.
"This ban not only further departs from the state's history of making execution-related information publicly available but criminalizes the disclosure of this information by anyone for any reason," The ACLU argued in its legal complaint.
"It thus silences the scientists, doctors, journalists, former correctional officials, lawyers, and citizens who have scrutinized the safety, efficacy, morality, and legality of South Carolina's use of lethal injection."
Sigmon has expressed concern about the effectiveness of lethal injection.
South Carolina has released only one of two available autopsies from these deaths, which Sigmon's lawyer say show unusual amounts of fluid in the person's lungs.
Speaking about the decision not to die by injection, his attorney told AP: "He does not wish to inflict that pain on his family, the witnesses, or the execution team. But, given South Carolina's unnecessary and unconscionable secrecy, Brad is choosing as best he can."
Nationally, only three people have died by firing squad since 1976.

Headline: SpaceX rocket explodes, raining debris from sky for second time in a row
Author: Max Matza, BBC News

Text: A SpaceX rocket exploded shortly after it was launched from Texas on Thursday, grounding flights and triggering warnings about falling spaceship debris.
SpaceX confirmed the un-crewed ship had suffered "a rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ascent into space, and lost contact with the ground.
The massive SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever created, spun out of control shortly after its launch. No injuries or damage have been reported but images from those in Caribbean Sea island nations show fiery debris raining from the sky.
This was the eighth mission to test the rocket, and its second consecutive failure.
The spaceship, which measures 123m (403ft) at takeoff, was meant to re-enter Earth's orbit over the Indian Ocean after a one-hour flight.
Its Super Heavy booster, which helps it leave the ground, did manage successfully to return to the launchpad.
SpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said teams immediately started co-ordinating with safety officials for "pre-planned contingency responses".
The statement added that SpaceX would review data "to better understand [the] root cause" of the misfire and noted the explosion happened after the loss of "several" engines.
"As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability."
The statement says debris should have fallen within a pre-planned area and the rocket did not contain any toxic materials. The company also included an email and phone number for those who believe they've found any remnants of the craft.
Musk has yet to comment on Thursday's explosion.
The accident briefly halted flights at several Florida airports, including in Miami and Orlando, over concerns about flaming debris.
A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the flights in and out of airports were delayed due to a "space launch incident".
The incident follows a test in January, which saw a Starship rocket fail minutes after launching from SpaceX's Texas facility.
The FAA also briefly closed airports two months ago, due to the same concerns about falling debris.
After January's incident, the FAA grounded Starship launches and noted the incident had led to property damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.
"Unfortunately this happened last time too, so we have some practice at this now," SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot told reporters at the launch site on Thursday.
This latest Starship launch was conducted before the FAA finished investigating January's explosion, according to US media reports.
A statement issued from the government of the Turks and Caicos said they were in contact with US authorities and SpaceX and would "continue to keep the public apprised as we work to ensure the safety and security of our Islands".
Footage posted on X purported to show flaming rocket debris falling over the Caribbean Sea. In the Bahamas, people posted that they were seeking shelter in order to take cover from debris.
Starship is the biggest, most powerful rocket ever built, and is key to Musk's ambitions for colonising Mars.
SpaceX's Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket - collectively referred to as Starship - is intended to be fully reusable, the company says.
Nasa hopes to use a modified version of the spaceship as a human lunar lander for its Artemis missions to return to the Moon.
In the more distant future, Musk wants Starship to make long-haul trips to Mars and back - about a nine-month trip each way.

Text: Adnan Syed, whose criminal conviction was made famous in the hit true-crime podcast Serial, will not have to serve any additional jail time after being resentenced in the murder of his ex-girlfriend.
A Baltimore judge ruled that Syed "is not a danger to the public", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News, and that "the interests of justice will be served better by a reduced sentence".
Syed was convicted in the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee and sentenced to life in prison.
His case spawned the Serial podcast, which questioned key evidence in the case and helped lead to his resentencing.
Syed's conviction in the murder case still stands. His resentencing was possible under a law that allows for sentence reductions for people convicted as minors and have spent more than 20 years in prison.
Baltimore City Circuit Judge Jennifer Schiffer made the ruling in court on Tuesday.
Syed and Min Lee were classmates in high school in Maryland when Lee disappeared in January 1999. Her body was found in a forest three weeks later.
Syed, then 17, was found guilty of first degree murder in February 2000, and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors at the time alleged Syed carried out the crime after becoming jealous of Lee's new relationship after the two broke up.
In 2014, Syed's case gained national attention through the true-crime podcast 'Serial', which was listened to by millions of people.
The podcast raised questions about the evidence provided by prosecutors and witnesses that appeared at his trial, and it explored the effectiveness of Syed's attorney.
Fans of the podcast have donated more than $80,000 to Syed's legal fund, according to CBS News.
Syed was cleared of all charges in 2022 after prosecutors said he had been wrongfully convicted.
But his conviction was reinstated a year later in 2023 after an appeals court found that the lower court had failed to give the victim's brother sufficient notice of the hearing that freed Syed.
Judge Schiffer's ruling on Tuesday allows for Syed to remain free. Now 43, he has been out of prison since 2022.

Headline: California governor says trans athletes in female sports 'deeply unfair'
Author: Christal Hayes, BBC News, Los Angeles

Text: California Governor Gavin Newsom has broken with many elected Democrats by saying he thinks it is "deeply unfair" to allow transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.
Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender who leads one of the most liberal states in the US and has long been a trailblazer on LGBT rights, made the comments on his new podcast.
"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that," Newsom told conservative figure Charlie Kirk. "It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair. We've got to own that. We've got to acknowledge it."
Newsom's change of tone comes amid a debate within his party over the extent to which cultural factors played a role in their resounding defeat in November, when Republicans won the White House and both chambers of Congress.
A number of Democrats quickly denounced the governor's comments.
"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks," a statement from California's LGBT legislative caucus read.
On the debut episode of the governor's podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, his first guest was a pro-Trump activist whose Turning Point USA organisation advocates for conservative ideas on liberal-leaning college campuses.
The two discussed why Democratic nominee Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, and Newsom said his party was being politically "crushed" on transgender issues.
The governor referred to a viral Trump campaign ad that had the tagline: "Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you."
"It was devastating," Newsom said. "And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating."
Kirk argued that Democrats were out of touch with everyday Americans because of broad support within the party for transgender athletes competing in sports, which he said was unfair.
"I revere sports," said Newsom. "So, the issue of fairness is completely legit."
The governor added: "The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well."
Former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called Newsom's remarks about trans athletes "disgusting".
Pramila Jayapal, a left-wing Democrat representing a district in the north-western state of Washington, told Politico that her party should not "take the bait and give into their anti-trans people rhetoric".
But one moderate Democratic lawmaker agreed.
Seth Moulton, of Massachusetts, told Politico that Newsom was correct and polling shows it.
"More and more are willing to say what they've probably always thought - and that's a good thing," he said.
According to an opinion survey in January by the New York Times/Ipsos, almost all Republicans and nearly seven in 10 Democrats oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women's sports.
Throughout his career, Newsom has positioned himself to the left of his party on LGBT rights.
He made headlines in 2004 as San Francisco mayor when he ordered the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licences, which at the time wasn't allowed under state or federal law.
Newsom made the state the first sanctuary for transgender youth and protected school curriculums that included LGBT history.
Last year he signed legislation that made California the first state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify parents if their child changed gender identity.

Text: Pamela Bach, the former Baywatch actress and ex-wife of David Hasselhoff, has died aged 62.
Bach was found at home in the Hollywood Hills on 5 March after she died by suicide, said the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's office.
She met Hasselhoff while acting with him on the set of TV series Knight Rider, and the two married in 1989. She went on to star alongside him on lifeguard TV drama Baywatch before their divorce in 2006.
"Our family is deeply saddened by the recent passing of Pamela Hasselhoff," Hasselhoff said in a statement.
"We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time but we kindly request privacy as we grieve and navigate through this challenging time."
Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bach began acting in the 1970s. She and Hasselhoff have two daughters together.
Her acting credits included soap opera The Young and the Restless, Cheers, The Fall Guy, T.J. Hooker, Superboy and Viper.
Her daughter, Hayley Amber Hasselhoff, posted a photo of her parents on Instagram, with a white star, in apparent tribute to her mother.
In Bach's last Instagram post, published on New Year's Eve, she wrote about being excited to welcome 2025.
She said she was also excited to watch her granddaughter, London, "grow and seeing her smile light up my world is truly the greatest blessing".
"May 2025 be filled with beautiful moments, laughter, and all the blessings your hearts can hold," she continued.
"Here's to a year of making cherished memories, spreading joy, and embracing every precious moment!"
Bach's representative, Sharon Kelly, told TMZ she was shocked by her death.
"My heart goes out to her family, her beautiful daughters and granddaughter who Pamela constantly gushes about and loves so dearly," she said.

Headline: Democrat Al Green censured for disrupting Trump speech
Author: Ana Faguy and Brandon Drenon, BBC News, Washington DC
Published Date: 2025-03-06T22:20:07.073Z
Text: The US Congress has voted to censure Texas Democrat Al Green, who was ejected from the House chamber on Tuesday after disrupting President Donald Trump's address to the nation.
Ten Democrats sided with Republicans to punish Green for heckling and waving his cane at Trump during the president's joint session of Congress.
The resolution, which said Green's behaviour was "a breach of proper conduct", passed by 224 to 198 votes.
After the vote was held, the long-serving Democrat was ordered to stand in the well of the House chamber while the resolution was read aloud.
The culmination of the vote resulted in a shouting match between Republicans and Democrats in the chamber.
Green and fellow Democrats began singing "We Shall Overcome", which appeared to frustrate some Republicans on the floor.
Republican Dan Meuser at one point told Democrat Ayanna Pressley, "Al was wrong," leading Pressley to respond: "your members do the same thing," according to The Hill.
Pressley was likely referring to the headline-generating disruptions by Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert during Joe Biden's 2022 State of the Union speech.
After the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson said "this is a really sad day for our institution", but also said it was "critically important" to "maintain the dignity of this place".
"That was the first time that any member of congress had to be removed in the middle of a presidential address," Johnson, a Republican, said.
The top Democrat in the House, Hakeem Jeffries, had a different view, saying the censure resolution was "not worth the piece of paper that it was written on".
"Republicans are playing political and partisan games with their censure resolutions, because they are on the run" from issues like the economy, he said at a news conference.
He did not comment on Green's behaviour specifically and earlier in the week had encouraged lawmakers to have a "dignified" presence in the chamber.
Hours after his censure, Green wrote on X: "I accept the consequences of my actions, but I refuse to stay silent in the face of injustice."
He also announced that he "absolutely" planned to file articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, during a TMZ interview.
He said the decision was based on the president's "incivility", noting that Trump mocked Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and called her "Pocahontas" during his address.
"We cannot allow him to just continue to step on us like that," Green said.
With Republicans in control of the House and Senate, the impeachment effort is almost certain to fail.
Green's fellow Democrats had attempted to block the censure vote, with some arguing his decision to stand, wave his cane and heckle Trump was a legitimate act of protest.
The measure was introduced by congressman Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington, who said the decision to call for Green to be censured was not an easy one.
"We cannot ignore the wilful disruption intended to stop a proceeding," Newhouse said on Wednesday. "Without decorum, without respect, what do we got? What do we have, truly?"
On Tuesday, just minutes into Trump's address, Green stood up and shouted: "Mr President, you don't have a mandate!"
House Speaker Mike Johnson told Green to take his seat and "maintain decorum", but Green refused. Johnson then ordered his removal from the chamber.
Green is a fierce critic of President Trump, and called for the impeachment of the president during his first term in office.
The 10 Democrats who voted to censure Green were members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, and included Rep Jim Himes from Connecticut, who said he supported the measure because he had also voted to censure a Republican for heckling Barack Obama in 2009.
"At the end of the day, I think we need to stand up for the things that we believe regardless of which party benefits or loses," Himes said.
A censure is a formal statement of disapproval that requires a majority vote in the House to pass. It does not remove a member from Congress.
Censures are relatively rare occurrences, though in recent years they have become more common.
Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, was censured in 2023 for comments she made over the Israel-Gaza war.
Also in 2023, now former Congressman Jamaal Bowman, was censured for falsely pulling a fire alarm while Congress was in session.
Twenty-eight members of the House have been censured in total.

Headline: Hunter Biden says he can't afford to continue laptop-related lawsuit
Author: Samantha Granville, BBC News, Los Angeles
Published Date: 2025-03-06T20:53:32.185Z
Text: Hunter Biden has told a federal judge he is facing severe financial difficulties and cannot afford to move forward with his lawsuit against a former aide to President Donald Trump.
The son of former President Joe Biden sued Garrett Ziegler in 2023, accusing him and his non-profit Marco Polo of breaking the law by publishing an online database containing 128,000 emails taken from a laptop attributed to Mr Biden.
Mr Ziegler has previously dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous".
In a court filing on Wednesday, Mr Biden's attorneys asked US District Judge Hernan D Vera to end the lawsuit, stating that he "has suffered a significant downturn in his income and has significant debt in the millions of dollars range".
Mr Biden has also faced a series of financial setbacks, with January's wildfire in the Pacific Palisades - where he was staying - making his rental home "unliveable" for an extended period, according to the court papers.
Along with struggling to find stable housing and deal with fire damage, Mr Biden is having difficulties earning a steady income, according to the filing, and major sources of money have dried up.
Mr Biden is unable to borrow and sales of both his art and his memoir - his two major income streams - have fallen off over the last 18 months, according to the filing.
He had sold 27 pieces of art for an average price of $54,500 in the years leading up to the lawsuit. He has sold only one piece for $36,000 since.
Book sales for his memoir, Beautiful Things, dropped from more than 3,100 copies between April and September 2023 to roughly 1,100 in the following six months.
Mr Biden also has other lawsuits currently working through the court system and is assessing which ones he believes are worthwhile to continue, according to the filing.
Mr Biden and Mr Ziegler's legal teams have not returned the BBC's request for comment.
The judge had previously denied a motion to dismiss from Mr Ziegler and ordered him to pay roughly $18,000 in Mr Biden's legal fees.
A laptop abandoned by Mr Biden at a Delaware repair shop, and the seedy contents of its hard drive, featured prominently in the 2020 presidential campaign, and became a frequent focus for Republican lawmakers while his father was in the White House.
The Biden team argued at the time the laptop was part of a "smear campaign" engineered by Russian disinformation, but the hard drive has been authenticated by US media and is in the possession of the FBI.
Last year, Mr Biden was convicted of federal gun charges and pleaded guilty in a federal tax case.
President Biden pardoned him in December before his sentencing in the gun case.

Headline: US lost a fifth of its butterflies within two decades

Text: Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study.
Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York.
A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.
However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.
The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly "abundance" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.
This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.
Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.
The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.
"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering," said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.
Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.
The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.
"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe," Prof Grames said.
Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers.
Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems.
They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species.
Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses.
"Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants," Prof Grames explained.
The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection.
Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery.
"Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances," Prof Grames said.
She also stressed the need for government action.
"Insects are fundamental to life on earth, and we need conservation actions and policies that support insects."

Headline: What does the Department of Education do - and can Trump dismantle it?
Author: Ana Faguy, BBC News, Washington DC
Published Date: 2025-03-06T10:02:24.444Z
Text: President Donald Trump is considering an executive order that would shut down the US Department of Education - a long-cherished goal of conservatives.
The move would deliver on a promise he made on the campaign trail.
Trump plans to end some of the department's programmes, while others would be housed within different parts of the government, according to US media reports.
The Republican president will direct his newly confirmed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to "take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Education Department" based on "the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law", according to a draft of the order seen by the Wall Street Journal.
Abolishing the department entirely requires an act of Congress, however.
Established in 1979, the Department of Education oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.
Trump and his allies have accused the agency of "indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material".
In December, he nominated former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and his transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, as his pick for education secretary.
A common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts.
The agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university.
It also helps fund programmes to support students with disabilities and for students living in poverty.
And the department enforces civil rights law designed to prevent race or sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools.
The department's allocation was $238bn (£188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget.
The agency says it has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department.
Most public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments.
In 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil.
On his own, no.
Not only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of the department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US Senate - 60 out of 100 senators.
Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would need at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political longshot.
Even in the House of Representatives, Trump would struggle to gain necessary support.
A vote last year to abolish the education department - which was attached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans joined all Democrats in the House to vote no.
Trump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent weeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves.
An earlier draft of Trump's order to dismantle the education department, obtained last month by the Washington Post, acknowledged that only Congress can get rid of the agency outright, but executive action could direct the agency to begin to wind itself down.
Education department employees are among those who are the focus of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce.
The idea of eliminating the education department has been floated by Republicans for nearly as long as it has existed.
During Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, he pushed for it to be dismantled.
Republicans have historically pushed against centralising education policy, believing that it is best left up to individual states and localities.
More recently they have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as "woke" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race.
Trump's allies also want to expand school choice, which would allow students and families to use public money to select private or religious alternatives to public schools.
Conservatives argue that other education department functions, such as administering loans, should be handled instead by the US Department of Treasury, and that civil rights infractions are the Department of Justice's domain.

Headline: Three heli-skiers feared dead in Alaska mountain avalanche

Text: Three men are feared dead after being hit by a massive avalanche while on a backcountry heli-skiing trip in the US state of Alaska, say officials.
Officials believe the party is buried in up to 100ft (30m) of snow, but no bodies have yet been recovered after Tuesday afternoon's incident in the Chugach mountains about 40 miles (65km) east of Anchorage.
The skiers, who have not yet been identified, were flown in by helicopter as part of a commercially guided trip, according to Alaska State Troopers. A fourth person in the group reportedly escaped the disaster.
If the deaths are confirmed, this would be the deadliest US avalanche since three climbers died in Washington state's Cascade mountains in 2023.
"We are sorry to report an avalanche resulting in multiple fatalities in the west fork of the Twentymile River yesterday afternoon," the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Information Center said on Wednesday.
"Details on this accident are still emerging, and we will share more information as it becomes available. Our sincere condolences go out to the friends and families of those involved."
Alaska State Troopers said the skiers had all come from other states to the mountain near Girdwood, close to Alaska's largest resort, Alyeska.
A spokeswoman for Chugach Powder Guides, which took the men on the excursion, told the Anchorage Daily News that witnesses had seen all three deploy their avalanche airbags, devices that inflate to help skiers stay on the surface of a snowslide.
The avalanche is estimated to have been about half a mile long, sliding about 2,000ft down the peak.
Using beacons, which transmit a radio signal to rescuers in the event of an avalanche burial, guides were able to locate "a probable area where skiers were buried between 40ft and nearly 100ft deep".
"The guides were unable to recover the three skiers due to the depth," the statement says.
The rescue was called off due to limited daylight and because storms were expected to bring more snow and wind, heightening the risk of another avalanche.
Each winter, between 25 and 30 people die in avalanches in the US, says the National Avalanche Center.

Text: Republicans will move forward with their vote to punish the Texas Democrat who was ejected from Congress for disrupting President Donald Trump's chamber address on Tuesday.
Congressman Al Green's fellow Democrats attempted to block the vote to censure the 77-year-old, with some arguing his decision to stand, wave his cane and heckle Trump was a legitimate act of protest.
All Democrats voted to table the censure vote, but their motion failed to overcome Republicans' thin majority - 209-211-1. Green voted present.
Even when facing punishment in the House, Green said his protest was "worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up" to Trump.
Republican congressman Dan Newhouse of Washington introduced a resolution on Wednesday to censure Green, which would mean a formal reprimand for breaching chamber decorum. A vote is expected in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the behaviour of Green and other Democrats who also jeered at the president "completely disgraceful".
But Green's actions were greeted by some on the left as a welcome sign that Democratic lawmakers were willing to fight Trump after the party's resounding election defeat in November.
"When security searched [Green], they found that he smuggled a spine," anti-racism activist and author Ibram X Kendi posted on Instagram to his over one million followers.
But Green's behaviour also seemed to illustrate Democrats' uneven response to the Trump administration, which has frustrated many of its supporters as the president moves quickly to enact his agenda.
Since re-entering the Oval Office, the president has signed dozens of executive orders, moved to fire thousands of federal employees, and banned diversity, equity and inclusion programmes from the government.
The frenzy of activity has dismayed many Democratic voters, 65% of whom said the party's congressional lawmakers should oppose Trump "as much as possible", according to a February poll by the BBC's partner CBS News and YouGov.
Hours before Trump's address on Tuesday, members of the Congressional Black Caucus held a packed news conference in a tiny room on Capitol Hill to discuss how to oppose the White House.
Another Texas congressman, Sylvester Turner, who died on Wednesday morning after a medical emergency, was one of those crammed inside, where sleeves were rolled up and expletives unleashed.
Though he was not present at the meeting, Green is also a CBC member.
"We recognise that this is an unprecedented moment," Rep Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California said.
"These are not normal times, and the black caucus is not interested in being predictable or polite in this moment," she added.
Rep Troy Carter of Louisiana said: "We will work tirelessly, and we will push back in every possible way."
Part of the opposition effort, Carter said, includes more than 100 lawsuits filed against the administration and its new policies.
Members of the CBC also cited protests they have staged outside federal buildings, risking arrest.
"We aren't going to let them just do whatever they want," Carter said.
CBC members conceded that despite the caucus' size - 60 total, representing nearly 30% of sitting House Democrats - their effectiveness is limited without a House majority.
"We can be mad, we can cuss - we're three votes down. That's the reality," said Rep Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri.
Part of an evolving strategy to resist the Trump administration must come from everyday people on the ground, CBC members agreed.
It is a mandate that members said required reaching voters in new, even if eyebrow-raising, ways on social media.
"We are going to engage in the podcasts," Rep Jasmine Crockett, of Texas said, "we are going to engage and release our own social media, trying to grow it."

Text: An alleged thief in Florida swallowed stolen earrings worth more than half a million dollars moments before police took him into custody last week.
Orlando police have accused the man, 32-year-old Jaythan Gilder, of lying to Tiffany & Co. employees in a Florida store by telling them he represented "a professional athlete", which led employees to show him "several high-value pieces".
Mr Gilder then allegedly stole the earrings and ran out of the store.
When officers caught up with him later that day, they saw Mr Gilder "swallowing several objects believed to be the stolen earrings," police said.
Mr Gilder allegedly attempted to steal two pairs of earrings worth $769,500 (£597,000), as well as a diamond ring that he supposedly dropped as he fled the store.
Police later released an x-ray that appeared to show an individual's abdomen with a foreign object inside.
When asked by the BBC, Orlando Police did not say whether they had retrieved the jewellery.
Police also said Mr Gilder has stolen from Tiffany & Co before, robbing a Texas store in 2022.
There are 48 separate warrants out for his arrest in nearby Colorado, as well.
Police charged Mr Gilder with robbery with a mask and grand theft in the first degree, involving stolen goods valued at more than $100,000. He is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court.

Headline: US top court rejects Trump bid to withhold $2bn in foreign aid

Text: The US Supreme Court has rejected a request by the Trump administration to withhold nearly $2bn (£1.6bn) in payments to foreign aid organisations for work they have already performed for the government.
On Wednesday, the top court upheld a lower court ruling ordering the administration to release the funds to contractors and grant recipients of the US Agency for International Development and the State Department.
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has cut numerous aid programmes and placed most USAID staff on leave or dismissed them.
Aid agencies argue these actions have jeopardised life-saving operations worldwide.
Last month District Judge Amir Ali had ordered the State Department and USAID to pay the bills to contractors for the work already done by midnight on 26 February.
As the deadline approached, the Trump administration sought an emergency relief from the Supreme Court, arguing it was impossible to process claims in an orderly fashion in such a short period of time.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a brief administrative stay, before the full court acted on President Trump's request.
On Wednesday, the top court in a narrow 5-4 decision declined to halt the lower court order that required the Trump administration to release the payment.
The court said that Judge Ali's deadline for the immediate payment had now passed, and the district court should "clarify what obligations" the administration must fulfil to comply the order.
Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented with the order.
"Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?" Justice Alito wrote in a dissent joined by the three other conservative justices. "The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned."
The case began when two aid groups challenged Trump's 90-day freeze on foreign assistance. Judge Ali initially paused the cuts while reviewing the case, later ordering payment for completed work after the government failed to comply.
Legal proceedings continue, with a district court hearing set for Thursday on contractors' requests for extended relief.
The Trump administration, led by billionaire Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative, aims to shrink the federal workforce.
USAID cutbacks have already disrupted global aid efforts, freezing hundreds of programmes in dozens of countries.
The US, by far the world's largest humanitarian aid provider, operates in over 60 countries, largely through contractors.

Text: Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has told the BBC she takes US President Donald Trump's remarks on making Canada the 51st state of his country "very seriously".
"This is not a joke anymore," Joly told Newsnight. "There's a reason why Canadians, when they go out on a hockey game, are booing the American national anthem... We're insulted. We're mad. We're angry."
Her comments come after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada on Tuesday. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called that a "very dumb thing to do" and announced retaliatory tariffs.
However, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump would "probably" announce a deal to reduce tariffs on Wednesday.
In response, Joly told the BBC that "at the end of the day, the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump".
She said no Trump administration secretaries had contacted their Canadian counterparts on Monday or Tuesday about tariffs.
Trump and Trudeau, however, are expected to speak over the phone on Wednesday morning, according to sources who spoke to CNN and the Toronto Star.
Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on 4 February, but delayed implementation until 4 March. Canadian energy imports face a 10% tariff.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford implemented a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states, and if tariffs escalated, said he would consider cutting Michigan, New York and Minnesota off from Canadian power.
Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on goods worth more than $800 (£645) from China in February, which doubled in March. China responded with its own tariffs.
The White House said when it introduced the tariffs that it was "taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country".
Fentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year.
Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US.
Canada had introduced new border security measures in December, in response to Trump's tariff threats before he took office.
"We didn't want this trade war. We did everything that was required under the executive order to make sure our border was safe and secure," Joly told the BBC, but said "this is a bogus excuse on the part of the Trump administration against us".
Joly said Canada was the "canary in the coal mine", with the Europeans next, and the UK after that. Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on the European Union as well.
She said Canada and the UK should work together: "That's also why I went to London to make sure that if there are tariffs imposed, we should work on counter-tariffs well."
Joly said Canada's public displays of displeasure against the US are not "against the American people. We're the best friends of the American people".
She called the tariffs on the US's biggest trading partner an "existential threat".
"We cannot let our guard down," she said. "We need to make sure that we fight back."

Headline: Fact-checking Trump's address to Congress

Text: In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.
He returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called "appalling waste" in government spending.
BBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims.
Trump said he inherited an "economic catastrophe" from Biden.
This is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.
On rising prices, Trump added "we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country".
Inflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.
The 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.
Inflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.
Trump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he "let the price of eggs get out of control".
Prices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.
Egg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.
The USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (£780m) plan to help combat the issue.
The outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it.
The Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.
Trump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found "hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud" in federal government spending.
No evidence has been provided for this figure.
On its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.
However, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published "receipts" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.
US media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.
Speaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that "as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded".
This is true.
In February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.
This is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.
By comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden.
Numbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.
Continuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: "Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States".
There is no evidence for a figure this high.
Encounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.
It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.
A report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.
It says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.
On US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: "We've spent perhaps $350bn… and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is."
BBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.
The US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.
It calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn.
The US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure.
We have asked the White House where it comes from.
Correction: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.

Headline: Young Republicans cheer Trump on from Texas watch party
Author: Samantha Granville, BBC News, Reporting fromHouston, Texas
Published Date: 2025-03-05T08:59:22.758Z
Text: It's the first night of the Rodeo in Houston, Texas - usually an unmissable event in the city.
But gathered at an Irish pub in the suburbs of the city are a group of young Republicans who don't want to miss US President Donald Trump's prime-time address to Congress.
About a dozen members of the party have piled into the back room of the pub while Fox News blares on surrounding TV screens.
People have come out wearing red, white and blue, with flag pins and scarves to accessorise.
Before the speech started, members of the club told me how excited they were to hear Trump's policy proposals.
If they had to give him a grade on the first 44 days in office, it was a unanimous "A+".
"He's already surpassed all expectations," one person told me.
As the president took to the podium, the group chatter stopped, but the cheering and laughing did not.
Sporting a Trump-Vance baseball cap, Evan Howard, 26, raised his glass every time the President said something he agreed with. And that was a lot.
"He's going to crack down on crime and be tough with cartels. He'll stop a lot of American bloodshed," he said.
But Evan conceded that, 44 days in, he's not feeling the benefit of President Trump being back in office. At least, not yet, and he's happy to wait.
"I'm not too much better off, to be honest, but I like what he's doing," Evan said. "I see the work that's being done, and I understand that some of these changes that he's putting through are not going to go through right away, and that we will see their effects in the future."
Seated across from Evan was Brittany, who was far less expressive throughout the event than the rest of the table. A 31-year-old black woman, she's new to the Republican Party.
"I think he did great. I thought it was a very unifying message," she said. "He pointed out a lot of things that the Democrats, who I used to feel really connected to at one point, have failed to press on.
"[The Democrats] tend to advocate for certain things that don't really apply to Americans as a whole. Americans are struggling. You have issues with crime, you have people losing their home, you have people becoming homeless. And the liberals want to talk about pronouns."
Mentions of pronouns, gender, and "wokeness" garnered a lot of cheers and claps from the crowd on Tuesday night.
The boos came every time the cameras panned to Nancy Pelosi, or Democrats holding signs in the crowd, or any lawmaker looking sleepy in the crowd.
In her solemn rebuttal speech to Congress, Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin warned US democracy was "at risk".
"It's at risk when the president decides you can pick and choose what rules you want to follow, when he ignores court orders and the constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand by and just let it happen," she said.
She also took aim at the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who she said was combing through Americans' private information with a "gang of 20-year-olds" from his White House team known as Doge.
But Slotkin's remarks appear to have had little effect on the Republicans gathered in the Texas bar.
The only feedback for Trump tonight? Maybe talk about Joe Biden a little less.
But otherwise, the parting message from this group is: promises made and promises kept.

Headline: Who is Elissa Slotkin, the Democrat who responded to Trump's speech?
Author: Madeline Halpert and Brandon Drenon, BBC News

Text: Elissa Slotkin, a US Senate Democrat, gave her party's response to Trump's congressional address, taking the new Trump administration to task for bringing with it chaos and recklessness.
Early in her remarks, she attacked the White House on the economy and warned that if Trump was "not careful, he could walk us right into a recession".
Slotkin also took a shot at the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting project led by Elon Musk, saying change is needed "but doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe".
Speaking from Michigan before a backdrop of US flags, Slotkin was much more concise and much less animated than the president, who regaled Republicans on the House floor for an hour and 40 minutes.
She made a quick reference to Democrats' stinging election defeat in November, but then quickly pivoted to Trump.
"Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change," she said.
"But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy."
Throughout the election, voters frequently said the economy was their number one concern, and Democrats' defeat was blamed on not addressing it sufficiently.
Weeks into Trump's presidency, economic concerns remain high, as prices of a number of goods have not dropped, and prices on some items, like eggs, have risen.
"Grocery and home prices are going up, not down – and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either," she said.
Slotkin also talked about immigration, another topic where Democrats poll worse than Republicans, highlighting a lack of empathy by the Trump administration toward undocumented immigrants.
"The border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants," she said.
She cited the public berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday during a meeting withTrump and Vice-President JD Vance, too.
"That scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world," she said.
"He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth."
For many, Tuesday night was their first time meeting Slotkin, who won the US Senate seat in the swing state of Michigan last year.
A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst, Slotkin became the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate at 48, when she won her seat in a state that former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost last November.
Slotkin gave her speech after Trump's, which is not a traditional State of the Union address but was expected to serve the same purpose.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Slotkin a "rising star" in the party last week as he announced her as the pick to provide the Democratic Party's rebuttal. He said she was "great on both economic and national security" topics.
Slotkin is new to the Senate, but she served in Congress as a member of Michigan's delegation to the House of Representatives. She was first elected in the Democrats' 2018 wave of success, flipping a Republican seat.
Prior to her political career, she held a variety of government jobs. She held national security positions in Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama's administrations.
She served in Bush's National Security Council, and, under Obama, she served as acting assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs and in the State Department.
The CIA recruited Slotkin, who is fluent in Arabic and Swahili, shortly after she earned a graduate degree in international affairs at Columbia University in New York City. She served three tours in Iraq as a CIA analyst.
The moderate Democrat focused her 2024 Senate campaign on lowering costs for Americans, a move that helped propel her to a narrow victory over former Congressman Mike Rogers, even as Trump won the state.
Slotkin is a member of the committees on Armed Forces; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; and Veterans Affairs.

Headline: Trump says he is 'just getting started' in speech to US Congress
Author: Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent•@awzurcher, •

Text: Six weeks into his presidency, Donald Trump came to a US Capitol controlled by his Republican Party to take a lengthy victory lap.
"We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started," he told the joint session of Congress.
In typical Trumpian hyperbole, he said that "many" believed his to be the most successful start to a presidency in US history. He noted what he said was a change in the national mood toward "pride" and "confidence". He compared himself to George Washington, and boasted about the size of his electoral victory.
The whirlwind start to his presidency offered plenty of material for Trump to cover, and he didn't shy away from it.
He ticked through a lengthy list of tangible accomplishments – hundreds of executive orders and actions, a freeze on foreign aid, lower levels of illegal border crossing, and the withdrawal from international organisations and agreements.
He also spoke at length about his ban on transgender athletes in women's sports and moves to get "woke ideology" out of US schools and the military.
"Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone, it's gone, and we feel so much better for it, don't we?"
Meanwhile, Democrats – who filled up half the audience in the House chamber – sat in icy silence, as the president repeatedly blamed them, former President Joe Biden and "radical left lunatics" for all the nation's ills.
Several dozen responded by holding up small black signs with words like "false" and "lies".
The president seemed to enjoy putting the "bully" in the presidential bully pulpit.
He needled his political adversaries, mocking their refusal to cheer his remarks, dusting off his "Pocahontas" nickname for Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, and wryly noting that attempts to prosecute him "didn't work out" for his opponents.
Texas congressman Al Green was not around to see any of that, however.
At the very start of Trump's speech, the Democrat had harangued the president, his mostly inaudible comments punctuated with repeated thrusts of his cane. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson called for decorum and the House Sergeant-at-Arms escorted the congressman from the chamber.
Green would tell reporters outside the Capitol that he was protesting proposed cuts to the government-run Medicaid health insurance for low-income Americans.
After about half an hour of touting his opening actions, Trump turned to the tasks he still needed to accomplish. That made up the bulk of a speech that stretched for more than an hour and 40 minutes. It was standard presidential address fare, and Trump's rhetorical flourishes began to blur together.
While he said "small business optimism" was up, he blamed Biden for the current state of the economy – including high egg prices. He promised to "rescue" the economy and make getting "dramatic and immediate relief to working families" his highest priority.
He called out Elon Musk in the audience, and said his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) would reduce inflation by cutting wasteful spending and fraud, prompting him to recite a laundry list of purported examples in foreign aid and other government programmes.
Trump leaned heavily into promises of further progress on immigration enforcement and offered an animated defence of his tariff policies, saying that they were "protecting the soul of our country", even if most economists warn they will lead to higher prices for American consumers.
The president acknowledged that adding a tax on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China might cause a "disturbance" and that US farmers might feel a "period of indigestion".
But nothing in his comments suggested that he was backing away from a budding trade war that has roiled the stock market in recent days - in fact, he promised to move forward with reciprocal tariffs on all US trade partners next month.
Trump once again promised to balance the budget, prompting a round of applause from Republican legislators. He provided no details about the kind of steep cuts such a promise would require, however.
In fact, he quickly turned to discussing the tax cuts he hopes Congress will enact – including his campaign promises of no taxes on tips, overtime or Social Security. Any of those, if enacted, would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the current nearly $2tn budget deficit.
Foreign policy is rarely front and centre in these presidential addresses, and that was the case this time despite how Trump has shaken up global politics in the first weeks of his second term.
He repeated his desire for an American annexation of Greenland, promised American control of the Panama Canal and only made brief mention of Gaza and the Middle East.
The president spoke more extensively about negotiating with Russia for peace in Ukraine. And he took pleasure in reading from a letter he said he'd just received from Volodymyr Zelensky - which was similar to a message the Ukrainian leader posted on X earlier in the day.
"He said: 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence.'
Trump added that Zelensky had said he was ready to sign an agreement on minerals and security "at any time that is convenient for you".
"I appreciate that," Trump told the chamber, offering a hint of a possible cooling of the acrimony between the two leaders.
By the time Trump wrapped up and Democrats practically sprinted for the exits, his speech had set a modern record for the longest presidential address to Congress. Much like the first six weeks of Trump's presidency, there was plenty for his supporters to love, and lots for his critics – at least those who tuned in – to jeer.

Headline: Democrat Al Green ejected from chamber for heckling Trump

Text: Representative Al Green was ejected from the House chamber for heckling President Donald Trump during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night.
Green, a Democratic lawmaker from Houston in Texas, stood up and shouted 'Mr President, you don't have a mandate!' just minutes into Trump's address, referring to Medicaid cuts.
He was immediately drowned out by Republicans shouting "U-S-A!," before House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered his removal from the chamber.
Green is a fierce critic of President Trump, and called for the impeachment of the president during his first term in office.
Speaking to reporters after he left the chamber, Green said he is willing to accept whatever punishment he is given for his actions.
He doubled down on his message, saying Trump "has no mandate to cut Medicaid", and that he is preparing articles to impeach the president.
"This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for [the] poor," he said.
Medicaid is the programme that helps cover medical costs for those with limited income and resources. It has become one of the biggest issues for Democrats concerned that about reductions to the programme.
Trump has said Medicaid won't be affected, but achieving the widespread cuts Republicans promise could be difficult without cutting major social services.
Several prominent Democrats such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer invited Medicaid beneficiaries as guests to the joint address.
New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went on Instagram Live after Trump's address, warning that Trump and the Republicans "are coming for Medicaid".
Green was not the only Democrat who protested in the chamber.
Several Democratic women were seen wearing pink dresses in protest of President Trump's policies, saying that rising costs are disproportionately affecting women.
Others were seen wearing yellow and blue ties, to show their support for Ukraine, representing the colours of the country's flag.
Trump said Monday that he is pausing all military aid to Ukraine, a few days after his spat with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.
The Democrats largely remained seated and quiet throughout Trump's address, but some flashed placards with the word 'false' on them in response to some of the president's claims.
This is in contrast to Republican lawmakers, who loudly applauded throughout Trump's speech and occasionally burst into 'U-S-A' chants during his speech.

Headline: Officers charged in 'gladiator fights' at California youth detention centre

Published Date: 2025-03-05T01:18:21.139Z
Text: Thirty officers have been charged in connection with 'gladiator fights' they sometimes 'encouraged' inside a California youth detention centre, the state's attorney general said.
Charges against them include child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery, attorney general Rob Bonta's office announced in a press release on Monday.
Officials tallied 69 fights at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, California, from July to December 2023.
An investigation into the brawls began after footage from one of the fights was leaked, leading officials to find 143 victims involved, ranging from 12 to 18 years old.
Twenty-two of the 30 officers charged were arraigned on Monday, meaning they formally faced their charges in court.
The other eight officers are scheduled to be arraigned in April.
"Officers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care," Mr Bonta said in the press release.
Instead, he continued, the officers charged were "overseeing 'gladiator fights' when they should have intervened".
The fights at the youth centre resulted in physical harm to the teens, according to the press release.
The leaked video footage - published by the Los Angeles Times in April - shows a teen falling to the ground after sustaining punches and kicks from multiple others.
The video shows officers inside standing nearby and watching, and they appear to occasionally laugh and shake hands with the assailants as the fights continue.
"Watching the video, the officers look more like referees or audience members at a prizefight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people," Mr Bonta said at a press conference on Monday.
"The officers don't step in, don't intervene and don't protect their charges."
The LA County Probation Department, which runs Los Padrinos, said in a statement that it "fully supports and applauds" the attorney general's office for the indictments.
The department also said that all officers involved are on leave without pay.
"Our department sought the assistance of law enforcement authorities when misconduct was discovered," the statement said.
"Since then, we have fully collaborated with our law enforcement partners.
At least two of the teens involved have retained a lawyer with plans to sue the county, according to the New York Times.
One of the two teens was seen being attacked in the video footage, aged 16 at the time, said the teen's lawyer, Jamal Tooson.
Mr Tooson said the other teen he represents was attacked three times in one day at the facility, leaving the client unconscious and with traumatic brain injury.

Headline: Trudeau hits out at 'dumb' tariffs as Trump warns of further hikes against Canada
Author: Nadine Yousif, Brandon Drenon and James FitzGerald, BBC News, Toronto, Washington DC and London

Text: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a "very dumb thing to do" and vowed to conduct a "relentless fight" to protect its economy.
Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.
The Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.
But Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: "Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!"
Trudeau accused the US president of planning "a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us".
"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state," he told reporters on Tuesday.
"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners."
He said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they "don't last a second longer than necessary".
Trump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.
Responding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was "no justification" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada.
Trudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was "no motive, no reason, no justification" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own "tariff and non-tariff measures" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.
Trump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.
The items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.
"Prices could go up pretty soon", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly.
"We are in pretty uncharted territory," he told the BBC.
The bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.
"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour," he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, "everybody is a loser".
The three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war.
"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality," Prof Rogers said.
Tariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.
Canada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; £84bn) of American goods:
Canada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.
"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt," he said on Monday.
Speaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed "pretty scared" of being laid off. "I just bought my first house," Joel Soleski said. "I might have to look for work elsewhere."
The sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will "shut down on both sides of the border" as a result of the tariffs.
The tariffs were called "reckless" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards "recession, job losses and economic disaster".
Ms Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said "are less reliable than Canadian ones".
Canadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses.
Ford of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.
Canada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.
Ontario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario.
Ford also announced that a C$100m ($68m; £55.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.
Meanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the "bitter end". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.

Headline: Trump to deliver 'big' televised speech to US Congress
Author: Nadine Yousif, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-04T20:31:44.756Z
Text: US President Donald Trump will deliver a speech to Congress on Tuesday evening, in which he is expected to discuss new US trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine.
The speech, scheduled for 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT), will be Trump's first major address since his return to the White House, although it is not an official State of the Union talk.
Its theme will be the "Renewal of the American Dream", Fox News reports, and it will have four sections: Trump's accomplishments, the economy, funding for border security and Trump's plans for global peace.
It comes after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting a fall in stock markets, while pausing all US aid to Ukraine.
Trump teased the speech in a post on his Truth Social network on Monday, writing: "TOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BIG. I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS."
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said it would be "must-see TV".
She told Fox News that the address "will celebrate his extraordinarily successful first month in office while outlining his bold, ambitious and common sense vision for the future".
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has drastically upended US policy on key foreign policy and trade issues.
He has also created a Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), fronted by tech titan Elon Musk, to dramatically shrink the size of the federal government in a bid to cut costs and balance the books. Doge has since instructed controversial mass layoffs in the federal workforce across departments.
Democratic lawmakers have invited several workers who were fired as a result of Doge cuts to Tuesday's address.
Among them are a disabled veteran who was recently fired from her position at a veterans affairs office, a National Park Service ranger and Kyle Rahn, a disabled army veteran who was recently let go from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
Democrats were also planning to invite several people who received life-saving treatment through Medicaid, the US government-funded health insurance programme for those on low incomes.
The White House said First Lady Melania Trump would be joined by several guests at the speech.
They include a teenager from Texas who was the victim of computer-generated deepfake videos; the widow and daughters of Corey Comperatore, the Pennsylvania firefighter who was killed by the gunman who shot President Trump in July 2024; and the mother and sister of Laken Riley, the nursing student whose murder inspired a law requiring the detention of illegal immigrants charged with certain crimes.
Also on the Trump guest list are community volunteers, a former high school athlete who campaigns against transgender women playing in female sports competitions, and Marc Fogel, a teacher who attempted to enter Russia with medical cannabis and was sentenced to 14 years in prison but was released in a prisoner exchange in February.
Trump's speech will be followed by a rebuttal from Democrats, which will be delivered by newly-elected Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said Slotkin would "offer a bold vision of hope, unity, and a brighter future for everyone, not just the wealthy few at the top".
While Tuesday's speech appears to be like a traditional State of the Union (SOTU) address, it is expected to be slightly different.
SOTU addresses are typically given by the president annually in late January or early February, and serve as an update on events of the previous year as well as future agendas.
Tuesday's remarks, however, are what is called a joint address to Congress - a formal speech to all US lawmakers that a president could deliver at any time to discuss matters of national importance.
The practice of calling for a joint address to Congress at the beginning of a presidential term was pioneered by Ronald Reagan, and has been carried out by every US president since.

Headline: JD Vance: The 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist who became vice-president
Author: Mike Wendling, BBC News•@mwendling, •, Reporting fromMilwaukee, Wisconsin
Published Date: 2025-03-04T20:25:36.863Z
Text: US Vice-President JD Vance is no stranger to transformation.
Vance grew up in poverty, but went on to Yale Law School and rubbed shoulders with Silicon Valley elites before turning his life story into a politically tinged memoir which championed conservative values.
He is a former US Marine who served in Iraq as a military journalist before becoming a sharp critic of American involvement overseas.
And having once said he was a "never-Trump guy", he took office as Trump's deputy - and a steadfast Maga (Make America Great Again) loyalist.
His current job also makes him the early frontrunner in the 2028 presidential race, when Trump will no longer be able to run under rules set out in the US Constitution.
Trump, 78, is the oldest person ever to be sworn in as US president, and 40-year-old Vance is - as an old phrase goes - just a heartbeat away from the top job.
But now the former Ohio Senator and self-described "hillbilly" faces perhaps his biggest test - keeping in with Trump and forging a role in the administration when Elon Musk has sucked up much more attention than the president's elected second-in-command.
The pitfalls are obvious. The last Republican Vice-President, Mike Pence, dared to stand up to Trump by refusing to overturn the duo's 2020 election loss.
Pence's subsequent bid to run for president crashed and burned, and he is now persona non grata in the Maga world.
Vance will hope to avoid the same fate. And his recent lecturing of US allies - including a fiery confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office - point to a possible role he may fill as vice-president, that of an aggressive champion of "America first" foreign policy.
Vance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler.
He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in Hillbilly Elegy, published in 2016.
A revolving cast of father figures - he changed his surname several times - and his mother's drug abuse issues resulted in a chaotic childhood, and he found refuge in Mamaw's house.
When he married, both JD and his wife Usha took the last name of Vance to honour his maternal grandparents' family name - leading to his current name: James David Vance.
Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, but Vance identified closely with his extended family’s roots to the south.
Appalachia is a vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest and north-east. Largely but not exclusively white, it includes some of the country’s poorest areas, where jobs are scarce and drugs and violence are abundant.
In Hillbilly Elegy, Vance painted a personal portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of family members, neighbours and friends. While criticising outsiders for looking down on the "hillbillies" of the book's title, he took a distinctly conservative view, describing his own people as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on government welfare payments and mostly failing to work hard and pull themselves up by their tattered bootstraps.
He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”.
“The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.”
By the time the book came out - with near-perfect timing in the thick of the 2016 presidential race - Vance’s own bootstrap-tugging had slung him far away from Middletown. His stint in the US Marines including a tour of duty in Iraq was followed by college at Ohio State University and Yale Law School, then a job as a venture capitalist in California.
Hillbilly Elegy not only made him into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white, working-class voters.
His verdict on Trump was damning - and definitive. Some quotes from the time:
“I’m a 'never Trump' guy. I never liked him.”
“My god what an idiot.”
“I find him reprehensible.”
As he promoted his book, and along with it a mix of sympathy for the working class and conservative values, Vance rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee.
“I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class," he told an interviewer in October 2016.
"What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.”
Ironically, those are exactly some of the themes that he himself would go on to regularly raise eight years later, as Trump's running mate.
Vance and his wife Usha, who he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.
Usha Vance had a posher upbringing than her husband, growing up in a suburb of San Diego as the child of Indian immigrant academics. In addition to her Yale history and law degrees, she has a master's from the UK's University of Cambridge.
She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and most recently worked for Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that a leading legal journal described as "progressive" and "woke". Mrs Vance resigned from her job shortly after her husband was selected by Trump to be the VP nominee.
In 2017, in the early years of the first Trump term, Vance and his family returned to Ohio after several years of living on the US coasts.
At the same time, whispers about Vance's possible foray into politics - bolstered by his newfound fame - grew. And several years later, Vance saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican Senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022.
Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, it got a kick-start via a $10m (£7.7m) donation from his former boss, Silicon Valley powerbroker Peter Thiel.
His rhetoric shifted, and he spent less time talking about the failures of hillbillies and more about those of elites, the "woke" and Democrats. He began appearing on Fox News, but to drum up support, he also popped up on fringier political outlets - including the right-wing Newsmax network and niche podcasts and YouTube channels.
Many of the controversial clips which would later resurface during the 2024 presidential campaign date from around the time his Senate campaign was starting to gain traction.
At one point he told then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the United States was being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too." Vance later called his remark "dumb" but said he was trying to make the point that "our country has become almost pathologically anti-child".
However the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected to the Senate was his past criticism of Trump.
Vance remained a Trump sceptic as late as 2020, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post. Then, he wrote that the president had "thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism (excepting a disjointed China policy)". And he correctly predicted that Trump would lose the presidency - although he would later endorse false claims that Trump actually beat Joe Biden.
Eventually, though, he found himself on a path back to Maga. During the 2022 Senate campaign, Vance apologised for his previous public criticism of Trump and earned an endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate.
During his short tenure in the Senate, Vance was a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine - a role he would continue to play in the second Trump administration.
Democrats were in the majority during his time in Congress, muffling any impact that a freshman Republican senator might hope to have, however Vance proposed legislation to withhold federal funds from colleges that allow protests against Israel's war in Gaza or employ undocumented immigrants.
At a speech in July 2024 at the National Conservatism Conference, an increasingly influential gathering of right-wing and far-right leaders from around the world, he argued that American involvement in Ukraine had "no obvious conclusion or even objective that we’re close to getting accomplished".
At the same conference, he said the UK was "not doing so good" because of immigration and claimed that under a Labour government, the country would become the “first truly Islamist country” with a nuclear bomb.
Just days later, during the Republican National Convention, Trump tapped Vance for the VP nomination.
He received a rapturous welcome when he entered the venue in Milwaukee, appearing slightly in awe as he was greeted by the party faithful.
Once out on the campaign trail, he established himself as an attack dog, relentlessly criticising the opposition and engaging with reporters in combative Q&A sessions at rallies and on cable TV shows.
He continued to attract controversy, spreading baseless rumours about Haitian immigrants eating pets, which caused huge upheaval in Springfield, a city not far from Vance's hometown in Ohio.
During a CNN interview, Vance explained that he felt the need to "create stories so that the... media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people”.
He insisted that constituents had told him stories of pet-eating by immigrants, even though he did not elaborate and his Senate office did not respond to the BBC's requests for details.
He also shifted his views on abortion policy. A Catholic convert, Vance had at one time expressed support for a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. He later backed Trump's view that the matter should be left up to individual states to decide.
During the whirlwind first weeks of Trump's second term, Vance gave staunch backing for his boss's plans to reshape and scale back government - and questioned the authority of US judges to stand in the way.
But Vance was often overshadowed by Trump's cost-cutting tsar Elon Musk and his attempts to take a wrecking ball to multiple government departments.
The vice-president has had more of an impact on foreign policy. He made his debut on the world stage with a trip to Europe, during which he berated US allies at the Munich Security Conference. Vance accused European leaders of censoring free speech, taking in too many immigrants and undermining democracy.
Then in late February came the argument in the Oval Office, during a meeting that went off the rails after Vance interjected to praise Trump's diplomacy and slam the previous Democratic administration.
Zelensky replied by outlining the recent decade including repeated Russian violations of ceasefire agreements and pointedly asked the vice-president: "What kind of diplomacy, JD, [are] you are speaking about?"
The conversation devolved from there, with Vance accusing Zelensky of disrespect.
"Have you said thank you once?" Vance demanded, as the Ukrainian president pointed out that he had thanked Americans on numerous occasions.
It was a return to Vance's loyal attack-dog style seen on the campaign trail.
As for the future, Trump was asked in a February interview broadcast before the Super Bowl if he viewed Vance as his successor.
"No," Trump said, before explaining that at this stage, the Republican 2028 field is still wide open. "But he's very capable… it's too early, we're just starting."
The reward for Vance's loyalty could be huge. But the vice-presidency is no sure ticket to the top job. Just ask Kamala Harris – or Mike Pence.

Headline: Trump vows to deport students over 'illegal protests'

Text: US President Donald Trump said he would cut funding for universities that allow what he called "illegal" protests and prosecute and deport foreign students who participate.
On his Truth Social social media platform, Trump said that "all federal funding will STOP" for schools that permit students to protest illegally.
Trump's announcement comes less than a year after massive student protests against Israel's war in Gaza swept across US college campuses, including Columbia University in New York and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
American students will be expelled, Trump said.
Trump did not specify what would constitute an "illegal" protest. Broadly speaking, the right to protest is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution.
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as Fire, swiftly condemned Trump's announcement.
"Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow 'illegal' protests," the statement said.
The group added that the move will "cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict".
In a separate announcement, the US Department of Education, General Services Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services said they would conduct a "comprehensive review" of Columbia's federal contracts amid an ongoing investigation into compliance with Title VI, a federal law that bans discrimination based on ethnicity or ancestry.
In a statement, the education department said that it is considering stop work orders for $51.4m (£40.19m) in contracts with the New York City-based university, and will review more than $5bn in grant commitments to the school.
"Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses - repeatedly overrun by antisemitic students and agitators," Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement.
McMahon added that "unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralysed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled".
In January, Trump signed an executive order that called for the removal of foreign students who participated in protests.
The order also directed government departments to make recommendations that could allow educational institutions to "monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff" and, if warranted, remove them.
A White House fact sheet on the order specified that it seeks to "protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities".
In April 2024, student protests against the war in Gaza drew national attention after students at Columbia were arrested at a student encampment set up on campus.
Thousands of arrests were ultimately made at dozens of universities across the country.
At Columbia, the university authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building.
Four months after protests rocked the campus, Columbia president Minouche Shafik resigned.
Earlier this week, a federal task force announced it would visit 10 prominent US universities that have been the scene of anti-semitic incidents.

Headline: Ontario's Doug Ford says he could cut electricity to US over tariffs

Text: Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he's willing to cut off power supply to the US if President Donald Trump continues with tariffs against Canada.
Ford announced his retaliatory plans shortly after Trump implemented a 25% tariff against Canadian imported goods and a 10% tariff on Canadian energy.
He said he would implement his own 25% surcharge on Canadian electricity exports to three US states: Michigan, New York and Minnesota.
If the US tariffs are escalated, he said, he would consider completely cutting those states off from Canadian power.
About 1.5m Americans in those states get their electricity from Canada.
Ford's response comes after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his own retaliatory measures – including an immediate 25% tariff on C$30bn ($20.7, £16.2) of goods from the US.
As the leader of Ontario, Canada's most populous province and largest economy, Ford is able to wield his own carrot and stick.
He banned US companies from bidding on Ontario infrastructure projects, and he cancelled a $100m deal with Elon Musk's Starlink internet provider.
He also said he's reached out to lawmakers in those three US states to urge them to put pressure on Trump to back off tariffs against Canada - or risk leaving their own constituents in the dark.
He also urged premiers in other Canadian provinces to follow suit.
But the timing of Ford's promised tariffs is not clear.
Ford told media he would implement the tariff on electricity if Trump's tariffs "persist".
He said he is looking for ways to avoid passing new legislation, which could take weeks.
"We need to act immediately," he said.
"If they go further into April, then we'll cut off their electricity," he added.

Headline: Jay-Z sues woman who dropped rape claim against him
Author: Samantha Granville, BBC News, Los Angeles
Published Date: 2025-03-04T18:50:45.255Z
Text: Jay-Z is suing a woman who in February withdrew her legal action accusing the rapper of rape.
His defamation action claims she "voluntarily admitted" being pressured into making false claims in what it describes as an "evil conspiracy" to extort money and damage his reputation.
The anonymous woman filed her legal action in October and refiled it in December, accusing Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, and Sean "Diddy" Combs of raping her aged 13, after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.
Both rappers denied the allegations.
Jay-Z's defamation action, filed at a federal court in Alabama, also accuses the woman's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, and his co-counsel, David Fortney, of orchestrating her lawsuit.
Mr Buzbee has garnered headlines internationally over the dozens of legal actions he has filed on behalf of people accusing Mr Combs of sexual misconduct, extortion, assault and other transgressions.
Mr Combs has denied all the allegations.
He is also facing federal sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty.
Jay-Z's defamation action says the woman told his legal team her lawyers had made her make the false allegations.
"Buzbee brought Jay-Z into it," it says she said.
And despite her admitting Jay-Z "did not sexually assault [her]," Mr Buzbee "pushed [her] towards going forward" with the false story to strengthen the case and extort more money, the defamation suit claims.
Jay-Z's action also notes alleged discrepancies in the woman's interview with NBC News last year, including naming another celebrity guest at the MTV party, who had, in reality, been performing in a city thousands of miles away on the night.
Her father also contradicted her claim he had picked her up after the alleged assault, it claims.
Jay-Z's defamation action says Mr Buzbee's firm failed to vet the claims and the woman, who they say has a history of mental health issues and an assault charge.
Mr Buzbee has denied any wrongdoing and claims Jay-Z's team tried to intimidate the woman into retracting her statements.
In a statement obtained by BBC News, Mr Buzbee said Jay-Z's defamation action had "no legal merit".
"Shawn Carter's investigators have repeatedly harassed, threatened and harangued this poor woman for weeks, trying to intimidate her and make her recant her story," Mr Buzbee said.
"She won't - instead, she has stated repeatedly she stands by her claims."
Jay- Z, who is married to Beyoncé, says the accusations have led to personal and professional harm, including the loss of business contracts worth about $20m (£15.8m) a year for his company, Roc Nation, and taken an emotional toll on his family, particularly his children.

Headline: Elon Musk sparks row at Royal Society but remains a member
Author: Esme Stallard, Climate and science reporter, BBC News, Victoria Gill, Science correspondent, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-04T09:44:43.364Z
Text: Members of the UK's Royal Society have urged the elite scientific academy to "step up its efforts to advocate for science and scientists" amid a row over one of its fellows - Elon Musk.
Over the last nine months, many scientists have raised concerns about the controversial billionaire's behaviour, which has been called a "threat to science".
A meeting on Monday evening did not result in Mr Musk's expulsion, but it has drawn the world's oldest scientific academy into a divisive, political row.
The campaign to revoke Mr Musk's membership centres on suggestions, from a growing number of fellows, that the billionaire's actions are "incompatible" with the society's own code of conduct.
Mr Musk has overseen unprecedented funding cuts to scientific research in the US, in his senior role in President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge).
Mr Musk has also been accused of sharing misinformation on his social media platform, X.
In a statement after the meeting, the Royal Society addressed those issues, saying that members who attended were particularly concerned about the fate of scientists in the US, "amid threats of radical cutbacks in research funding".
The society agreed to "look at potential further actions" to "counter the misinformation and ideologically motivated attacks on both science and scientists".
The BBC understands that a letter will be sent to Mr Musk from the Royal Society.
It is 250 years since a member of the Royal Society was ejected: German scientist and writer Rudolf Erich Raspe, who was accused of theft and fraud.
So the rift among the membership, caused by Mr Musk and his public pronouncements, could be a historic turning point for this most elite of scientific academies.
Two eminent scientists have resigned their fellowships in protest - Dr Dorothy Bishop of Oxford University and Prof Andrew Millar from University of Edinburgh.
More than than 3,300 scientists also put their names to a letter, written by Prof Stephen Curry, emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, who is not a fellow, that expressed "deep concern" about the billionaire's fellowship and the society's "continued silence and apparent inaction" with regard to the controversy.
Prof Curry told the BBC he was glad that the society had gathered fellows to discuss these concerns.
But, he added that he was "disappointed that they have so far given only a very short statement summarising the meeting".
"It makes no mention of the one [member] whose actions contrary to their code of conduct have prompted it".
Dr Dorothy Bishop, emeritus professor of development neuropsychology at Oxford University and the first fellow to resign over the issue, told BBC News she had complained to the Royal Society twice last year.
"On both occasions they consulted lawyers, and it may well be the case that the lawyers are concerned about the prospect of legal action," she said.
There are more than 1,700 fellows of the Royal Society and more than 60 of them have signed Prof Curry's letter. Many more have expressed their concern about Mr Musk's behaviour.
But there are many academics, researchers and Royal Society fellows who do not wish to see the divisive billionaire have his membership revoked.
Nobel prize-winner Prof Sir Andre Geim from Manchester University said: "Musk is certainly an eccentric, but his achievements beat those of any of his critics in the Royal Society. Very few can say that they achieved similar in their lives."
Other scientists who spoke to the BBC pointed out that an attempt to remove Mr Musk's fellowship could be seen as political interference and a curtailment of freedom of expression.
But Prof George Efstathiou, from the University of Cambridge, dismissed that argument.
Members, he said, "should at least have respect for the truth".
"If somebody has a disregard for the truth and says things that are blatantly false, then that speaks to their ethical standards," he added. "That's not political."
Fiona Fox is chief executive of the Science Media Centre, which works with journalists and scientists to promote "accurate, evidence-based information" in science coverage. She was elected as a Royal Society fellow in 2023.
Ms Fox told BBC News she was concerned at what was happening to the science community in the US, but questioned whether ejecting Mr Musk would achieve the Royal Society's overall aims of educating and advancing scientific research.
"There are terrifying things being done in the US - removing data sets, taking web pages down of data. This is knowledge. This is universally owned.
"There's a climate of fear in which people are self censoring. I mean, it's absolutely terrifying," she said.
Mr Musk has not responded to requests for comment that BBC News sent via his companies, Tesla and Space X.

Text: Carl Dean, the longtime husband of country music icon Dolly Parton, died on Monday at the age of 82.
Dean, who was famously private throughout his nearly 60-year marriage to Parton, died in Nashville, Tennessee, according to a statement she posted on social media.
"Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy," the statement read.
The 9-5 singer met Dean outside a laundromat on the first day she arrived in Nashville as an 18-year-old aspiring singer.
Parton, 79, recalled their first meeting, saying, "I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me). He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about."
Two years later, on May 30, 1966, the couple exchanged vows at a private ceremony in Ringgold, Georgia.
Throughout their marriage, Dean remained out of the public eye, choosing instead to focus on his asphalt-paving business in Nashville.
Though he largely stayed out of the limelight, Dean continued to influence Parton's work, most notably inspiring her classic hit Jolene.
She told US media in 2008 that the song was about a bank teller who developed a crush on Dean.
"She got this terrible crush on my husband," Parton said. "And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us—when I was saying, 'Hell, you're spending a lot of time at the bank. I don't believe we've got that kind of money.' So it's really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one."
Parton and Dean's relationship remained such a mystery that rumours started that he did not exist - but Parton joked about that.
"A lot of people say there's no Carl Dean, that he's just somebody I made up to keep other people off me," she said to the Associated Press in 1984.
Parton and Dean had no children together.
He is survived by his siblings, Sandra and Donnie, Parton's statement said.

Headline: Booze, oil and orange juice: How Canada could fight Trump tariffs

Text: Canada is expected to react forcefully and immediately to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on its products.
Trump has said he going ahead with putting a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, starting on Tuesday.
Last month Trump put on pause his plans to levy a 25% tariff on most Canadian imports, with "energy resources" only facing a 10% rate.
Now that that pause has ended, and the US is now set to steeply tax goods from one of its top trading partners, a trade war seems almost certain.
Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters later on Monday: "Let's be clear, if Trump is imposing tariffs, we're ready."
She said Ottawa planned to impose retaliatory tariffs against US imports of C$155bn ($107bn; £ 84bn), with the first tranche of $30bn ready immediately to be levied on everyday goods like pasta, clothing and perfume.
Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.
Economists suggest that such a move could have devastating immediate impacts on Canada's economy - while also leading to higher prices for Americans.
"I won't sugarcoat it - our nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks," Trudeau said in a televised address to Canadians.
Canada had worked to avoid a trade war. It has pledged more than C$1bn ($690m; £560m) to boost security at its shared border with the US - a key point of contention for Trump, who appears to be using tariffs as a negotiating tactic.
Trudeau has said in the past that all options for responding were on the table - here are four of them, and their possible impacts.
Canada has already fought one tariff "war" with Trump.
During his first term, the US president slapped 10% tariffs on Canadian aluminium products and 25% tariffs on Canadian steel, citing national security concerns.
Ottawa retaliated by imposing tariffs on select goods, which were chosen to send a political message to Trump and his allies.
It put levies on Florida orange juice, and whiskey and bourbon from Tennessee and Kentucky - the latter being the home of then-Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell.
Both countries ended up agreeing to lift the tariffs a year later.
Senior Canadian officials recently told local media that if Trump imposed tariffs again, the immediate response would likely be targeted.
According to US government data, 17% of US exports go to Canada. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the US.
Canada stands to suffer a larger economic blow in any trade war with the US and this stark imbalance is why targeted tariffs are often the first and safest approach, said Peter Clark, a lawyer who previously worked on trade policy issues in Canada's federal finance department.
By targeting select goods, Canada can hit the US without widely punishing its own citizens, as tariffs can immediately raise prices for consumers at home.
This approach is also why officials are pushing a "Buy Canadian" campaign as a way to lessen the impact of a potential retaliation.
But pundits argue that Trump is less politically vulnerable this time, given that he cannot run for a third term in the White House.
"You won't have the same impact as last time," said Julian Karaguesian, an economics lecturer at McGill University in Montreal and a former finance counsellor at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC.
Another move Canada made in its first tariff war with its neighbour was to apply dollar-for-dollar tariffs.
It slapped identical tariffs on US aluminium and steel, and ensured the total dollar value of the American goods it taxed equalled the US tariffs on Canadian exports. That came up to around C$16.6bn at the time.
This time, the possible use of dollar-for-dollar tariffs could be much larger, with Canada posting a list of $30bn of potential goods it would tax "until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canada". The list is heavy on agricultural products, but also includes inedible items like dental floss and luggage.
That could be expanded to another C$110bn worth of goods.
But the more sweeping Trump's tariffs are, the more goods Canada could tax in response.
Not all of Canada is on board with dollar-for-dollar tariffs. Scott Moe, leader of the mineral-rich province of Saskatchewan, has said that broad levies on US goods would "rip this country apart".
Mr Karaguesian said the promised US tariffs on Canadian goods could plunge the country into a recession. If Canada responded with dollar-for-dollar tariffs, it could lead to inflation.
This would result in "stagflation," he said, referring to a combination of high unemployment and rising prices.
Mr Clark said that whatever decision Canada took, politics would likely be top of mind. Polls suggest a majority of Canadians support retaliation, and that many Canadian business leaders want targeted, dollar-for-dollar tariffs.
Canadian politicians might be pushed to respond more forcefully if it means a boost in approval, Mr Clark said. "We're talking about political decisions, which are not always rational."
One of the most valuable assets in Canada's arsenal is energy.
North-eastern US states like Vermont, New York and Maine significantly rely on electricity sold to them by neighbouring Canadian provinces. British Columbia and Manitoba also supply energy to western and Midwestern regions of the US.
About 30 states receive some of their electricity from Canada, according to Canadian government data.
Canada is also the top supplier of crude oil to the US, making up 60% of total oil imports, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
Doug Ford, Ontario's premier, has suggested that Canada cut off Americans' supply to pinch Americans at the petrol pump.
"The only thing that would really sting in the immediate to short-term is if energy prices went up, because Trump himself campaigned on bringing energy prices down very quickly," said Mr Karaguesian.
But the move would be contentious, especially with the oil-rich province of Alberta - which has refused to sign off on taxing its oil and gas exports, arguing that doing so would disproportionately hurt its economy.
Other ideas have been floated.
Ford said that Ontario could pull American-made alcohol off shop shelves in the province, signalling a different approach in which different provincial premiers could define their own responses.
Another option is not retaliating - at least for now. For weeks, Canadian officials have been meeting their American counterparts in Washington DC in a bid to stave off any American tariffs in the first place.
But that seems unlikely, with Joly saying on Monday retaliatory tariffs would go into effect if the US imposed the 25% levies.
Canada has also signalled that it could bring in a relief programme for businesses harmed by the possible tariffs, similar to those introduced during the Covid pandemic.
Some argue, given the economic costs of retaliation, that Canada should instead focus on diversifying its trade relationships and increasing domestic production.
"We're a natural resource superpower," Mr Karaguesia said, adding that the country could use the tariffs as a push to harness that potential and sell its products elsewhere.

Headline: 'It never should have happened': Americans frustrated by Trump-Zelensky spat

Text: The shocking blow-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday continues to ripple across the globe, including through American voters who expressed frustration at one or both leaders.
The extraordinary scene saw Vice-President JD Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being "disrespectful" to the US, while Trump urged him to make a deal with Russia "or we are out".
Trump also accused the Ukrainian president of "gambling with World War Three" as Zelensky pushed back at suggestions that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. Zelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early.
World leaders and elected officials in the US have had much to say about the tense exchange, but so do American voters. We've asked five people what they think.
This South Carolina voter aligns himself with the Trump administration but he was frustrated by the Oval Office spat and wants the US to continue to back Ukraine.
It never should have happened. I blame both [Zelensky and Trump].
Zelensky did come across as arrogant, frankly. I get he was trying to make his point but he doesn't know how to deal with Trump. [UK Prime Minister Keir] Starmer knows how to deal with Trump, [French Prime Minister Emmanuel] Macron knows how to deal with Trump, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin definitely knows how to deal with Trump, but [Zelensky] doesn't know how to handle Trump.
Some of what Trump says is true. When he said Ukraine doesn't have the cards, [Zelensky] doesn't have the cards.
But Zelensky does have the cards in so far as saying that we will feel it in America shortly after Europe feels it, if Putin is appeased, because [Putin will] just reconstitute his forces and invade somebody else.
This Florida Democrat has repeatedly voted against Trump and said she was ashamed to call herself an American in the wake of the meeting.
I had to pause it a couple of times to give myself a few moments to cool off. I saw Trump and Vance steamrolling President Zelensky and refusing to let him get a word in edgewise.
They were selfish, rude, callous, and displayed a complete lack of basic human empathy.
It's hard to stay optimistic about the outcome of this war, and I knew something like this was likely to happen after Trump was re-elected.
I've been dreading this possibility since election day; however, I didn't anticipate Trump being this horrible about it. I'm terrified for Zelensky and Ukraine.
If more people had seen the full interaction between Trump and Zelensky, then this Pennsylvania voter says they would understand Trump's frustrations.
The majority of the American public is getting a sliver of what happened, I'm glad that was public but I wish people would watch the whole thing because I think they'd have a very different point of view.
This war needs to end, but it's not going to end the way Zelensky wants it to end. It's a sad state of affairs.
Zelensky was expecting it to go a lot differently and I give Vance and Trump a lot of credit for handling it the way it did.
Putin sitting there going, "Damn, I better behave because Trump is holding no prisoners."
This New Jersey voter has backed both Republicans and Democrats in the past but was "disgusted" by how Trump and Vance handled themselves in the Oval Office.
I was absolutely disgusted with it. Even if Zelensky and the Ukrainians were considered adversarial to us, you wouldn't talk to their head of state or head of government that way.
I would go beyond sending more aid to Ukraine - I would go as far as saying we should send military assets: putting planes in the air or putting boots on the ground.
[Putin] operates like a bully. The only way you're really going to get a bully to reconsider their actions is to stand up to them - you have to be willing to punch them in the mouth at some point in time.
This Indiana Trump voter wants to help Ukraine, but thinks there should be limit to US generosity to ensure Americans are taken care of too.
I want to help them as much as we can but we can't keep giving, giving, giving.
Zelensky had good reason to want more, but I feel like he was in the wrong to ask for it in that manner. If he did it in private, it would have been the place for it.
I didn't feel like Trump or Vance's reaction to it was wrong. It wasn't perfect, but I don't think it was a bad reaction per se. I hope there can be reconciliation after this, I want to help them end this war.
But if there isn't some middle ground they can find, I don't want to see the US to continue to spend and spend on a country that isn't ours when we have domestic problems.
This California voter was taken aback by the "arrogant stance" of Trump and Vance against Zelensky.
All it seemed like Trump and Vance wanted to do was "make a deal", in other words turn a profit from this conflict. Ukraine doesn't need trade partners. It needs allies, nations who aren't afraid to put some skin in this fight and fend off an invading enemy.
The world's leaders need to take in the full scope of this conflict and stop letting Vladimir Putin dictate the rules of engagement.
The war in Ukraine is not some limited regional border dispute. This is a case of full-blown invasion by one sovereign nation of another.
The war has gone on long enough for Ukraine to fight it without any other allies fighting alongside them in battle. Ukraine can't and shouldn't fight this war alone.
This Indiana voter supports the president but described Trump and Vance's behaviour as the wrong move.
In all my years alive, I've never seen anything like that before. I understand behind closed doors things like this happen, but the Oval Office is not where you're displaying your dirty laundry.
I'm not a big fan of Zelensky but I found what happened in the Oval Office the other day is embarrassing.
It's getting muddled up between the personalities on display there but the fact of the matter is Russia invaded Ukraine not once but twice.
Russia is the aggressor.
I understand the administration wants to show the world what we're dealing with, but we're supposed to be the leader of the world and good leaders don't lose their cool at this level.
I don't want to appear that I'm hostile of Trump, but I just think this style of leadership is not productive.

Text: A magnitude 3.9 earthquake has hit Hollywood as some of the globe's top stars began celebrating after the Oscars.
The earthquake's epicentre was measured in North Hollywood, just miles from where the awards ceremony was hosted at the Dolby Theatre.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The quake struck shortly after 22:00 local time as celebrities were gathering at the popular Vanity Fair afterparty.
Those in the area reported a sudden jolt of energy, with some screaming and seeing high-rise buildings wobbling like jelly.
The US Geological Survey (USGS), which tracks such events, said the earthquake was felt miles across Los Angeles.
There was no tsunami alert issued as a result of the relatively minor earthquake.
The Los Angeles Fire Department said that the earthquake was felt across downtown Los Angeles but the agency was not entering into "Earthquake Mode" over the incident.
For stronger earthquakes, first responders and officials do assessments of the area to ensure there is no structural damage to buildings and infrastructure.
The quake is among about 40 that have hit Southern California since the start of March - though nearly all of these were magnitude 1 earthquakes that aren't typically felt by residents, according to USGS data reviewed by the BBC.
Last month, there was a magnitude 3.7 earthquake that struck the nearby Malibu area. In December, a strong magnitude 7 earthquake jolted northern California and caused a short tsunami alert for those in northern California and southern Oregon.
BBC correspondents covering the Academy Awards in the heart of Hollywood reported fierce shaking and even some screams as the sudden jolt scared visitors. To some, it sounded like a bomb went off with the rumble.
One resident called it the biggest earthquake she'd felt and was surprised it was only a magnitude 3.9. "I felt that in my bones," she remarked.
The BBC's Emma Vardy said she was retouching her makeup for some final Oscars filming when the quake struck. Her rhinestone chandelier earrings wobbled in the mirror and she realised the high-rise she was in was shaking.
"I have felt a lot of quakes over the past two years in Los Angeles but currently, I am on the 15th floor of our media centre in Hollywood," she remarked. "Feeling a building of that size move around like jelly is quite an experience."

Text: An Illinois man has pleaded guilty to a deadly shooting at a 2022 Independence Day parade in a Chicago suburb that killed seven and injured dozens.
It is a surprise reversal for Robert Crimo III, who previously pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and attempted murder charges.
Crimo, 23, entered his guilty plea on Monday moments before opening arguments were due to begin in his trial.
He is accused of shooting at celebrating crowds from a roof in downtown Highland Park, about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north of Chicago.
Authorities had arrested him on the day of the shooting after a manhunt.
Crimo pleaded guilty before Judge Victoria Rossetti in a Lake County circuit courtroom, and did not say anything else before he was dismissed.
According to the Chicago Tribune, the suspect's mother briefly interrupted after he pleaded guilty, resulting in the judge warning her that she could be kicked out of the courtroom.
His trial was expected to last a month, with testimony from survivors and police.
Crimo faces seven murder counts and a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.
He is due to be sentenced on 23 April.
Prosecutors said they also turned over thousands of pages of evidence, including a videotaped interrogation during which police say the suspect had confessed to the shooting.
The victims killed in the shooting were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.
More than 40 others were injured, with victims ages ranging from their 80s to an eight-year-old boy who was left paralysed.
Prosecutors during the trial said Crimo had disguised himself in women's clothing before he accessed a rooftop and opened fire on parade-goers.
He then left the area, dropping his semi-automatic weapon.
Authorities said Crimo had driven for more than two hours to Wisconsin after the shooting before he was caught by police.
Police recovered 83 spent shell casings, as well as rifle magazines, from the scene of the shooting.

Headline: Provocative Trump statements about Canada loom large as Trudeau meets King

Text: King Charles has met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, under the shadow of inflammatory statements made about Canada by US President Donald Trump.
Trump has repeatedly spoken of making the neighbouring country the 51st state of America. He has also vowed to impose new import taxes on Canada, which is one of the US's top trading partners.
Ahead of his meeting with the King at Sandringham, outgoing PM Trudeau said he would discuss issues of importance to Canadians, including "standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation".
The King has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit him in what will be an unprecedented second state visit.
As head of state of the Commonwealth nation, the King has faced calls to give Canada his vocal backing in the face of Trump's statements.
Jason Kenney, the former leader of the Canadian province of Alberta, suggested Charles faces a difficult tightrope.
Jason Kenney, a conservative who served as Alberta's premier, wrote on X that the King could only act on the advice of the Canadian PM, who "should ask [Charles] to underscore Canadian sovereignty".
But the conservative politician then took aim at British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, whom he said had "cravenly thrown Canada under the bus" when he refused to comment on Trump's annexation threats during his visit to the White House last week.
"It was a shameful betrayal of a fellow realm which has made enormous sacrifices for the defence of Britain," Kenney wrote.
New import taxes announced by Trump are also set to come into effect on Tuesday, targeting goods arriving from China and Mexico as well as Canada.
The president is eager to protect American manufacturing and jobs, and to address the US trade deficit.
He suggested in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday that his country was effectively subsidising Canada by paying to import its products. Without this flow of capital, Canada "ceases to exist as a viable country", he wrote.
Trump has previously spoken of using "economic force" to make Canada the 51st state of America. But he said he was not considering using military force - an assurance he has not given while stating his ambitions of taking the Panama Canal and Greenland.
The question of how to respond to Trump's tariff threats and other statements about Canadian sovereignty has dominated the debate in Trudeau's Liberal Party, with candidates vying to replace the PM after he announced his resignation in January.
On the other side of the Canadian political divide, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has also attacked Trump's statements.
The King has found himself at the centre of a recent whirlwind of diplomatic meetings following Trump's return to the presidency - some of which relate to the war in Ukraine.
On Sunday, he also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who ended up in a row of his own with Trump at the White House on Friday.
Zelensky was in the UK to meet European leaders, who reiterated their support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia - with American support apparently on the wane under Trump.

Headline: Beyond the Gates: Inside the wealthy black community that inspired a soap opera
Author: Brandon Drenon, BBC News, reporting from Prince George's County
Published Date: 2025-03-03T10:25:46.358Z
Text: Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.
Located in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.
Although it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with "black excellence", locals told the BBC.
To live there, Patricia Gafford says: "You've got to have money – lots of it."
Though Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, "'it's a little bit too rich for us'".
The setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.
Kristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.
"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception," she told the BBC.
Yet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has "never" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.
She says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of "elegance and glamour and style and fashion", as well as the trademark "messiness" of the day-time plot lines.
The show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County.
The long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.
The depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.
"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses," Ms Balgar says.
In Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (£170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.
Ms Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf.
She says Beyond the Gates has been "all over social" media and that "everyone is excited" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.
Long before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.
One of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.
"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner," says Ms Pearl.
The county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after "a wave of violence" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.
Black Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.
The area soon became known for its affluence.
At the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.
Federal jobs "played a huge role" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.
By the late 80s, "McMansions" owned by black families began popping up, she added.
Meanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called "white flight".
Yet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.
The history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a "strange time", media professor Ms Warner says: "The soap opera is nearly extinct."
For most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.
NBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.
The soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Beyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of "goodwill" that Ms Warner says is now being "rolled back".
"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us," Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.
The club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space.
"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me," says Mrs Gafford, a member.
"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter," she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black.
"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family," he agrees.
There are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.
She believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.
"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there," Ms Wiseman says.
She opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.
It's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.
That's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.
"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you," she says.
"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV."

Text: Actor Morgan Freeman has led tributes at the annual Academy Awards ceremony to fellow Hollywood star Gene Hackman, whose death last month is under police investigation.
"This week, our community lost a giant and I lost a dear friend," said Freeman, who worked with Hackman in two films, including 1992's Unforgiven, which won Hackman his second Oscar.
"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him I learned he was a generous performer whose gifts elevated everyone's work," Freeman said.
Hackman, 95, and his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found dead at their home in New Mexico days ago.
"He received two Oscars but more importantly he won the hearts of film-lovers all over the world," Freeman said in his speech during Sunday night's 97th Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles.
He added that Hackman had told him: "I don't think about legacy, I just hope people remember me as someone who tried to do good work."
"Gene, you'll be remembered for that and so much more. Rest in peace, my friend."
Morgan, 87, also starred alongside Hackman in 2000 film Under Suspicion.
The Oscars ceremony also featured an in memoriam segment, where clips from some of the character actor's best films over his 60-year career were shown.
Hackman was known for such movies as The French Connection, The Conversation, Bonnie and Clyde, Mississippi Burning and Superman, but had not starred in a film since his retirement from acting in 2004.
Officials found Hackman and Ms Arakawa's bodies on Wednesday, about 10 days after investigators believe he died.
The results of a post-mortem examination are pending, and officials say it may take weeks to determine how the couple died.
The Oscars ceremony also featured a tribute to music producer Quincy Jones, led by Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah and Queen Latifah, who sang a song in his memory.
Jones received seven Oscar nominations in in his lifetime, including in 1967 when he became the first black composer to be nominated for the original song category.
Jones died in November at the age of 91.

Headline: Crypto prices rally after Trump backs five coins for 'crypto reserve'

Text: US President Donald Trump has revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he says he'd like to be included in a new strategic reserve to make the US "the Crypto Capital of the World".
The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano - all swiftly jumped after the announcement.
During Trump's presidential campaign, he aggressively courted the crypto community. The previous US president, Joe Biden, had overseen a crackdown on crypto due to concerns about fraud and money laundering.
It is unclear how the new stockpile will work. More information is expected on Friday, when Trump plans to host the first Crypto Summit at the White House.
In a social media post on Sunday, Trump said he had signed an order which "directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA".
About an hour later he added in another post: "And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve."
The first three coins he named jumped by up to 62% on Sunday.
Bitcoin and Ethereum also jumped by more than 10% each.
The posts marked a new upward turn for crypto prices, which had dropped sharply since spiking after his election.
Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations.
The order called on the group to "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile" that could use "cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts".
It is unclear whether creating a new national strategic stockpile would require an act of Congress.
Trump had previously been a crypto critic, telling Fox News in 2021 that Bitcoin is a "scam".
But in recent weeks, both he and his wife Melania Trump have launched their own cryptocurrencies, leading to accusations that they are trying to profit from his White House policies.

Headline: Trump makes English official language of US

Text: President Donald Trump has signed an executive order making English the official language of the United States.
It means government agencies and organisations that receive federal funding can choose whether they want to offer documents and services in languages other than English.
It rescinds a policy that required such bodies to provide language assistance to non-English speakers signed by former president Bill Clinton in 2000.
"Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society," the order says.
This marks the first time the US has designated an official language at the federal level since the country was founded almost 250 years ago.
It is noted in the order that agencies do not need to change, remove or stop offering any such assistance they already provide.
"In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream," the order reads.
"Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society."
It also says it celebrates the "long tradition of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it to their children for generations to come".
Nearly 68 million of the country's 340 million residents speak a language other than English, according to the US Census Bureau.
This includes more than 160 Native American languages.
Spanish, various Chinese languages and Arabic are among the languages spoken the most after English, according to the Census Bureau.
Republicans have previously tried to get English designated as the US's official language, with members of the House introducing legislation that failed in 2021.
Those who opposed their efforts said an official language was not necessary given the high numbers of people who speak English without it being designated as such.
They also said establishing one could promote discrimination against non-English speakers.
During his presidential campaign in 2024, Trump referenced non-English languages while calling for stricter immigration policies.
"It's the craziest thing - they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It's a very horrible thing," he told a crowd of supporters in February 2024.
Approximately 180 countries around the world have official national languages, and most countries recognise multiple official languages.
Several countries do not have an official language, including the United Kingdom.
More than 30 US states have designated English as the official language, while Alaska and Hawaii have also given official status to several native languages.

Text: Protesters in the US have lined a road in Vermont that Vice-President JD Vance was due to drive down following his and President Trump's angry exchange with Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.
They held up pro-Ukraine signs on the route in Waitsfield that Vance and his family were expected to take on their way to go skiing.
US media reported the family moved to an undisclosed location from their planned ski resort because of the demonstrations.
Hundreds of people also gathered in New York, Los Angeles and Boston on Saturday to express their support for Ukraine - a day after the furious row in the Oval Office.
The extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office saw Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being disrespectful to the US.
Trump also clashed with Zelensky, telling him to make a deal with Russia "or we are out" and accusing him of "gambling with World War Three".
A protest in Waitsfield against the Trump-Vance administration had been organised earlier in the week - before the US president and vice-president's clash with Zelensky - but many signs referenced the row and Russia's war with Ukraine.
"I think [Friday's] performance at the White House has probably galvanised even more people to come out today," Judy Daly, from Indivisible Mad River Valley, the group which organised the protest, told Vermont Public Radio.
"[Vance] crossed the line," protester Cori Giroux added.
Ahead of the Vance family's trip, Vermont's governor Phil Scott had urged people to "be respectful" to them.
Scott, the Republican governor who refused to vote for Trump, said: "I welcome the vice-president and his family to Vermont and hope they enjoy their weekend here.
"It's no surprise they chose Vermont, we've had a lot of snow this winter, which has been good for our economy."
He added: "I hope Vermonters remember the vice-president is here on a family trip with his young children and, while we may not always agree, we should be respectful.
"Please join me in welcoming them to Vermont, and hoping they have an opportunity to experience what makes our state, and Vermonters, so special."
Vance, who has three young children with his wife Usha, has not publicly commented on the protests. Counter-protesters supporting Trump and Vance were also reportedly in Waitsfield.
Separately, demonstrators also gathered outside Tesla stores in the US on Saturday to protest against Elon Musk's push to slash government spending.
Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla, has been tasked by Trump to oversee the Department of Government Efficiency, more popularly known as Doge.
After the meeting at the White House, Zelensky flew to the UK where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and on Sunday he joined European leaders and Canada's Justin Trudeau in London for a summit to discuss ways of ending the war in Ukraine and ensuring Europe's security.
Ahead of the summit, Starmer said the UK and France would work with Ukraine "on a plan to stop the fighting" with Russia and would then "discuss that plan with the United States".
He told the BBC that his "driving purpose" right now was to act as a "bridge" between the two men.
Asked about how he felt watching the spat in the White House, Starmer sought to play down the incident, saying "nobody wants to see that" and admitted he felt "uncomfortable".

Headline: Private spacecraft Blue Ghost lands on Moon
Author: George Sandeman, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-02T10:43:47.369Z
Text: A private spacecraft has landed on the Moon, becoming only the second commercial vehicle to reach the lunar surface.
Blue Ghost left Earth on 15 January, after being launched by US firm Firefly Aerospace with the intention of exploring the Sea of Crises, a huge basin visible from Earth.
The project is the latest collaboration by US space agency Nasa and private companies.
Intuitive Machines, another firm, is hoping to land its Athena spacecraft near the Moon's south pole in the next few days.
Intuitive was the first private company to achieve a lunar landing. Its spacecraft Odysseus reached the Moon on 22 February last year.
However, the mission was short-lived as the spacecraft landed on the slope of a crater, broke some landing gear and toppled over.
Blue Ghost touched down smoothly, having been orbiting the Moon for the last two weeks.
Staff at Firefly's headquarters in Texas broke out into cheering and applause when they were told their landing was successful.
Dr Simeon Barber, a planetary science researcher from the Open University, said Blue Ghost was essentially the first successful private venture to the Moon, as the vehicle was intact and responsive.
He told BBC Breakfast: "[They've] demonstrated a technology for landing on the surface of the Moon, the kind that had been forgotten after the Apollo era when we had astronauts on the [lunar] surface."
The importance of the Moon to many private firms, said Dr Barber, was to use it as a launch pad for exploring the rest of space.
"By going to the Moon, we can learn how to run robotic instruments in space [and] in the really harsh environment of the Moon, which is at times hot and at times cold. It's very dusty, there's lots of radiation."
He said at some point it was likely humans would return to the lunar surface and explained it had been so long because of a lack of funding.
The last time humans set foot on the Moon was 19 December 1972, during the Apollo 17 mission.
"The Apollo missions were hugely successful," explained Dr Barber. "But they were 'touch and go' missions."
Back then, astronauts would be there for three days before having to leave again, as costs were running into the billions of dollars. "That's not sustainable," he said.
Dr Barber said the belief now was that bringing private companies into the fold would help reduce costs as a result of commercial competition.
It could lead to cheaper landers and innovations that might extract resources from the moon, such as water for the astronauts to drink.
The first private company to attempt to reach the moon was another US firm, Astrobotic Technology.
They tried reaching the moon in January 2024, but their lander never made it to the moon, because of a suspected fuel leak, and crashed back to Earth.
The fiery descent meant the spacecraft broke apart in its final moments before plunging into the southern Pacific Ocean.

Text: Grammy-nominated R&B artist Angie Stone has died after a car crash, aged 63, her daughter says.
"My mommy is gone," her daughter, Diamond Stone, wrote in a Facebook post.
Stone was fatally injured when a van she was travelling in overturned in Alabama early on Saturday following a performance, according to media reports.
The artist, who was behind songs like No More Rain (In This Cloud) and Wish I Didn't Miss You, was nominated for three Grammys over her career. She started out in the 1970s as a member of the female hip-hop trio The Sequence.
The group's most popular song, Funk You Up, peaked at 15 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles.
Her daughter, who is also a musician and goes by the nickname Ladi Diamond, said on Facebook that she was "numb". Hours earlier, she had asked for prayers for her family and said she was on the road.
A spokesperson for the artist told the BBC that her family had travelled to Montgomery, Alabama, and planned to release more information soon.
Guy Todd Williams, known as Rahiem in the hip-hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, said about nine other passengers were in a van with Stone at the time of the crash.
"She left her indelible mark on the music industry initially as a member of the legendary rap group Sequence," Williams said.
He said she was the sole fatality in the crash.
The BBC has contacted police in Montgomery for details.
Along with her music career, Stone also had some success in film.
She made her movie debut with a role in The Hot Chick, a 2002 hit starring Rob Schneider, Rachel McAdams and Anna Faris.
She also starred in The Fighting Temptations in 2003 with Cuba Gooding Jr and Beyonce.

Headline: Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announces run for New York City mayor
Author: Max Matza and Christal Hayes, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-01T19:47:49.941Z
Text: Andrew Cuomo, who resigned four years ago as New York governor under a cloud of scandal, has declared he is running for mayor of New York City.
"Our city is in crisis," Cuomo posted in a 17-minute video on X, adding: "We need government to work. We need effective leadership."
It heralds a potential political comeback in this year's election for the Democrat, who quit in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations and scrutiny of his handling of the Covid pandemic.
America's most populous city is in a state of political turmoil as current Mayor Eric Adams denies claims he struck a deal to help the Trump administration with migrant raids in exchange for dropping a federal corruption case against him.
The former governor joins an already crowded contest, which includes lawmakers, young newcomers and Mayor Adams himself, though it is Cuomo who has the most name recognition.
The three-term governor resigned after an investigation found he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees.
The state-led inquiry determined he had made sexual comments, inappropriately touched or groped the women and kissed them without consent.
At the time, President Joe Biden led calls from Democrats for the embattled Cuomo to step down, and state lawmakers raised the prospect of impeachment.
When the governor left office, he denied harassing anyone, but said he wanted to "deeply, deeply" apologise to any women who might have been offended by his actions.
Cuomo's stunning downfall happened a year after he basked in the adulation of millions of Americans who had tuned in daily to his no-nonsense televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.
But a report in 2022 found that under his administration, the state hid at least 4,100 Covid-related nursing home deaths from the public.
Cuomo admitted to a "delay" in reporting, but denied allegations that his administration purposely misled New Yorkers.
Opinion polling by New York media in recent weeks has projected that Cuomo would become frontrunner if he entered the mayoral race.
Days before the campaign was launched, Cuomo received the surprise backing of congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents the Bronx.
"Andrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics - both from the far left and far right," he told the New York Post.
"We don't need a Mr Nice Guy. We need a Mr Tough Guy."
Cuomo's supporters have also launched a political action committee called Fix the City, which states it aims to raise $15m (£12m) for his campaign war chest.
One of Cuomo's former aides who accused him of sexual harassment told the New York Post on Saturday that she fears women's rights will suffer if he wins election.
"New York City may elect a mayor who has been rightfully accused of sexual misconduct by several young women who worked for him in up-close positions," said Karen Hinton.
"As a movement, we women haven't done enough to toughen laws to protect women from such immoral, unethical, and what should be illegal behaviour by men in positions of power, such as Cuomo."
The Democratic primary vote will take place in June. The eventual winner is expected to defeat any Republican challenger during November's election and become the city's next mayor.
Adams has chosen to remain in the race, even while facing federal fraud, bribery and other charges.
The Trump administration is seeking to dismiss the charges, arguing that the charges have damaged the mayor's ability to aid the president's agenda and were politically motivated.
The attempt caused Manhattan's lead prosecutor and six other high-level federal prosecutors in New York to resign in protest, saying there was no legal justification for the White House directive to end the prosecution.
Meanwhile, the judge in the case has cancelled the upcoming trial in April as he works to decide whether the case should be dropped or not.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who took over for Cuomo after he resigned, said last month that she was declining to use her authority to replace Adams, at least for now, and would instead move to limit his authority.
Adams has denied making a "quid pro quo" with Trump's office to help in the removal of illegal migrants, last month calling the assertion "silly".
Adams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denies the charges.
His office has been plagued by staff departures and scandals, even before charges were pressed against him. A number of figures in his orbit have also been indicted as part of the investigation.

Headline: Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Why?
Author: James Landale, Diplomatic correspondent•@BBCJLandale, •

Text: JD Vance's remarkable dressing down of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday showed the US vice-president unafraid to take centre stage as an attack dog, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy.
It was Vance who led the attack on Zelensky before Donald Trump joined the fray at the White House in a meeting that had been cordial until the vice-president spoke up to laud the president for seeking what he described as a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine-Russia war.
"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?" said Zelensky, who has been critical of direct talks between Washington and Moscow. "What do you mean?"
"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country," Vance responded, tearing into the stunned Ukrainian leader.
"Mr President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media."
He also accused Zelensky of having campaigned on behalf of Democrats during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a munitions factory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met Trump's rival, Kamala Harris, at the White House.
Vance's upbraiding of Zelensky drew broad support among Republicans.
"I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country," said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy hawk. He suggested Zelensky should resign.
Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as "that Ukrainian weasel".
Congressman Mike Lawler of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was "a missed opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine".
Vance's remarkable attack on a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president.
Their job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency.
The contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater.
But Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly sceptical of US aid to Ukraine.
When he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: "I've got to be honest with you. I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other."
The vice-president derided Trump as an idiot eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement.
Despite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was "too early" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028.
Undeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political brawler for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken criticism of the administration's foes.
One common thread is that many victims of Vance's tongue-lashing are America's allies.
It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there.
But Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.
"If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you," he said.
The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified.
This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.
This was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.
Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.
His speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.
Yet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.
Vance accused him of "moralistic garbage", "historical illiteracy" and - worst of all - of being a "globalist".
And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.
Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that "there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens".
The prime minister pushed back firmly, saying "in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there… We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time".
This was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.
The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.
Several questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe?
White House sources have told US papers it was not.
Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents?
Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?
Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.

Headline: Pilates, painting and bike rides: Gene Hackman's life in Santa Fe
Author: Samantha Granville, BBC News, Reporting fromSante Fe, New Mexico
Published Date: 2025-03-01T11:16:44.140Z
Text: Gene Hackman was a normal person in Santa Fe. And he really loved that.
Residents in the New Mexico city say they were excited to welcome such a massive celebrity to the community when he and his wife Betsy Arakawa arrived more than 20 years ago, but they treated him like anyone else.
"He wasn't famous here" was the phrase I heard when asking residents about why the movie star chose to call New Mexico's capital home. They describe a down-to-earth, chatty man who supported local businesses and enjoyed its flourishing arts scene.
Everyone here has a story to tell about Hackman, who was found dead alongside his wife and their dog at their home in the quiet desert city earlier this week.
Hackman was a lover of the arts and a painter himself, so he fit in well: Santa Fe is known for its iconic adobe architecture and is home to more than 250 galleries.
Everything in Santa Fe is colourful, from the woven tapestry hanging on shop walls to the clothes people wear and even their personalities.
There are murals in almost every alley and metal street art lining the roads.
Hackman immediately got involved with local art museums, most notably sitting on the board of directors at the Georgia O'Keeffe museum, while Arakawa had a luxury home-goods store, and collaborated with artists on various projects.
Hackman's paintings are displayed prominently at local restaurants, and there are a few lucky residents who have them hanging in their home.
One of those people is Stuart Ashman, the executive director of the Artes de Cuba gallery.
Mr Ashman first met Hackman at a community arts meeting. He was running late and there was one seat left when he arrived: next to the Hollywood star.
They shook hands and that started two decades of friendship.
"He was so down to earth that you didn't realize that you were talking to a celebrity. He was more interested in you than in telling you about himself," Mr Ashman said.
While both men supported the arts community, their real bond came through Pilates workouts when they took back-to-back private lessons.
When asked who was better, Mr Ashman laughed. "I think we're both pretty bad," he said. "Our teacher said I was lazy and he was older and stiffer."
Mr Ashman said Hackman often got in trouble for being too much of a chatterbox.
"Gene, are you going to workout or do you just want to talk to Stuart today?" Mr Ashman recalls their Pilates teacher asking.
Every week, Mr Ashman, who raised chickens, would bring a dozen eggs to Hackman.
Then one day, he showed up with a huge landscape painting as repayment to Mr Ashman, who didn't want to accept it. But Hackman insisted and said a painting for eggs is "a very fair deal".
When Hackman wasn't at Pilates or riding his bike through the beautiful landscape, he loved to spend time at his home in the hills above the city, his friends said.
Perched on a 12-acre plot, the property has panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, with vistas stretching as far as Colorado.
Hackman purchased the home in the 1980s before starting expansive renovations. He wanted this home to have meaning, so he worked with an architect to blend Pueblo, Colonial, and Spanish Baroque architectural styles to pay homage to Santa Fe's rich cultural history.
Arakawa also enjoyed her secluded life in Santa Fe. People I spoke to said she was a talented pianist and smart business woman.
The only person who liked working out more than Hackman was Betsy. They said she was in incredible shape, always attending exercise classes.
Though Hackman was an active member of the community for most of his post-Hollywood years, he became much more isolated after Covid-19 lockdowns, locals said.
Those who knew him speculate his health and age made mobility too difficult to wander down the hill into town.
But everyone still had a story about Hackman.
James Roybal, a native of Santa Fe, once signed up for a pastel painting class in the 1980s and when he arrived Hackman was also there.
They painted next to each other for a bit, making small talk.
Mr Roybal couldn't believe the celebrity would want to be there. He took a picture from a ways back because he didn't think anyone would believe him. He still boasts about the image.
Victoria Murphy, a real estate agent and actress, saw him around town on several occasions.
"I was in the middle of the street as I was crossing in the crosswalk, and he started to go through the stop sign at that time, and then suddenly saw me stopped, waved, smiled, held up both hands, you know, like in a surrender," she recalled. "And I just smiled and kept going."
At a local restaurant in town, customers told me they'd see him at the grocery store, or shopping on the high street.
David, the general manager of a shop in downtown Santa Fe where Hackman was a long-time patron, was holding back tears, remembering his friend and client.
"Since he lived here, he wanted to use his money towards the local people. He always bought Seiko watches from my store for his friends and family.
"He invested in local restaurants and grocery stores, and showed up to openings for art museums. It obviously wasn't because he needed the money, but because he loved the local flare," he said.
"We lost a great Santa Fein."

Headline: RFK's measles response under scrutiny as deadly outbreak frightens Texas parents
Author: Madeline Halpert, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-01T08:33:30.051Z
Text: In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.
On Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die – the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.
With a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.
"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around," said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.
The US declared measles "eliminated" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.
The Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.
On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak "not unusual", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.
Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.
"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions," Leah said.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.
Since the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.
She has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.
"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic," she told the BBC.
Ms Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.
People who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.
That includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.
Mr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.
"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that," he said.
To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.
But several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.
"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community," said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.
Now, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.
"I share that concern with them," said Dr Malbari.
Before Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.
He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.
During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to "do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult" to get vaccines.
But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.
He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.
Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.
The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.
But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is "what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination".
On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.
In addition to calling the Texas outbreak "not unusual", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.
Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.
"It's a devastating disease," he said. "And it's completely preventable."
For some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.
Leah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.
"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs," she said.
But Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.
Still, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.
"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice," she said.
Local health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.
"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more," he said. "It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine."

Headline: Cuts to national parks and forests met with backlash

Text: The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.
The impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding.
Each season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.
Remote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance.
"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done," she says.
"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience."
But one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.
As a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.
"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen," she says.
On any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes.
Now, those jobs are gone.
She worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit.
Mass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff – around 1,000 workers - being forced out.
The cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.
The cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.
Long queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.
A popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is "due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees" and "will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels".
At Yosemite National Park, the annual "firefall" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.
Andria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she "100%" supports the protest.
"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue," she says.
She says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.
Ms Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.
"They both are in dire straits," she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.
Staff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.
"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now," she says.
"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain."
Long-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.
The email firing them and thousands of other staff cited "performance" issues – something they took issue with.
"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond," says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.
He and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses – and never being paid more than $22 (£17.40) an hour.
"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all," Ms Thompson added.
Following a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.
"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job," Burgum told Fox News last Friday.
"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit."
The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.
Outdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.
"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations," says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.
Some of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.
Meanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.
Concerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.
Wildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are "completely crucial" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for "sweeping" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.
"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them," says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.
"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse."

Headline: Trump accuses Zelensky of 'gambling with World War Three'

Text: Donald Trump has clashed with Volodymyr Zelensky in a furious exchange at the White House, with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia "or we are out".
The pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal.
After relations first became strained over Trump's handling of Ukraine peace talks with Russia, the minerals agreement was supposed to be a stepping stone towards further security ties between the countries.
But Zelensky was told by the Americans to leave before the deal could be signed.
At one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support, and that he was "gambling with World War Three".
Zelensky had earlier argued there should be "no compromises" with Russian President Vladimir Putin - but Trump said Kyiv would have to make concessions to reach a peace deal with Russia.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory.
The meeting to discuss the US-Ukraine deal, which involved access to Ukrainian oil, gas and rare minerals, came after the new US president appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier.
His tone had softened in recent days, with Trump saying he had "a lot of respect" for the Ukrainian leader.
But Friday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sat alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.
Zelensky responded by asking "what kind of diplomacy?", referencing a previous ceasefire deal in 2019, agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.
The vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and "litigating" the situation in front of the media.
From there, the discussion escalated quickly, as Trump and Vance accused Ukraine's president of being ungrateful for three years of US support during the war with Russia, with Trump saying Zelensky was in no position to tell the US how it should feel.
Not long after the meeting - and well ahead of the pre-planned schedule - Zelensky was seen leaving the White House in his official vehicle.
Trump took to Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, to say "Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office".
"I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations," the Republican president continued. "I don't want advantage, I want PEACE."
Zelensky also posted on social media, thanking the president and the US four times.
In a later interview with Fox News, Zelensky said the public spat "was not good" - but the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged.
"Because the relations are more than just two presidents," he said, adding that it was also about "strong relations between our two people."
Reaction to the White House meeting among US politicians appeared to fall along partisan lines, with Republicans praising Trump and Democrats criticising him.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - once a staunch supporter of Ukraine - told reporters: "What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again."
He said Zelensky "either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change".
Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries described Zelensky's treatment as "appalling", adding that it "will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin".
In Ukraine, there was broadly appreciation for Zelensky holding his ground over what is, for them, an existential war.
"Trump's administration was so arrogant," one man in Kyiv told the BBC. "When you look at Zelensky's face, you understand that the discussion behind the closed doors was not so polite.
"They are so rude, they don't respect the people of Ukraine. They even don't hide it."
The Oval Office spat also prompted words of support for Zelensky from key European allies, including France.
A spokeswoman for UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - who has cast himself as a mediator between the US and Europe as the Trump administration adopts a more isolationist approach to the continent - said he had spoken to both leaders.
She said Sir Keir "retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace".
Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, wrote that he stood with Ukraine "in good and testing times", adding: "We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war."
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that "today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge".
Russia, meanwhile, said Trump and Vance had acted with restraint. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said it was a miracle the pair hadn't hit Zelensky.

Text: An Illinois landlord has been found guilty of murder and hate crime charges for fatally stabbing a Palestinian-American child in 2023 and severely wounding his mother.
Prosecutors said Joseph Czuba, 73, targeted the family over their Muslim faith following the Israel-Hamas war.
Police found six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, with severe stab wounds inside a house she rented from Czuba in a Chicago suburb on 14 October, 2023. The boy later died in the hospital.
Czuba had pleaded not guilty, but jurors convicted him after deliberating for less than 90 minutes.
Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting
After the verdict, the boy's father, Odai,told reporters in Arabic: "I don't know if I should be pleased or upset, if I should be crying or laughing."
"I feel like this decision came a little too late," he said.
Jurors heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Al-Fayoume's mother.
Ms Shaheen testified that she rented rooms from Czuba in suburban Chicago, and had no problems with him at first.
But tensions escalated after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, 2023, with Czuba expressing anti-Muslim views and asking her to move out of the home, where he also lived.
A few days after that conversation, Czuba forced his way into her room and stabbed her with a knife more than a dozen times, Ms Shaheen testified.
"He told me 'You, as a Muslim, must die,'" she said.
After she retreated to call for help, Ms Shaheen said Czuba attacked her son. Prosecutors said the child had been stabbed 26 times. He died from the injuries shortly after the attack.
Police testified that they found Czuba outside the house after the attack, with blood on his body and hands.
Lawyers for Czuba defended him by arguing that pieces of evidence linking him to the crimes were missing. His ex-wife testified in the trial, and said he rarely had violent outbursts in their 30-year marriage.
But jurors found him guilty of the crimes after a short deliberation. Czuba faces life in prison without parole. Sentencing is scheduled for May.
The young boy had celebrated his sixth birthday just a few weeks before he was killed.
"He loved his family, his friends. He loved soccer, he loved basketball," the executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Ahmed Rehab, said at the time.

Text: The day began with the same cordial routine the White House reserves for visiting foreign dignitaries.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was welcomed by US President Donald Trump at the door of the West Wing with an honour guard, and the leaders shook hands politely.
We were in the Oval Office as part of Ukrainian media pool, witnessing the well-rehearsed formalities and about half an hour of polite talk.
Zelensky presented Trump with the championship belt of Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk.
Trump complimented Zelensky's clothing.
So far, so diplomatic.
But minutes later, what erupted was unprecedented to say the least. The genial tone devolved into acrimony and chaos. Voices were raised, eyes rolled, aspersions cast - and all in front of the world's TV cameras.
The US president and vice-president berated the visiting leader, accusing Zelensky of not being grateful enough for US support that has sustained Ukraine's war effort.
Tensions flared when Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.
What kind of diplomacy, Zelensky replied.
Talking over the Ukrainian president, Vance told the visiting leader it was "disrespectful" for him to come to the Oval Office and make his case in front of the American media and demanded that he thank Trump for his leadership.
Journalists in the room watched with gaping mouths as an extraordinary exchange followed.
"You've done enough talking. You're not winning this," Trump told him at one point. "You gotta be thankful. You don't have the cards."
"I'm not playing cards," Zelensky replied. "I'm very serious, Mr President. I'm the president in a war."
"You're gambling with World War Three," Trump responded. "And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have."
Vance retorted: "Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting? No."
Ukraine's ambassador to the US watched with her head in her hands.
The atmosphere had shifted entirely - and all out in the open.
Our American colleagues remarked that they had never seen anything like it. "A scene like this was simply unimaginable in the White House," one told me.
As reporters exited the Oval Office, many stood still in a state of shock. In the White House briefing room, where the exchange was replayed shortly afterwards, the rest of the media who hadn't been in the room watched in disbelief.
Confusion ensued. There were immediate questions about whether the planned news conference would go ahead – or if the much-anticipated deal between the US and Ukraine over mineral resources would even be signed.
Minutes later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Zelensky could "come back when he is ready for peace".
The news conference and deal-signing ceremony - set to take place in the East Room of the White House - was officially cancelled.
Soon after Zelensky strode out and into a waiting SUV, as his ambassador trailed behind him.
They pulled away as the world was only beginning to digest an extraordinary moment.
Despite the full-blown argument, there may still be a minerals deal sooner or later.
But one thing is certain: this visit by Zelensky will be remembered for entirely different reasons.
The world saw first-hand how negotiations between the US and Ukraine are unfolding: they are difficult, emotional, and tense.
It was clear that this was a tough negotiation for both parties.
The gift of Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk's belt certainly didn't save the situation. And after this bout at the White House, the real question now is what this means for the war in Ukraine - and Zelensky's own future.

Headline: Eleven things Trump and his team did this week

Text: President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.
His sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.
The wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.
A tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short.
If you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.
One of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras.
During what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia "or we are out".
The exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of "litigating" the situation in front of the media.
It escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be "thankful" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was "gambling with World War Three."
The Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.
In a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said "Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office."
"He can come back when he is ready for peace," Trump said.
Ahead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals.
Zelensky had said he hoped the "preliminary" agreement with the US would "lead to further deals", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet.
Notably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a "dictator" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: "Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that."
But Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.
Trump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member.
A big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy.
On the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for "a significant reduction" in their staff by 13 March.
French President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.
Trump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
After the meeting, Macron said Trump had "good reason" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine.
Trump said there was a "very good chance" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where "tariffs wouldn't be necessary". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made "pretty quickly".
Part way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.
Trump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: "Am I supposed to read it right now?"
After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an "honour" to visit the "fantastic" country.
Trump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.
The clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the "riviera" of the Middle East.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (£792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high.
Officials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.
Trump unveiled plans for selling a "gold card" visa for $5m (£3.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.
The president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to "high-level people".
"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs," Trump said. "It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain."
Republicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda.
It includes $4.5 trillion (£3.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.
However, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.
Trump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.
"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation," Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. "They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them."
The Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.

Headline: Francis Ford Coppola named worst director at Razzies
Author: Noor Nanji, Culture reporter in Los Angeles•@NoorNanji, •

Text: Francis Ford Coppola, one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers, has been named worst director for his self-financed project Megalopolis in this year's Razzies.
Announced two days before the Oscars reward Hollywood's finest, the Razzie Awards name and shame the year's worst films.
In an Instagram post, Coppola said he was "thrilled" to accept the award, "at a time when so few have the courage to go against the prevailing trends of contemporary movie-making".
Madame Web picked up the award for worst picture, screenplay and actress for its star Dakota Johnson, while Joker: Folie à Deux also collected two awards.
The organisers have described their awards as the "ugly cousin to the Oscars".
Megalopolis, an epic fantasy starring Adam Driver, Shia LaBeouf, Aubrey Plaza and Nathalie Emmanuel, cost Coppola a reported $120m (£95m).
It also faced controversy after the trailer was withdrawn by studio Lionsgate, because the clip included fabricated quotes from real film critics about the filmmaker's previous works.
"Even a cinematic maestro occasionally musters up a misfire," the Razzies said, in a press release announcing Coppola's win.
It comes almost exactly 50 years after Coppola won a best director Oscar for The Godfather part II.
In his Instagram post, Coppola said: "In this wreck of a world today, where art is given scores as if it were professional wrestling, I chose to not follow the gutless rules laid down by an industry so terrified of risk that despite the enormous pool of young talent at its disposal, may not create pictures that will be relevant and alive 50 years from now."
He concluded his post by thanking everyone who worked on the film, adding: "Box office is only about money, and like war, stupidity and politics has no true place in our future."
Elsewhere, Madame Web, the fourth film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, picked up three awards after being branded a "tangled mess" by critics.
Starring Johnson and Sydney Sweeney, both the film premise and the acting came under fire in a string of one-star reviews.
Based on Marvel Comics, the film centres around a paramedic with arachnid-based psychic powers.
The trailer went viral in 2023 for its "laughably unsure tone".
Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel and Worst Screen Combo were both "won" by Joker: Folie à Deux.
The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, was a much-anticipated sequel to its predecessor, 2019's Joker, but it largely disappointed critics.
There was better news, however, for Pamela Anderson, who earned this year's Razzie halo for her role as a fading dancer in The Last Showgirl.
Other winners include Jon Voight as Worst Supporting Actor for Megalopolis, Reagan, Shadow Land and Strangers, as well as Jerry Seinfeld (Worst Actor) and Amy Schumer (Supporting Actress) both for Unfrosted.

Headline: Lil Baby criticises 'nonsense' link between music video and killings

Text: Rapper Lil Baby has described a link made between one of his music videos and the killing of two teenagers in the US as "nonsense".
Jakody Davis and Lamon Freeman died following a gang-related shootout at Lamon's 13th birthday party in Atlanta, Georgia, last summer.
And while city detectives did not name Lil Baby, real name Dominique Armani Jones, they said the boys had been innocent victims of a flare up of gang violence sparked by a "cowardly rapper" filming a video in rival territory.
In a statement via lawyers, Lil Baby, who spent weeks in the UK charts for Band4Band with Central Cee, said he had "absolutely no involvement" and branded the comments from police "shameful".
During a press conference on Wednesday, detectives from City of Atlanta Police said how Jakody and Lamon weren't the intended targets of the shooting at the Sparks Street apartment complex in the city on 2 July 2024.
They detailed how the attack had been "orchestrated" from prison and involved members of "one of the most hyperviolent gangs in the city of Atlanta".
Addressing reporters, Maj Ralph Woolfolk said "the overall theme of this case is grown men playing gangster that left two of our children in graves and our communities in fear".
"Lamon Freeman was allowed to be a teenager for 27 minutes before gang violence ultimately took his life, gang violence that was orchestrated by adults and cowardly acts of an Atlanta-based rapper."
The rapper, he said, "decided to go over into a rival gang stronghold and shoot a music video in a place that he knew he should not have been.
"And in the subsequent days, we saw homicides and shootings and ultimately the deaths of two children as a result of his cowardly actions."
In the months before Lamon and Jakody were shot, Atlanta police said they responded to several people being shot during a video shoot.
Nobody was killed but three men in their 20s were injured in the attack in the north west of the city on 14 May which was widely reported to have taken place on set for one of Lil Baby's videos.
Lil Baby's statement said it was "disgraceful" for the officer "to say that he couldn't shoot a music video in his home town".
"The location for a major music video shoot is a decision made by a professional team and is not a decision made by any individual."
Maj Woolfolk told reporters the attack which killed Lamon and Jakody was a "hit called by a high-ranking gang member on the opposite side of that opposing rapper's gang".
He did not name Lil Baby but said "you know who you are" which Lil Baby's lawyer called an "obvious reference" that was "complete and total nonsense".
"Bringing his name into a conversation regarding a terrible crime for which he had absolutely no involvement is unprofessional, unethical and shameful," his legal team said.
"Dominique is devastated about the situation because those children came from the same neighbourhood he did and he will continue to build up his community in any way he can."
The 30-year-old won a Grammy in 2022 for best melodic rap act after featuring on Kanye West's track Hurricane with The Weeknd.
Last year he featured on Central Cee's track Band4Band - it was nominated for a Mobo Award and is in the running to win a Brit for song of the year on Saturday.

Headline: Trump to order English as official US language

Text: Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Friday making English the official language of the United States, according to White House officials.
The US president is also expected to scrap requirements that federal agencies provide language services to non-English speakers.
The US has never had an official language in the nearly 250 years since the country was founded.
The order is intended to improve government efficiency and promote national unity, according to White House officials.
Nearly 68 million of the country's 340 million residents speak a language other than English, according to the US Census Bureau, which includes more than 160 Native American tongues.
Friday's executive order will roll back a policy from 2000 signed by former President Bill Clinton requiring government agencies and federal funding recipients to "ensure that their programs and activities normally provided in English are accessible to LEP (low-English proficiency) persons".
Agencies will still be allowed to provide that language access to non-English speakers, according to White House officials.
Republicans have led efforts in the past to label English as the country's official language, with members of the House as recently as 2021 introducing legislation on it that failed.
Those who opposed those efforts say that the country does not need an official language, pointing to the high numbers of people who speak it and to the country never having one, while also saying establishing one could promote discrimination against non-English speakers.
During his presidential campaign last year, Trump included non-English languages in his statements calling for stricter immigration policies.
"We have languages coming into our country. We don't have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language," he told a crowd of supporters in February 2024.
"It's the craziest thing - they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It's a very horrible thing," he said.
And during the 2016 campaign he said, "This is a country where we speak English. It's English. You have to speak English!"
When the US was founded, most residents spoke English and those writing the country's constitution did not feel it was necessary to enshrine it as the official language and also did not want to alienate fellow new citizens who spoke German or other languages, according to most scholars.
The languages currently spoken the most in the US after English are Spanish, various Chinese languages, Tagolog, Vietnamese and Arabic, according to the Census Bureau.
A further approximately one million people use American Sign Language, according to experts.
Approximately 180 countries around the world designate official national languages, and most countries recognise multiple official languages.
However, several countries besides the US do not have an official language, including the United Kingdom.
There are more than 30 US states which have designated English as the official language, while Alaska and Hawaii have also bestowed official status on several native languages.

Headline: US judge says mass firings of some federal workers likely illegal
Author: Ana Faguy, BBC News, Washington DC
Published Date: 2025-02-28T15:01:53.807Z
Text: A California judge has said the mass firings of probationary employees by the Trump administration were likely unlawful.
The ruling said the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had told thousands of employees across a handful of federal agencies they were fired using authority the agency does not have, US District Judge William Alsup ruled.
"[OPM] does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees at another agency," he said. "They can hire and fire their own employees."
In court the government argued OPM asked, not ordered, the agencies to fire these employees.
They also argued that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.
Government workers have been the target of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce in the name of cutting costs.
Many employees affected by the firings are probationary employees - usually those in their first or second year in a job - though they can sometimes be long-time employees who were recently promoted.
There are some 200,000 probationary employees in the federal workforce.
Judge Alsup ordered OPM to revoke its directives to multiples agencies - including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Defence Department - to terminate employees.
He issued a temporary restraining order which puts a momentary pause on the government's actions until a judge revisits the matter in the coming weeks.
The case began after a coalition of labour unions and non-profit organisations sued the government, arguing OPM unlawfully fired individuals by falsely claiming workers were performing poorly.
Everett Kelley, the National President of the American Federation of Government Employees, called the ruling a victory for Americans were were "illegally fired" from their jobs by an agency with "no authority to do so".
"These are rank-and-file workers who joined the federal government to make a difference in their communities, only to be suddenly terminated due to this administration's disdain for federal employees and desire to privatize their work," he said.
OPM declined the BBC's request for comment.

Headline: 'Trump thinks he can break us' - Ontario's Doug Ford makes bullish victory speech
Author: Nadine Yousif, BBC News, Toronto

Text: The leader of Ontario, Doug Ford, has vowed to push back at US President Donald Trump after securing a third term in office as premier of Canada's most populous province.
"Donald Trump thinks he can break us," he told the cheering crowds in Toronto, but the US president was mistaken, he added. "Canada is not for sale."
Ford, who has led Ontario since 2018, called the snap election to get a clear mandate to fight US President Donald Trump over tariffs he threatens to impose on Canadian goods.
The indications on Friday morning were that his Progressive Conservatives had won more than 80 seats out of 124 in the legislature.
The left-wing New Democratic Party came second, forming the official opposition, while the Liberals were in third place.
Ford pushed back in his election campaign against Trump's persistent references to Canada as the 51st US state, sporting a cap saying "Canada is not for sale."
In his victory speech at a convention centre in Toronto, he said: "Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region.
"Donald Trump doesn't know what we know. He is underestimating us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people, the Canadian spirit."
The election was called by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) 10 minutes after polls closed on Thursday evening.
Voter turnout appears to be near historic lows. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT) with 97% of polls reporting, just over 44% of Ontarians had cast ballots in the election.
That is essentially tied with the lowest ever turnout of 44% in 2022.
Ford ran his campaign under the slogan "Protect Canada", reflecting his view that Canada needs to stand firm against US tariff threats.
Ford has appeared regularly on US television news networks in recent months as a de-facto spokesman for Canada's position in its fight against the tariffs.
President Trump said on Thursday that the tariffs he planned to impose on Canada and Mexico would go ahead next week, after he delayed them a month in exchange for security assurances at the shared borders.
Around 75% of Canadian exports go to the US, and economists have warned that the tariffs would be devastating for Canada's economy while raising costs for Americans.
Ontario is home to a large automotive sector that is deeply intertwined with the US - car parts often make several trips back and forth across the US-Canada border before a vehicle is fully assembled and sold.
Ford has suggested that 500,000 of Ontario's 16 million people could lose their jobs if the US follows through on the blanket 25% tariffs.
He has called for strong retaliation, suggesting Canada cut its energy supply to the US and calling for provincial liquor stores to pull American booze from their shelves.
He has also proposed the idea of "Fortress Am-Can" - a slogan to sell Trump on a stronger energy alliance between the two countries in a bid to avoid tariffs altogether.
Opposition parties have criticised Ford for calling the snap election, accusing him of taking advantage of the rift in US-Canada relations to boost his own popularity. They also questioned the decision to push for a costly election amid economic uncertainty.
Ford has also been the subject of numerous controversies, including an ongoing criminal investigation into a deal to sell a piece of environmentally protected land for real estate development.
At a speech to supporters on Thursday, Bonnie Crombie, leader of the Ontario Liberals, said that while the party fell short of forming a government it should be "very proud" of the seats it gained.
"People counted us out. Tonight, you proved them wrong," said Crombie, who failed to win her own seat. She vowed to continue on as leader.
The last time a government in Ontario formed three consecutive majorities was under Leslie Frost, a Progressive Conservative leader who won his third and final term in 1959.

Headline: Hundreds in US climate agency fired in latest cuts
Author: Thomas Mackintosh, BBC News

Text: Hundreds of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) staff have been laid off in the latest development in the Trump's administration's efforts to slash the federal workforce.
Around 880 workers - including weather forecasters - have had their jobs terminated on Thursday, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.
The cuts come as Elon Musk, as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), continues a push to reduce spending through funding cuts and firings.
An NOAA spokesman said the agency would not comment on internal personnel matters.
Prior to Thursday's cuts, the NOAA had about 12,000 staffers across the world, including 6,773 who are scientists and engineers, according to the agency's website.
"We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission," the NOAA spokesman added.
NOAA staffers took to social media to announce they had been swept up by the cuts.
"I was fired from my dream of working at NOAA. I'm so sorry to everyone also affected," climate scientist Zack Labe wrote on X. He said that he had worked on strengthening the agency's machine learning and AI tools.
Californian Democratic Congressman Jared Huffman said people across the US "depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information".
NOAA weather data is used by meteorologists, media organisations, commerical forecasting services and other companies to inform the US public about the weather. The agency produces the latest information on temperature, precipitation, air quality, UV index, humidity and more.
This data is used extensively in the private sector to fuel popular weather services and websites.
"Most or all private weather companies in US (including forecasts that you see on TV or your favorite app) are built directly atop backbone of taxpayer-funded instrumentation, data, predictive modeling, & forecasts provided by NOAA," Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles wrote on X.
The agency has proved essential during periods of extreme weather conditions as well. The National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service - housed under NOAA - create models and notify millions of Americans when and how to respond to severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes.
Huffman lamented the loss of "hundreds of scientists and experts at NOAA" who helped collect infromation that kept the public safe during dangerous weather events.
"Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives," the congressman said.
Miyoko Sakashita, the Center for Biological Diversity's oceans director, said gutting NOAA will "hamstring essential lifesaving" programmes.
The latest developments come days after US government workers faced widespread confusion following conflicting advice over compliance with a Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination.
The message sent to millions of federal employees last Saturday evening came after Musk posted on his social media platform X that government staff would "shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week".
On Sunday, Musk said in some cases "we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks".
In a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to respond explaining their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information.
But, key agencies, including the Departments of Defense (DoD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, the Pentagon and the FBI - now led by Trump appointees -instructed employees to ignore the directive.
Agencies such as the Department of Transportation, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency encouraged their staff to comply, according to reports.
On Wednesday, Musk reiterated the suggestion that a number of federal employees who did not respond to an email requesting a summary of their achievements from the previous week could be "dead" or "not real people", but offered no facts to back it up.
Speaking at Trump's first cabinet meeting, Musk told reporters: "I think that email perhaps was best interpreted as a performance review, but actually it was a pulse check review.
"Do you have a pulse? Do you have a pulse? And two neurons. So if you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email."
Elsewhere on Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.
District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including at the defence department.

Headline: UK looks at Texas supermax prison for ideas to cut overcrowding
Author: Sima Kotecha, Senior UK correspondent•@sima_kotecha, •
Published Date: 2025-02-28T00:00:23.406Z
Text: A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.
A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, "Where you from, ma'am?"
"England."
"Hope you enjoy Estelle," he says.
"Do you?" I ask.
"A lot better than where I was before."
Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.
Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.
The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.
Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.
Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.
No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.
Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.
He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.
"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives," he says. "If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison."
Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.
The "good time credit" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.
Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.
Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.
"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life," he says. "I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works."
The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).
The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.
"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007," Ms Mahmood says. "They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s."
She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. "It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime."
The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.
"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007," says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. "And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem."
What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: "To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community."
As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of "diversion programmes" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.
More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.
Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.
"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work," Ms Mahmood says.
It's a plan with "huge potential in the UK" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.
"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims," he says.
But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.
Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.
"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time," she says. "It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong."
It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding – and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?
The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.

Headline: Migrant dies during attempt to cross English Channel

Text: A migrant has died during an attempt to cross the Channel in a small boat from northern France to England, French maritime authorities have said.
The Kuwati migrant, in his sixties, suffered a cardiac arrest on the boat that was carrying him and other migrants on Saturday, the Pas-de-Calais prefecture said in a statement.
The boat returned to the beach and the man but despite the efforts of police and medics was declared dead at the scene, it added.
He is the sixth person to have died while attempting to cross the Channel this year.
The boat set off from Calais in northern France on Saturday morning and "very quickly returned to the beach with a person in cardio-respiratory arrest on board," the French maritime prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea told AFP.
"This boat set off again once it had dropped off the people who wanted to disembark on the beach," it added.
Authorities said the boat was "quite heavily loaded" but did not say how many people were on board.
Home Office figures show that more than 1,600 migrants have crossed the Channel in small boats in the past week, with 51 people arriving on Friday alone.
3,720 people have made the crossing to date this year, an increase of 11% on the same period last year.
A record number of migrants died while attempting to make the dangerous crossing in 2024.
According to the Office for the Fight against Illicit Trafficking of Migrants (Oltim), 78 people died while trying to reach England aboard small boats last year, the highest number since the first crossing in 2018.
The UK and France have ramped up efforts to stop Channel crossings, including intensifying patrols on French beaches, intercepting small boats and apprehending the smugglers who organise the crossings.
In a statement on Friday, the Home Office said: "We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security.
"The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay. We will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice."
On 27 February, home secretary Yvette Cooper met her French counterpart, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, to agree a raft of measures aimed at tackling people-smuggling gangs.
These include a new specialist intelligence and judicial police unit in Dunkirk to speed up the arrest and prosecution of people-smugglers and training drone pilots to help intercept boats before they reach the sea.
French authorities will stop migrants on land but not once they take to the sea.

Headline: King's Commonwealth message of unity in 'uncertain times'

Text: King Charles is to call for unity and building bridges in what he describes as "these uncertain times" of international tension, in a message to mark Commonwealth Day next week.
In the annual message to mark the day on Monday, the King will emphasise the value of nations coming together in a "spirit of support, and crucially, friendship".
The King has become involved in the diplomatic negotiations involving the UK, the US and Ukraine - with the monarch warmly welcoming President Volodymyr Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader's disastrous meeting with US President Donald Trump and with a state visit planned for Trump.
A Commonwealth country, Canada, also faces its own tensions with Trump's administration, as he has called for Canada to become the US 51st state.
Commonwealth Day is traditionally marked with a service at Westminster Abbey and this year the King and Queen will attend alongside the Prince and Princess of Wales.
In his message, the King will say: "In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship."
It is a message that he has made before - that the diversity of peoples and cultures is a strength and not a weakness.
But it is a message now against a backdrop of global tensions, as the US pushes for an end to the war that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
As well as a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian President Zelensky, the King this week held a meeting with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, a Commonwealth leader who has faced pressure from the US.
King Charles is Canada's head of state and ahead of the meeting Trudeau said: "Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation."
The King used the Commonwealth, with its 56-member nations, as an example of co-operation between countries.
"The Commonwealth's ability to bring together people from all over the world has stood the test of time and remains as ever-important today," says the King's message.
The service at Westminster Abbey on Monday will emphasise the multicultural diversity of the Commonwealth, with the royal guests being met by a pipe band from a Hindu eco-temple in north-west London.
There will be music from an African arts group, the Masai Cultural Arts team.
And singer Joan Armatrading will perform a version of her song, Love and Affection.
An innovation for this year's Commonwealth Day has been that the King has prepared his own personal playlist of favourite music tracks, by artists including Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue and Raye.

Text: Saturday was the warmest day of the year so far across the UK, with temperatures topping 19.1C in Bridgefoot, England.
This weekend will see "fine and sunny" skies for much of the UK, with some spots expected to be warmer than popular European holiday destinations.
And the warm conditions will continue into Sunday, where temperatures in parts of central England could reach up to 20C.
But the Met Office warned that temperatures will drop next week, with cloud and rain expected to come in from the north.
Saturday was also the warmest day of the year for each nation. Scotland recorded a high of 18.3C in Threave, while Northern Ireland hit 17C in Castlederg.
Wales saw its joint warmest day of the year, matching Thursday's recording of 18.2, with Saturday's temperature in Porthmadog.
"It'll be more of the same and for the majority of the country it will be a similar day to Saturday," Mr Snell said, explaining that it will be "a warm weekend, particularly for the time of year".
Holiday hotspots such as Marbella in Spain or Italy's Amalfi Coast - which are known for their sunny climates - could record lower temperatures than in the warmest parts of the UK.
Marbella on Spain's south coast, has a forecasted high of 15C this weekend, Ibiza is forecasted 17C, and Sorrento on the Amalfi Coast, could reach a high of 18C.
Thursday was previously the warmest day of the year so far in England, Wales and Scotland with 19C recorded in Santon Downham in Suffolk and 18.2C in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion. The Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh reached 16.8C which is the highest on record for it this early in the year.
But temperatures in the UK are expected to drop next week, in what Mr Snell described as "a bit of a shock to the system".
"We're expecting to see some cloud and rain coming in from the north and it will generally be much cooler."
In the meantime, make the most of the warmth this weekend and check the forecast for your local area on the BBC Weather website and app.

Headline: UK troops may need to protect peace in Ukraine for 'many years'
Author: Jessica Rawnsley, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-08T15:01:29.623Z
Text: A former national security adviser has warned the potential deployment of UK troops to protect peace in Ukraine could last for "many years".
Lord Sedwill told the BBC's The Week in Westminster that the UK would need to be "willing to display strategic patience to give the Ukrainians the [security] assurances they need" in the event of a peace deal.
Both the UK and France have said they would be willing to send troops to work to uphold any ceasefire in Russia's war with Ukraine.
They would form part of a "coalition of the willing" to help Kyiv which the UK said could involve around 20 other countries. Not all would necessarily send troops but could provide other support.
The plan, spearheaded by the UK and France, was set out at a summit hosted by the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer last weekend.
No information was provided on which countries had shown an interest in offering support or what that support could specifically involve, but the group is believed to consist of European and Commonwealth countries.
Downing Street said that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese committed to "consider contributing" to the coalition in a phone call on Saturday with Sir Keir.
Norway's foreign minister Espen Barth Eide said the country would be "happy to contribute in one way or the other", but was not yet able to commit to specific support.
In an interview on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, he said: "I think we should not put the cart before the horse, because we need to make sure that we define what is there to defend, whether it will be a peace agreement."
Asked whether the country would consider sending troops to Ukraine, he said: "I don't think many countries have actually [decided] about what exactly we will do in practice, because we need to know what is it that is there to be secured first."
Lord Sedwill said if Russia believed it could just "wait us out" while UK troops were deployed in Ukraine, then any effort to protect a peace deal would not succeed.
"So we have to be willing to sustain such an effort for potentially quite a long period, could be many years," he added.
It comes as concerns mount over US President Donald Trump's approach to the conflict, after he paused military aid to Ukraine, as well as intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery in an apparent bid to bring Ukraine's President Zelensky to the negotiating table.
Russian officials have rejected the idea of peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, with foreign minister Sergei Lavrov previously saying such a move "can't be allowed" as it would amount to the "direct, official and unveiled involvement of Nato members in the war against Russia".
On Friday, Russian MP and TV presenter Yevgeny Popov told BBC Newsnight that the prospect of UK soldiers in Ukraine was "unacceptable" and warned that "British troops will be direct targets for our missiles, you will get coffins in return".
In recent weeks, European leaders have committed to bolstering defence and increase military spending.
At a summit in Brussels on Thursday, EU leaders backed plans to jointly borrow €150bn to lend to EU governments to boost military capabilities.
Sir Keir welcomed the "historic" move as "another sign of Europe stepping up".
A meeting set to take place in Paris next week would be an "important moment to drive forward planning", Downing Street said.
The UK also said it would work with French President Emmanuel Macron, alongside President Zelensky, to draw up a peace plan to present to Trump.
Lord Sedwill, who was cabinet secretary under Theresa May and Boris Johnson, said it was a moment "for a reset" of Nato with European nations showing that they are "willing to step up and share the burden".
He added that Nato "is in pretty good health", particularly with the recent addition of Finland and Sweden, "two really significant military powers".
Rose Gottemoeller, deputy secretary general of Nato during Trump's first term, said she was "admiring" of Europe's recent response in supporting Kyiv.
"They are really taking a lot of responsibility for moving forward in their own defence as well as the defence of Ukraine," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.
If Europe can step up, Lord Sedwill added, "then we can convince the Americans that this remains an institution which actually helps protect their security as well as European security and thus to remain invested in it".
Former Conservative defence secretary Ben Wallace said that it would not be "the end of the world" if the US pulled out of Nato and that Europe should be looking at how it can replace satellite imagery and other technology pulled from Ukraine by the US.
"We have the will in Europe and the money if we choose to fix our own security and defence," he told the Today programme.
Many Western leaders have said that it would only be possible to uphold a lasting peace in Ukraine with the help of the US.
Sir Keir previously said that a plan for defence should be made "in conjunction with the United States... it's that ability to work with the United States and our European partners that has kept the peace for 80 years now".
Trump has so far avoided committing to such support, and has suggested that the presence of US workers in Ukraine as part of a potential minerals deal could act as a security guarantee.

Headline: Sports event 'celebrates strong female veterans'

Text: A veteran who has set up a series of sporting events dedicated to women who have served in the armed forces has said sport was a "lifeline" when she was medically discharged.
Gemma Kemble-Stephenson signed up at the age of 17 and served as a medic in the Royal Army Medical Corps for 18 years.
After suffering a spinal injury in 2018, she found taking part in adaptive sports through the Help the Heroes charity was a big part of her recovery and the difficult transition to civilian life.
She now works for the charity and is leading its first female-only series of sports taster sessions in Liverpool this weekend to "celebrate strong women" who have served.
The event, at Liverpool John Moores University, is part of the charity's drive to encourage more female veterans to get active.
It will offer a number of adaptive sports taster sessions including netball, yoga, power-lifting, boccia, and rowing.
The charity said Kemble-Stephenson, the current World's Strongest Disabled Woman and a para powerlifter and indoor rower, was an inspiration to other women looking to reignite their passion for sport.
Kemble-Stephenson, from Neath, Wales, said: "We know the power of sport to your mental and physical wellbeing.
"Many women join the armed forces because they enjoy being active... but when they leave that outlet can be taken away from them."
She said it would be a "safe space" for women "to dip their toe back in the water and try out a range of different sports".
"They will be able to connect with like-minded people, too," she added.
The 43-year-old said women are set to travel from all over the country to take part, adding that when the weekend was over they would "go home feeling positive and energised".
The charity has a programme of sports and social activities for former service personnel as part of its recovery programme.
The community sports series was launched three years ago but the charity hopes this latest event is the first of many held exclusively for women.
Kemble-Stephenson added: "The majority of people take part just for the fun, but we have had some people go on to complete our coaching academy course and represent their country at Invictus Games, Paralympics and Commonwealth competitions."

Headline: Man beat girlfriend and forced her to hide bruises

Published Date: 2025-03-07T18:49:32.718Z
Text: A man who repeatedly punched his girlfriend before forcing her to hide the bruises has been jailed for two years and nine months.
Michael Keane, 38, began to verbally abuse his partner one month into their relationship before carrying out a campaign of physical abuse that lasted six months.
Douglas Courthouse heard at one point he placed a mattress against the front door of her flat to make it difficult for her to leave.
Passing sentence, Deemster Graeme Cook said he had subjected the "vulnerable" woman to "appalling" and "degrading" treatment.
The court heard the couple had met in October 2023 on a night out.
While they had initially divided their time between Keane's home in Liverpool and hers on the island, he went on to move in with her.
The court was told Keane had begun verbally abusing the victim within three weeks of them meeting, and started regularly hitting her in November that year.
He would then refuse to let her leave the flat until she covered up the bruises he had given her, the court was told.
After being punched in the face by Keane on one occasion in April 2023, she "crept out" of the flat and called her sister, who encouraged her to report him to the police, the hearing was told.
Keane was arrested, and later broke his bail conditions by letting himself into the woman's flat without permission and sending her threatening messages.
In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said she had never imagined someone that she thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with "could hurt me in this way".
Keane pleaded guilty to committing domestic abuse between 1 November 2023 to 4 May 2024.
Deemster Cook said the victim was an "extremely vulnerable young person" who had trusted him.
The deemster imposed a restraining order forbidding Keane from contacting or approaching the victim, and an exclusion order banning him from the island for five years after his release.

Headline: Bulgarians guilty of spying for Russia in the UK
Author: Daniel De Simone, Investigations correspondent, Amy Walker, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-07T17:59:37.877Z
Text: Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as "one of the largest" foreign intelligence operations in the UK.
Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023.
While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps.
The methods they used were the sort of thing you would "expect to see in a spy novel", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy.
Gaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents.
They were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.
Here police found a "treasure trove" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment.
They also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his "minions", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise.
Roussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial.
The cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018.
As part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as "hooked and in love" with her in WhatsApp messages.
Another operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022.
During the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was "sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information".
The police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity.
Met counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an "extremely sophisticated" operation that "posed a threat to national security and individuals".
Roussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard.
The Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an "intermediary for the Russian intelligence services".
Roussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations.
Roussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm.
Stoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname "The Destroyer".
Dzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on "British values".
But Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova – they were found in bed together when police made arrests – and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past.
During their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia.
Ivanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested. He was arrested a year after the other five defendants and told police he had several conversations with MI5.
The prosecution case focused on six operations carried out by the spies:
Operation 1
This targeted the Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev.
Marsalek and Roussev exchanged messages discussing their options in relation to Mr Grozev, including the placing of team members in seats next to him on planes. He was followed throughout Europe and properties connected to him were watched in Austria and Bulgaria.
The spy cell also discussed potentially robbing him of his laptop and phone and taking it to the Russian Embassy, burning his property, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, or killing him.
Operation 2
This targeted journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian national.
The cell followed him in various countries, and discussed kidnapping him in the UK and smuggling him out of the country using a small boat.
At one stage, Ivanova was so close to him on a plane that she could see the Pin code for his phone.
Operation 3
This targeted a man called Bergey Ryskaliyev in November 2021, the court heard.
Mr Ryskaliyev is a Kazakhstan national and former politician. He fled to the United Kingdom where he was later granted asylum.
There is and was a clear motive for Russia to develop relations with Kazakhstan, the court heard.
Prosecutors said that targeting a political dissident on behalf of Kazakhstan cultivates those relations by providing Kazakhstan with what it might consider to be assistance.
Operation 4
This involved plans for disruptive activity at the Kazakh embassy in London in September 2022.
The court heard that the plan was to stage a demonstration outside the embassy - a "fake protest" - to create a pretence that they were in possession of genuine intelligence about those responsible, which they would then pass on to the Kazakhstan intelligence to try to gain favour with Kazakhstan on behalf of Russia.
Operation 5
This involved surveillance at the Patch Barracks, a US Military Base in Stuttgart in late 2022.
This is a US military airbase, which jurors heard was believed by the defendants to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained in the use of surface to air weapons, at the very time of Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
Prosecutors say the defendants' plan was to target the airbase using a range of highly sophisticated technology designed to capture key intelligence about those present on the base.
Operation 6
Jurors were told this plan was targeting a man called Kirill Kachur.
He is a Russian national who spent time in Montenegro who was employed by the Investigative Committee of Russia but left the country in 2021 and was designated as a "foreign agent" by Russia in November 2023.

Headline: Hundreds of horses rescued in memory of animal lover
Author: Nicola Bryan, Reporting fromBBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-07T06:08:55.184Z
Text: Ginny Hajdukiewicz died more than 30 years ago but her legacy lives on, meaning the lives of animals continue to be saved.
Ginny was 38 when she died in 1994 after being diagnosed with breast cancer but since then the charity she started has gone on to rescue almost 400 horses and ponies.
"She was my heroine, I was in absolute awe of her and I wanted to be just like her," said Dionne Schuurman, who was taught to ride by Ginny as a nine-year-old.
Dionne, who is now operations manager at Ginny's charity Lluest Horse and Pony Trust in Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, said Ginny would be incredibly proud as it turns 40.
"She was just one small person and I think her story deserves to be heard," said her friend Stella Gratrix, who was one of the charity's first trustees.
"She was a powerful force at 4ft 11."
Aged 23, Ginny set up her first riding centre in Coombe, Gloucestershire.
Barbara Metcalfe met her for the first time when she took her then five-year-old daughter along to learn to ride.
She said it was immediately clear Ginny was "absolutely devoted to her horses".
"She was somebody who cared deeply about the horses and not at all about the money she was going to make," she said.
Barbara then began volunteering at the centre and a close friendship was formed.
Ginny made a similar impression on Stella, who got to know her when she later moved to Wales in 1982 and set up in Trefenter in Ceredigion.
"Ginny survived on bread and potatoes one winter because all of her money went on to buy fodder for the horses, she was totally dedicated," she said.
"Her motto was 'every penny possible for the ponies'."
She also remembers Ginny for her strong language.
"A typical horsey lady," she laughed.
When Ginny founded the charity in 1985, Stella, Barbara and Barbara's late husband Brian were made trustees.
She wanted to create a refuge and safe haven for ponies and horses after being appalled by the condition and handling of wild hill ponies and foals she saw at local horse sales.
"We used to go to the horse sales with a camera and it was obviously known what we were doing and we'd have ice cold water chucked over us in February," said Stella.
"Ponies would be slipping and sliding because the floor wasn't clean," added Barbara.
"It was nothing really to see a foal, perhaps nervous after being taken from its mother, whacked across the back with a stick and then slip and slide all over the slippery floor."
The charity was formed and in her lifetime Ginny rescued 77 horses and helped many more.
She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992.
Towards the end of her life she had a surprise reunion with 22 of the ponies she had rescued over the years, all of them happy, fit and thriving in their loan homes.
She died at her home on 13 September 1994 following a stroke and is buried on the farm alongside her beloved pony Prince.
Today the charity, which is still funded entirely by donations, has rescued more than 450 horses and ponies.
It employs three full-time and two part-time grooms and welcomes volunteers throughout the year.
A recent success story is Jack Sparrow, a foal who was rescued after being found alone in a drainage ditch along the sea wall in Peterstone, Newport, last July.
He was the third orphan foal the charity took in during 2024 but sadly the only one to survive.
Another success story is Connie.
During the Covid pandemic in 2020, the charity received a call from a walker to say they had discovered a foal trying to feed from its dead mother close to the charity in Llangadog.
Their team had to carry the foal over fences by torchlight before taking her back to the farm for an assessment by vets and feeding her replacement foal milk every two hours through the night.
Today she is a happy, healthy five-year-old.
Ginny was a keen writer, often writing about her life and work in notebooks or even on the back of envelopes.
To coincide with the charity's 40th birthday, Stella and Barbara have collected and edited her handwritten stories.
The result is a book - Ginny's story of the Lluest Horse and Pony Trust.
Barbara and Stella, who both met Ginny when they were in their 30s and are now in their 70s, said she continued to impact their lives.
"I think she gave me a lot of confidence by doing what I did for her and the trust," said Barbara.
"It enriched my life and I've still got a huge respect for her and what she did."
"Ditto," said Stella. "I still walk up to her grave and say hello."
What would Ginny make of her legacy?
"I saw [Ginny's husband] Peter the other day and he said she would be so proud," said Barbara.
"That was his words, he said 'Ginny would be so proud'."

Headline: Northern NHS trusts have fewest overseas workers
Author: Megan Paterson, Reporting fromBBC North East and Cumbria

Text: Health services across the North East and Cumbria have the lowest number of NHS staff recruited from overseas in England, according to NHS figures.
One in five NHS England staff registered a nationality other than British last year, but in the North East and Cumbria it was about one in 10.
The data comes as concerns have been raised about over reliance on international workers within the NHS.
Katha Deguzman, a Filipino ward sister at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, said working in the UK had been "incredibly fulfilling".
The number of overseas workers in the North East and Cumbria is the lowest in the country and puts the region within the NHS long term international recruitment aim of between nine and 11% of health service staff.
Doctor and nursing roles had the highest percentage of non-British staff members in the area.
Miss Deguzman, who moved to the UK in 2018, said she was "really worried and scared" about coming to England to work but had since found a second family in her friendly colleagues and patients.
"It was a really friendly hospital," the spinal injury ward nurse said, adding: "I felt like [the patients] would worry because I'm not from here, but I get all the trust of my patients which I'm truly grateful for.
"It's fulfilling for me, being able to extend my help to care for them."
The region has a lower percentage of non-White British residents compared to the rest of the country.
The last census in 2021 found 90% of people in the North East and 95% of people in Cumbria were White British, compared to 81% nationally.
Despite the lower than average number of overseas employees, international workers remain significant to NHS provision in the region.
At South Tyneside And Sunderland NHS Trust, 18% are non-British, the highest number in the region.
The North East and Cumbria Integrated Care Board had the lowest number at 2%, while at the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 11% of staff are non-British.
Debi McKeown, the nursing workforce lead at James Cook, said understanding local dialect could at times be tricky for new recruits but the high level of clinical skills was key in "sustaining a really healthy workforce".
She said: "We absolutely had a gap in our workforce here and being able to bring in international nurses has enhanced what we can provide to patients.
"Overseas nurses were really crucial to help us provide safe care to patients."

Headline: The King reveals his playlist, from Marley to Kylie

Text: King Charles III is launching a personal playlist of music that lifts his spirits and brings back important memories, including Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue and Grace Jones.
He was photographed at Buckingham Palace for the music project, named the King's Music Room, with an "on air" sign on the desk of the royal DJ.
A video trailer shows the band for the changing of the guard outside the palace playing Bob Marley's Could You Be Loved, in a project to celebrate music from Commonwealth countries.
"So this is what I particularly wanted to share - songs which have brought me joy," the King said.
"Throughout my life, music has meant a great deal to me," the King says in the video launching the project, which is a partnership with Apple Music.
"I know that is also the case for so many others.
"It has that remarkable ability to bring happy memories flooding back from the deepest recesses of our memory, to comfort us in times of sadness, and to take us to distant places.
"But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration.
"In other words, it brings us joy."
The full choice of tracks, with more royal commentary, will be published on Monday, for Commonwealth Day.
As well as as reggae from Marley and dance music from Minogue, there are expected to be contributions from Nigerian-American singer-songwriter Davido and British singer-songwriter Raye.
The King saw Raye at a concert at a Christmas market at the former Battersea Power Station, where Apple has its London headquarters.
The project is intended to be a different approach to Commonwealth Day, which sees the Royal Family gathering for a service in Westminster Abbey.
It will reflect the King's musical interests through his life, ranging from 1930s crooners to Afrobeat stars.
He is also expected to share anecdotes about some of the artists and reveals why the songs help form the soundtrack to his life.
"This seemed such an interesting and innovative way to celebrate this year's Commonwealth Day," the King said.
He has a longstanding interest in Marley and has visited the singer's former home in Jamaica, which has been turned into a museum.
And outside the palace windows, the band played Marley's message: "Don't let them change ya, oh! Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no!"

Headline: Canal boat crush death was an accident - coroner

Text: The death of a retired pharmacist crushed between a canal boat and dock was an accident, a coroner has concluded.
Margaret Billings, 78, from Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, was on a boating trip with friends and family when she died along the Kennet and Avon Canal, in Devizes, on 27 June last year.
In a written statement, her husband of 51 years, Michael Billings, told Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner's Court they had been on more than 20 trips previously and were experienced - but said he remembered his wife's cry and a splash as she fell into the water.
Police said there were no suspicious circumstances and paramedics - including ones from an air ambulance - had tried to revive Ms Billings.
The couple were on the trip between Bradford on Avon and Devizes when the incident happened.
In the written statement, Mr Billings said they were experienced and confident in the water.
The court heard Ms Billings had been helping to moor the boat at Maton Lock, St Joseph's Place, Devizes.
She went to jump from the boat to the bank, but did not make it. However, the boat kept going forwards, crushing her, the inquest was told.
Mr Billings explained his wife had been standing about 3ft (0.9m) away from him and remembered telling her to wait. "The next thing I heard was a cry and saw splashing water," he said.
"The boat weighed about 20 tonnes and I could see it crushing the life out of Margaret."
He said it had happened very quickly - friends jumped in to pull her put of the water, which was about 4ft (1.2m) deep.
Paramedics arrived within minutes and she was pronounced dead soon after, the hearing was told.
A couple of days beforehand, she told her husband she had torn her achilles tendon and was limping but had been able to keep up when walking.
A post-mortem examination found she died from injuries consistent with being trapped between the boat and the side of the canal.
Area coroner Ian Singleton recorded a conclusion of accidental death.

Headline: Ukrainians share their hopes and fears on the war

Text: Three Ukrainian women with links to the Channel Islands have shared their hopes and fears after recent discussions about trying to end the ongoing war with Russia.
By April 2022 Jersey had welcomed 14 Ukrainian refugees and by March 2023 Guernsey had housed 24 Ukrainians.
There were unprecedented scenes in the White House last Friday when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and JD Vance in front of the world's media.
After the meeting Zelensky was ordered to leave the White House before flying to London where he received a strong show of support from European leaders who are at a Brussels summit to discuss future support for Ukraine.
Natalia Baker, born in Odessa and now living in Jersey, said she would love to see victory for Ukraine and celebrate it in Liberation Square "like how we celebrate the Liberation in Jersey".
While she lives in Jersey, Mrs Baker's family are still in Ukraine.
She said: "We are losing - every day - children, fathers, brothers and mothers so this is tough for us."
Mrs Baker said she believes a ceasefire and peace agreement need to be put in place.
"It doesn't matter that President Zelensky doesn't have a suit - he has a heart," she added.
Valeriya Sarnovska left Kyiv in 2022 and moved to Guernsey for a few years before returning to her home city where she is currently living.
"Every night I hear the sirens, I feel completely empty," she said.
"There are almost no families that have lost no-one to the war."
She said if Ukraine loses international support it "will disappear and our kids are going to read about Ukraine only in books".
She added that Ukraine needed military help and said that she hoped European pressure would help lead to a resolution.
Olga Turkoglu, 36, moved to Guernsey in November 2017.
She said: "Every day we wake up and read the news in the hope that something better has happened."
She said "so many" Ukrainians were uncertain about their future but added that her voluntary work for the Humanitarian Aid Guernsey charity gives her a sense of calm when she feels helpless.
She said: "We have cards and our cards are our people and our friends.
"The UK is a good friend and has our back.
"It kind of looks like it's hopeless but knowing that we have those cards gives us hope.
"We stopped the full-scale invasion in 2022, we didn't let Kyiv fall and we still have the belief that we will not stop and we will continue fighting."

Headline: 'Depraved and cowardly' rapist may have attacked 50 more women
Author: Daniel Sandford, UK correspondent•@BBCDanielS, •
Published Date: 2025-03-05T14:34:27.776Z
Text: Warning: This article contains distressing details and descriptions of rape
When he was arrested in January 2024, serial rapist Zhenhao Zou was living on the 39th floor of an expensive block of London flats with views across the city.
A PhD student from China, he had been studying at University College London (UCL) and was paying more than £4,000 a month in rent.
Police found his bedroom had been equipped with hidden cameras and discovered a wardrobe stocked with alcohol, ecstasy and an industrial chemical that the human body turns into the "date rape" drug GHB. He had a pipette for carefully measuring doses of the dangerous liquid.
But detectives also found 1,277 videos on his electronic devices. At least some were filmed by Zou showing him raping unconscious women.
The footage had been filmed in both the UK and China. Police were able to charge him with multiple assaults on women in both countries - including the rapes of women who have never come forward and have never been identified.
During his trial at Inner London Crown Court, jurors had to watch footage found on Zou's devices of nine of the rapes. Zou, now 28, claimed he had been sleeping with five different women a month and taking cocaine, ketamine, ecstasy and what he called "liquid E" - the "date rape" drug GHB.
He admitted that having sex with unconscious women was one of his fantasies, but he claimed the women in the videos found on his phone and cameras were "acting" - helping, he claimed, to bring his rape fantasies to life in exchange for money and gifts.
However, the jury ultimately decided he was a serial rapist who had been drugging young women and filming the attacks.
Zou has now been found guilty of 11 rapes of 10 different women - two who have been identified and another eight who have yet to be traced - across two different continents.
Detectives say they fear he may have raped as many as 50 more women.
"This man may well turn out to be one of the most prolific sexual predators that we've ever seen in this country," Commander Kevin Southworth, from the Metropolitan Police, told the BBC.
Many of the women he raped were completely unconscious. One - who we are calling Ms L - said she woke up to find Zou raping her before she drifted back into unconsciousness. Another - who we are calling Ms N - only discovered Zou had secretly filmed himself raping her when detectives found the video in his flat, eight months after she had first reported him.
"I think he is a devious and Machiavellian individual," Commander Southworth told the BBC.
He said Zou would meet women socially, or through social media, and then take them back to his flat where he would ply them with drink laced with drugs.
"He would commit those sexual assaults while they're incapacitated and possibly even while they're asleep and completely unaware," added Commander Southworth.
Zou - who comes from Dongguan City, in southern China, close to Hong Kong - grew up in a wealthy family who owned several properties in China and were able afford the hefty fees for his higher education in the UK. His nickname was Pakho, the name some of the women he later raped knew him by.
At the age of 20 he moved to Northern Ireland to finish the final two years of his mechanical engineering degree at Queen's University, Belfast (QUB).
In September 2019, he then moved to London to study a Masters in mechanical engineering at UCL, but returned to China the following year during the Covid-19 pandemic.
While there, in November 2020, he used an obscure messaging app to download what amounted to an instruction manual on how to drug and rape young women. One advert police found on his phone had the words "effects guaranteed" splashed across pictures of sleeping, naked women.
On his telephone police also found seven videos of him raping women in China. They were referred to in court as Females B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Five of the women looked completely unconscious in the videos. One, Female G, appeared to wake briefly while Zou was raping her, but struggled to maintain consciousness. Female H could be heard snoring.
Another woman, Female D, was unconscious when the rape began but came round and repeatedly told Zou "please, no", while trying to fight him off. The videos were so disturbing that the judge, Rosina Cottage KC, made sure the jurors watched them as little as possible. Detectives have not been able to track down the women in China.
Although some of his victims were raped in China, Zou could be put on trial in the UK because he was resident here.
Saira Pike, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was important to bring justice for the unknown females who Zou could be seen raping in videos.
"It was really important that we fight for them," she said. "I was determined to go forward with that and not use the fact that we couldn't identify the females as a deterrent from getting justice for them."
But Zou did not only rape women in China.
Two of the most distressing videos showed the rape of Female A at Zou's student accommodation in Bloomsbury, central London. Police have never been able to establish who Female A is, and it is unclear if she was raped before or after Zou's trip to China during the pandemic.
At the start of the first video, Female A was seen to be unconscious, but woke and pleaded with Zou to stop. "I hate you," she can be heard saying.
"It's pointless," Zou replied. "The sound insulation here is very good."
The second video is similar. Both had been filmed on a tiny spy camera the size of a thumb, placed on a shelf on the other side of the room.
When detectives first found the videos they could not extract the sound. At first Zou insisted the woman in the video was fully consenting to sex. But just before the trial, detectives managed to recover the sound, showing Female A was clearly under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and that she was begging him to stop.
Zou then changed his story, telling the jury it was "rape role play" and the young woman had been acting.
"Zou is plainly a depraved and cowardly individual who's preyed on his victim survivors in the most despicable manner," Commander Southworth said.
Police have never been able to trace Female A. However, two women did give evidence against Zou during the trial.
Ms N, a young Chinese student, described how she first met Zou in May 2023. He had been helping her with maths. A few days later, they both went to a party at another flat in his luxury block, the UNCLE building, in Elephant and Castle. After the party, he persuaded her to go back to his flat where he plied her with drinks.
The court heard Zou then dragged her into his bedroom where he raped her.
Some of their conversation in the flat was recorded on a spy camera beside Zou's bed, which was triggered by a motion sensor.
"Finish the drink," Zou kept saying on the video. "Finish the drink. It should not be wasted."
Ms N does not remember much after drinking the large glass of vodka. She reported the rape to the police soon afterwards, but unsure of the law, and she says discouraged by the officers' response - including a poor translation of her 999 call - she decided not to pursue the allegation.
The Metropolitan Police have said it was regretful victims did not get the best translation. "There is undoubtedly some learning from the first response that these victims received," Commander Southworth added.
Eight months after Ms N first spoke to police, detectives contacted her again, telling her they had found the videos of Zou plying her with drink, and photographs on his phone showing her being raped.
Ms N was so upset about her ordeal that she also posted on the Chinese social media app Red Note (Xiaohongshu) warning other women about Zou. This was spotted by another woman - Ms L - who replied and said she had had a similar experience.
Ms L said she met Zou when she was 19, in August 2021. They had consensual sex a couple of times and had agreed to meet up with friends at a restaurant in London's Chinatown. The group moved onto a private room at another restaurant, drinking several bottles of Jack Daniel's. She has little memory of what happened after, but she ended up at Zou's Bloomsbury flat.
"When I woke up I found him on top of me having sex," she said.
When they searched Zou's flat after his arrest, police found four spy cameras.
The court heard they also found a yellow Fendi "trophy box" in the wardrobe containing jewellery and clothing which police think may have belonged to women he raped.
Police have not found any phones, computers or cameras from his time in Belfast so they do not know if his campaign of drug rape had already begun while he was studying there.
UCL said Zou was suspended on 27 January 2024 and he stopped studying there "as soon we were informed about the allegations".
The university said its online portal was available for students and staff affected by the case and that it was supporting the police appeal.
Zou was found guilty of 11 charges of raping 10 women, three counts of voyeurism, three counts of possessing a controlled drug with intent to rape, and one count of false imprisonment.
The jury found him not guilty of charges of possessing MDMA, Ketamine and Xanax with intent to rape. They also found him not guilty of two charges of possessing extreme pornography depicting rape.
Commander Southworth added: "We have video evidence of as many as potentially 50 further victim survivors who we are desperate to trace so that we can establish what has happened to them."
"Such is the insidious nature of this offending, I think there is a possibility that many more victim survivors may not even know that he has raped them," he added.
Detectives are asking any woman who may have spent any time alone with Zou - whether in China or in the UK - to come forward.

Headline: Russian warship tracked near British waters
Author: Adam Hale, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-05T14:10:06.585Z
Text: The Royal Navy has released images of a Russian warship which it tracked sailing near British waters.
The corvette Boikiy was part of a task group which was tracked by HMS Somerset for three days as it made its way through the English Channel and North Sea, escorting a merchant vessel on its return from Syria to Russia.
Patrol aircraft and Nato forces also assisted with the monitoring operation, the navy said.
Boikiy is one of several Russian vessels to have been tracked sailing near the British coast in recent months.
The Royal Navy said its operation began on Saturday as the Russian warship headed south through the North Sea and English Channel to meet the merchant vessel, known as Baltic Leader, to escort it back to Russia.
Somerset, a British Type 23 frigate, used its radar system to report on the movements and a Merlin helicopter from its naval air squadron was also launched to gather information from the sky.
The Russian merchant ship was transporting military hardware from the Russian naval base in Tartus, Syria, with crew on the accompanying warship seen burning papers and manning the ship's machine guns, the Times reported.
BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery and found the Baltic Leader docked in Tartus on 1 February. At the time, its publicly-available tracker was turned off, according to ship tracking site MarineTraffic.
It is not possible to see what is on the ship, but imagery shows a number of containers and other items on the dock nearby.
According to shipping database Equasis, the owner of the Baltic Leader is Russian shipping company MG-Flot LLC - which was sanctioned by the UK government after being accused of helping Russia to destabilise Ukraine.
In 2022, the vessel was also sanctioned by the US due to its links to Russian lender Promsvyazbank, one of the Russian entities targeted by the US and European countries in the aftermath of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The ship's commanding officer, Cdr Joel Roberts, said: "Somerset is well-versed in the escort of Russian ships, having conducted these operations on a number of occasions.
"Great professionalism has been shown by the ship's company to remain vigilant whilst operating in UK waters and integrating with our Nato allies to monitor Russian activity around Europe."
It is the second time this year that Somerset has been used to track Russian activity off the British coast.
The operation comes two weeks after the navy monitored five ships, including three merchant vessels, as they sailed for a Russian Baltic port from Syria.
And in January, Defence Secretary John Healey told MPs the Royal Navy had monitored a Russian spy ship after it was spotted around UK waters - accusing the vessel, Yantar, of being used to gather intelligence and map the UK's underwater infrastructure.
He said the incident was "another example of growing Russian aggression", in claims which were described as "absolutely baseless" by the Russian embassy in London.
Western nations have often tracked Yantar operating in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables.
Russia has been accused of stepping up this activity since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Headline: Woman died climbing on mountain rocks - inquest

Text: A 28-year-old woman died after falling about 65ft from Tryfan mountain in Eryri National Park, an inquest has heard.
Maria Rosanova Eftimova, a structural civil engineer, from St Helens, Merseyside, slipped while attempting to climb rocks with friends on 22 February.
Coroner Kate Roberston stated that despite rescue crews and paramedics attending the scene, Ms Eftimova died before she could be taken to hospital.
In a tribute, Victoria Critchley, said she was "ambitious, bright and cherished, whose vibrant personality, energy and aura touched and uplifted all around her".
Tryfan is one of the highest mountains in Eryri National Park – and is often described as a peak that marks the line between hiking and mountaineering and is difficult to navigate in a traditional manner, especially in poor weather.
With no marked footpaths to the summit, it requires using hands and scrambling skills to reach the top.
It was used as a training ground to test oxygen equipment and safety techniques before the first ever successful climb of Everest in 1953.
Chris Lloyd, chairman of Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation, said people should "check the weather forecast and make sure you are suitable equipped" before venturing on the mountains.
At the opening of the inquest in Caernarfon on Wednesday, Ms Robertson said Ms Eftimova had attempted to reach a ledge for a handhold to lift herself up, but her heel slipped, which caused her to fall a "considerable distance".
A post mortem examination showed that Ms Eftimova, who is originally from Sofia, in Bulgaria, had suffered severe head injuries, including a fractured skull.
She added: "I send my sincere condolences to all Maria Eftimova's family and friends."
The inquest was adjourned to be continued at a future date.

Headline: More funding for judges to tackle record court delays

Text: Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.
The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.
Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.
The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.
There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.
Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.
The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.
Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.
She said a cap on sitting days had a "drastic effect", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.
A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was "unprecedented", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.
"The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise," she told the Today programme.
"We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts," she added.
But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.
Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt "out of reach" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.
One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.
Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under "immense pressure" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.
"With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support," she said.
"I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first."
Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had "accepted" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.
The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.
Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: "Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned."
Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.
"We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years."
Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of "queues for justice" were "unacceptable".
"This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long," she told the BBC's Today programme.
She added that the state of courtrooms were in "a pretty dire way", and funding was also needed for upkeep.
"There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial," she said.

Text: There will be a four-day celebration of the 80th anniversary of VE Day, including a flypast, concert and a Westminster Abbey service, the government has announced.
The commemorations, marking 80 years since the end of World War Two in Europe, will run from the Bank Holiday Monday on 5 May, until 8 May.
Veterans will be joining the events, with only a shrinking number of that generation able to attend in what will be among the last major wartime commemorations involving those who served.
"People across society will be able to hear our veterans' stories first hand, to reflect and remember," Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said.
And it would be an opportunity to "pay tribute to all those who served in the Second World War and to reflect on the values that they were fighting for".
Ruth Bourne, 98, who worked at the wartime code-breaking base in Bletchley Park, Bucks, will be taking part in the commemorations.
She remembers how the war had ended and VE Day celebrations were held on 8 May 1945, when the Nazi regime in Germany had been defeated.
"There was an electric buzz among everyone and eventually the royals came out and waved, and we cheered like crazy waving whatever we had on us," Ruth says.
"People climbed on every available lamppost, lit bonfires in Hyde Park and we sat around singing songs.
"Not many went to bed that night."
Defence Secretary John Healey said: "The freedoms we enjoy today were defended by our remarkable Second World War generation.
"Our duty today is to safeguard the British values they sacrificed so much to uphold."
Tara Knights, of the Royal British Legion, said: "We will be running educational and community engagement programmes to encourage everyone to get involved in this momentous occasion."
Arts Council England will also be helping communities and local organisations hold commemorative events.
It is not yet known which international guests might be attending, including whether US President Donald Trump will be part of the ceremonies.
Last year, for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the then US President, Joe Biden, joined commemorations in Normandy, alongside King Charles III, the UK's then prime minister Rishi Sunak, and leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.
The previous VE Day events, marking the 75th anniversary, were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.
For VE Day 80, there will be four days of events:
Later in the year, on 15 August, a service led by the Royal British Legion will be held at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire, to commemorate VJ Day, or Victory in Japan Day, and the end of the war.

Kristofer Alexander Deichler, 46, Jatinder Singh Kamra, 45 and Sukhraj Bir Singh, 38, were charged with harassment without violence between 28 August and 6 September 2024.
They are members of Lighthouse - a group which was the subject of the 2023 podcast and TV documentary A Very British Cult.
All three were arrested in London last September and have been on bail since.
No date has yet been set for a court hearing.
The BBC podcast and TV documentary told the story of Lighthouse International Group – which has since rebranded itself as Lighthouse Global.
The group began as a life coaching organisation led by a man called Paul Waugh.

Headline: Fresh bid for Summerland fire inquest submitted
Author: Ashlea Tracey, BBC News, Isle of Man

Text: A formal application for a fresh inquest into the deaths of 50 people in the 1973 Summerland fire disaster has been submitted to the Isle of Man's Attorney General.
The Justice for Summerland Group, made up of survivors and relatives of victims, has previously called for the original misadventure verdicts to be overturned.
Belfast-based human rights law firm Phoenix Law, representing the families, said it wanted to reopen the case to "ensure a comprehensive investigation" using "modern legal and forensic standards".
The Isle of Man government said the Attorney General's Chambers can confirm that an application has been received and will be given appropriate consideration.
About 3,000 people were at the Summerland entertainment complex, which at the time was one of the biggest indoor leisure complexes in Europe, when a blaze broke out on the evening of 2 August 1973,
It was thought to have been started by three boys from Liverpool smoking.
A public inquiry held in the aftermath found there were "no villains" and only human beings who made mistakes.
However, making its application, Phoenix Law said there had been an "irregularity of proceedings in the original inquest" which had not commented on or addressed "substantial issues" including the cause of the fire.
The firm said there was "substantial fresh evidence which was not heard at the original inquest or commission which call into question the central conclusions", suggesting the forensic analysis of the time was now "unreliable".
A spokesman also said several experts had provided written support for a fresh investigation into the fire "on the premise that there have been significant developments within the forensic science on how fires are investigated".
He said they had pointed to the Stardust Fire, in which 48 young people died in a fire in a north Dublin nightclub in 1981, where "the cause of fire was established many years after the event".
The firm's Darragh Mackin, who last year represented many families affected in the Stardust fire, said the relatives of those killed at Summerland had "raised concerns about the original investigation" for years.
It was "difficult to envisage a more compelling set of circumstances to which point firmly in favour of a fresh investigation", he added.

Headline: All smiles in Meghan's upbeat Netflix series
Author: Sean Coughlan, Royal correspondent
Published Date: 2025-03-04T16:45:57.620Z
Text: Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen.
Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.
We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.
It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with "keepsake packaging").
What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.
"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language," says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.
She makes different types of pasta, crudités, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.
There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt.
"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on," Meghan explains. "So I try to under salt."
Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.
It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.
It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.
Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.
It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.
Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. "Love is in the detail, gang," she says. And "it's time to pop a bottle" for a glass of champagne.
Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.
And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says "Oh my God" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.
It's also appearing for sale as "raspberry spread" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.
Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: "This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making," with picking fruit a "daily task".
The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with "Wildflower honey with honeycomb" going on sale.
We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower "sprinkles" are also part of the new range.
Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.
"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life," said Kaling.
"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special..."'
Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as "it felt like the right thing to do".
We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes "high low" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.
There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.
"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name'," says Meghan.
There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: "I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals." Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.
She's shown wrapping a gift and says: "I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress."
As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.
In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this "new chapter" which is "part of that creativity that I've missed so much".
Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.
Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.
This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.

Text: A regional airline says it will create local job opportunities as it announces its 10th regional base.
Loganair will create the facility at Southampton Airport, generating new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers.
The airline also plans to launch two new routes as well as increasing capacity for one of its existing flights.
Chief executive officer Luke Farajallah said: "We are delighted to be announcing a new base which is a logical and important strategic step for the UK's largest regional airline."
From the 26 October new routes from Southampton to Manchester and Manchester to Exeter have been added to the airline's timetable.
Capacity has also increased from 49 to 72 passengers on the Southampton to Edinburgh route.
New routes via Manchester to Inverness and Aberdeen will also become available.
Kam Jandu, chief executive of AGS Airports that operates Southampton, said: "Manchester is the most sought-after route by businesses across the region and was previously used by more than 200,000 passengers per year.
"The re-introduction of this route will further strengthen the economic ties between the two cities."
Mr Farajallah said: "Southampton offers a unique location and we believe the markets, local people and businesses will respond well to our presence in this thriving part of the UK.
"We are also looking forward to welcoming our new team members who will be recruited from the local areas."

Headline: Sombreros souvenir passenger hid £5m cocaine haul
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-03-04T13:48:04.947Z
Text: A man who tried to smuggle cocaine worth more than £5m into Scotland from Mexico told staff he had only brought sombreros back from his trip.
Kristopher Purvis, 35, was stopped by a Border Force officer in the Nothing to Declare channel at Edinburgh Airport on 24 July 2024.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard 45kg (99lb) of cocaine had been concealed in two suitcases carried by Purvis and his travelling companion.
Purvis admitted two charges related to drug smuggling.
The court heard Purvis and his friend each had a suitcase and he was carrying a plastic bag containing four traditional Mexican sombrero souvenir hats.
Advocate depute Brian Gill KC told the High Court in Edinburgh: "The accused told the officer that they had come from Mexico, where they had been since June 30 2024."
The prosecutor told the court Purvis told the officer the "only thing that he had acquired in Mexico was the sombreros".
However, when his suitcase was searched eight vacuum-sealed plastic packages containing cocaine were discovered.
A further seven packages were found in the other suitcase.
The court heard Purvis was cautioned and replied: "It's all mine, my mate had nothing to do with it. I put it in his case."
The 15 packages were each found to contain about 3kg (6.6lb) of 52% pure cocaine.
The court heard the maximum street value of the drugs was about £5,640,000.
Purvis, formerly of Murton, County Durham, was found to have flown from Mexico City airport to Edinburgh via a stopover at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.
He admitted being concerned in the supply of cocaine and the fraudulent evasion of the ban on importing controlled drugs.
Defence solicitor advocate Ewen Roy said that as Purvis was a first offender a background report would be required ahead of sentencing.
The judge, Lord Summers, deferred sentence on Purvis, who followed the proceedings via a TV link to Edinburgh prison, for the preparation of the report.

Headline: Asian hornets eating wide range of insects

Published Date: 2025-03-04T13:45:01.725Z
Text: Invasive Asian hornets are "highly flexible predators" that eat hundreds of different species of insects, including many important pollinators, researchers have warned.
Researchers from the University of Exeter carried out analysis to identify prey in the guts of more than 1,500 hornet larvae from 103 nests in Jersey, France, Spain and the UK.
They raised concerns over the "extra threat" species poses to native insects already under pressure.
The main prey of the Asian hornet is honeybees, with one insect killing up to 50 bees a day, devastating entire colonies.
Researchers identified 1,449 different species which had been fed by adult Asian hornets to their larvae in the nests, more than half of which (55%) could be identified as a specific species.
They found prey included a range of flies, wasps, bees, butterflies, moths and spiders, with honeybees, common wasps and blowflies most commonly found.
Siffreya Pedersen, the study's lead author, said: "Asian hornets were known to prey on honeybees, but until now the full range of their diet had not been tested.
"The diet varied strongly over the seasons and between regions, showing that they are highly flexible predators."
She said insects played "vital roles in enabling ecosystems to function - including pollination, decomposition and pest control".
"Most insect populations are in decline due to factors such as habitat destruction and chemical pollution," she said.
"The expanding area inhabited by Asian hornets poses an extra threat."

Headline: Invasive squirrel will 'have to stay in enclosure'

Text: A non-native invasive grey squirrel on the loose in Guernsey will have to remain in an enclosure once caught, rescuers have said.
The Guernsey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) said last week the squirrel, named Elvis, "accidentally" found its way to the island "via a vehicle".
Paul Allum, who runs Hitchin Squirrel Rescue in the UK, offered to look after Elvis if it is captured but said the animal would have to stay in a large enclosure outside.
He said squirrels were "classed as invasive species [and] it is against the law to release them".
Grey squirrels spread rapidly in the UK after they were introduced in the 19th Century but Guernsey does not have an established population of the species.
Islanders have been told not to gather where the stowaway squirrel has been sighted.
Mr Allum said: "The only concern is not knowing whether it's a female.
"If it's a female, there is a concern that it is baby season now. You never know, she could be pregnant.
"Normally they don't breed 'til after a year old."
Judging from the pictures, Mr Allum said Elvis appears appeared to be healthy and guessed it could be "a last August baby".
"It doesn't look too old," he said.
He said he had been in touch with States of Guernsey veterinary officer David Chamberlain about arrangements for caring for Elvis if it is captured.
Mr Allum said: "Every animal, no matter what, deserves a chance in life."
Details for taking it back to the UK were "in discussion", he added.
"They're not sure which is the best way to tackle it, whether it would be by flying or by boat," he said.

Headline: Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family, and where do they get their money?
Author: Jennifer Clarke, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-04T11:50:13.000Z
Text: A new TV series featuring the Duchess of Sussex - With Love, Meghan - has started on Netflix.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK after stepping back from official royal duties in 2020.
The couple has since launched various commercial ventures, including a new lifestyle brand headed by Meghan Markle called American Riviera Orchard.
Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018. They stepped down as senior royals in January 2020.
Angry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their "SussexRoyal" brand.
Harry remains a prince and is fifth in line to the throne.
The couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH). Harry also gave up his military titles.
When Harry's father Charles became King, the couple's two children became Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex.
Harry and Meghan moved to California in June 2020, saying they wanted space to raise Archie. Lilibet was born there in 2021.
In April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK.
The couple no longer has an official UK residence.
In early 2023, they were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage, a Grade-II listed property on the Windsor estate.
The conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundation has repeatedly raised questions about Harry's US immigration status because of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms.
It wants the government to release his records, to show whether drug use was disclosed - as this can block US visa applications.
But in September 2024, US judge Carl Nichols ruled Prince Harry's visa application should remain private.
At the time, some reports had suggested the prince wanted to return to the UK.
However, BBC News royal correspondent Sean Coughlan said sources had confirmed Prince Harry would continue to be based in the US, partly because of continuing concerns about his family's security arrangements.
In December 2024, the prince said his life in the US was what his mother would have "wanted" for him.
Prince Harry has returned to the UK several times during his various court cases against newspaper publishers.
He made a rare public appearance in London in September 2024 for the WellChild awards, celebrating the bravery of children and young people with serious illness or disability.
But before that, he had not been in the UK since attending a memorial service for his uncle Lord Robert Fellowes in Norfolk in August 2024.
The Prince of Wales was also there, although the brothers reportedly did not speak to each other.
In May 2024, Harry attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the sporting competition for injured servicemen and women which he helped found.
He did not see his father Charles or his brother William during the visit.
In February 2024, he flew back for a 45-minute meeting with Charles after Buckingham Palace announced that the King was being treated for cancer.
Harry attended the King's coronation in May 2023 without Meghan.
The duke and duchess both came back to the UK for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022, and her funeral in September of that year.
As working royals, they received 95% of their annual income from Harry's father, then Prince of Wales. The taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant made up the other 5%.
When they stepped down as senior royals, King Charles gave them "a substantial sum" to help establish their new life.
Harry and Meghan set up the Archewell charitable foundation, and entered into a number of commercial arrangements with private companies.
In February 2024 the couple launched their Sussex.com website, which said they were "shaping the future through business and philanthropy".
American Riviera Orchard
In March 2024, Meghan launched what appeared to be a new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.
Little is known about the new venture, but in April 2024, pictures of branded jam jars circulated on social media, suggesting it may sell food products.
Television
The Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, makes programmes for the Netflix streaming service under a deal thought to be worth millions of dollars.
In April 2024, Archewell said two new series were in production, one celebrating "the joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship", and another exploring the world of professional polo.
Polo was broadcast in December 2024.
With Love, Meghan - which Netflix described as a lifestyle show blending "practical how tos and candid conversation" - began on 4 March.
The couple previously featured in the Harry and Meghan documentary series, where they talked about life in the Royal Family, and The Heart of Invictus series, which discussed the duke's emotional "unravelling" after military service in Afghanistan.
Podcasts
Archewell also made podcasts for Spotify under a contract thought to be worth $25m (£19.7m).
This included a series called Archetypes, which featured the duchess in conversation with other well known women.
The arrangement ended in June 2023.
In February 2024, Meghan announced a new podcast deal with Lemonada Media, with the first programme expected later in 2025.
Books
Harry's memoir, Spare, was published in January 2023.
It discussed his relationship with his brother and father, as well as his grief over the death of his mother, Princess Diana.
The book's publishers promised $1.5m (£1.18m) and £300,000 would be given to the Sentebale and WellChild charities.
Meghan wrote a children's book called The Bench in 2021.
Inheritance
William and Harry received the bulk of Princess Diana's £13m fortune when she died in 1997.
In a 2021 interview, Harry told Oprah Winfrey this money funded his family's move to the US.
He is also thought to have inherited millions from his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother.
It is not known whether Queen Elizabeth left him any money.
Acting
During her acting career, the Duchess of Sussex was reportedly paid $50,000 (£40,000) for each episode of the legal drama Suits.
She appeared in more than 100 episodes.
After stepping back from official duties, the duke and duchess were no longer afforded the security arrangements provided for senior royals.
When Harry first left the UK, he said it would be too dangerous to bring his family back without adequate police protection, and took the government to court.
Home Office lawyers said the duke would still have publicly funded police security in the UK, under "bespoke arrangements".
In late February 2024, the High Court ruled that this approach "was, and is, legally sound".
In June, Harry's legal team said he had been given permission to challenge the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal.
An earlier separate court ruling rejected the prince's request to be allowed to pay privately for more substantial protection.
In January 2025, Prince Harry settled a case with News Group Newspapers (NGN), after it offered a "full and unequivocal apology" for "serious intrusion" into his private life between 1996 and 2011, and "incidents of unlawful activity" by private investigators.
It agreed to pay him an undisclosed amount of damages.
NGN owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times and published the News of the World before its 2011 closure.
Former Labour deputy leader Lord Watson also received an apology, for "unwarranted intrusion" while in government.
He and Prince Harry were the final two claimants after NGN previously settled more than 1,700 cases.
NGN also apologised for serious intrusion into the private life of Prince Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.
Harry also settled a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers in February 2024.
His lawyer said the duke had been awarded "substantial" damages. He was also granted £140,600 in damages in another part of the case.
A separate court case over claims from the duke and others that the Daily Mail-publisher Associated Newspapers unlawfully obtained information about him continues.

Text: The overnight ferry between the Isle of Man and Lancashire has been delayed by more than two hours due to low tides.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the Manxman's berthing in Douglas Harbour had been delayed until 10:00 GMT "due to insufficient water depth".
The schedule for the vessel has faced significant disruption in recent days due to very low spring tides coupled with silting in the harbour.
The flagship ferry's morning journey to Heysham has been delayed until 12:00.
The government-owned ferry firm previously cancelled its usual afternoon and evening services between the two ports due to the tidal conditions.
It follows the temporary grounding of the vessel after its arrival in Douglas on Saturday evening, which the firm said was due to "lower than predicted" water levels caused by high atmospheric pressure.

Headline: The families devastated by the terrible cruelty of serial killer Peter Tobin
Author: David Cowan, Home affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland
Published Date: 2025-03-04T08:17:11.439Z
Text: On the day police found a second body behind a house once occupied by a murderer, the father of a missing teenager raised his hand, crossed his fingers and said he hoped it was his daughter.
Dinah McNicol was 18 when she vanished in 1991, after hitchhiking home to Essex from a dance music festival in Hampshire.
Her father had spoken to countless reporters since then and it just so happened that I was interviewing him when 16 years of tortuous uncertainty were coming to an end.
Ian McNicol had been left in such a dark place that he wanted his daughter to be the person in a shallow grave, because it would mean the family would finally know where she was, get her back, and lay her to rest.
His words laid bare the terrible cruelty of serial killers and they've haunted me ever since.
A new BBC documentary, The Hunt for Peter Tobin, explains how the murder of a young Polish student finally solved the mystery of what had happened to Dinah and a second teenager, 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton, who had gone missing in central Scotland six months earlier in February 1991.
Tobin was a registered sex offender on the run from the authorities when he killed Angelika Kluk and concealed her body beneath the floor of a Glasgow church in September 2006.
He was 60 at the time. The crime was so horrific, detectives were convinced he must have killed before.
Strathclyde Police launched Operation Anagram, a nationwide scoping exercise which tried to establish whether Tobin could be linked to unsolved cases around the UK.
Within months, officers realised he was living in Bathgate when Vicky Hamilton went missing in the West Lothian town.
Despite a huge inquiry and appeals by her distraught family, 15 years had passed with no trace of Vicky ever being found.
The link with Tobin changed everything.
Forensic scientists re-examined evidence from the time of her disappearance and found DNA from Tobin's son on Vicky's purse, which had been left near Edinburgh bus station.
In June 2007, Lothian and Borders Police searched Tobin's former home in Bathgate. In the attic, they discovered a knife which bore traces of Vicky's DNA.
Operation Anagram went on to connect Tobin to Dinah, who'd gone missing at the other end of the country in August 1991.
Her cash card had been used in towns across the south-east of England, from Hove to Margate and Ramsgate in Kent.
The money draining from Dinah's account was compensation she received after her mother Judy died in a road accident when she was six.
The police found evidence linking Tobin to the card and established he was living in Margate when Dinah failed to come home.
One of Tobin's neighbours recalled "Scottish Pete" digging a deep hole in his back garden around that time.
Essex Police thought they were going to get answers for Ian McNicol and his family when they went to Tobin's old house at 50 Irvine Drive in November 2007 - but instead of Dinah, they found Vicky.
Having covered the search in Bathgate, I travelled south to Margate with a sense of disbelief which was shared by the Scottish officers investigating Tobin's past.
Everyone in Scotland knew the face of the smiling schoolgirl with the bobbed dark hair.
The discovery of her remains so far from home was horrifying and baffling. How had she ended up there?
The answer was that Tobin had killed Vicky in Bathgate, dismembered her body, and taken her remains with him when he moved to a new house 470 miles away in the south of England.
In the days that followed, as the police continued their search for Dinah at Irvine Drive, I interviewed her dad at his home in Tillingham, a small Essex village built round a Norman church.
Ian was an instantly likeable man in his late 60s; a retired musician originally from Glasgow who'd named his daughter after a jazz standard.
Over the years, Dinah's disappearance had taken its toll on his health. We sat down and started filming.
"When I lost my wife, we knew she was dead because we had to bury her," he said.
"We went through the normal process of grief.
"When a member of your family goes missing, it's 20 times worse than death because you do not know a thing and all sorts of things go through your imagination."
He was taking some solace from the fact that another family in exactly the same situation had been helped, even though his daughter had not been found.
Ian turned to the camera to address Vicky's family and said: "If you're watching, from me and my family, good luck to you. We wish you all the best."
The doorbell rang. Another reporter told us the police had just announced the discovery of a second body.
Ian agreed to continue the interview, raised his right hand with his fingers crossed and said: "If they've said that, please be Dinah, and get us out of this misery.
"I would bury her next to her mother. So please, let it be Dinah."
Later, after the police confirmed the remains were those of his daughter, Ian said he could die in peace. He passed away in 2014.
In the BBC documentary, Vicky's younger sister Lindsay Brown tells of the impact her disappearance had on their mother Jeanette. Two years after Vicky went missing her mother died, her family said, from a broken heart.
Archive footage shows Lindsay reading a statement to the media outside the High Court in Dundee in 2008, on the day Tobin was convicted of Vicky's murder, flanked by her older sister Sharon and twin brother Lee.
Given all they had been through, what she did that day was as brave as it was difficult to watch.
She said: "Vicky was much more than the girl who was abducted and killed by a stranger or a girl on a missing poster. We will always remember Vicky as she lived, not as she died."
The detectives investigating Tobin's past were certain he had other victims. They did all they could to find answers for other families, to no avail.
Tobin took his secrets to the grave and was serving three life sentences when he died in 2022.
No-one came forward to claim his body. His ashes were disposed of at sea.
When I was interviewed for the BBC documentary, the producer asked what I had thought when I heard the news.
I told him I had been pleased and hoped his death hadn't been pleasant. Should I have been that honest? Did it cross a line? I don't know.
What I do know is that I'll never forget Ian McNicol or what he said to me 17 years ago: "Please be Dinah."

Headline: Five things we learned from Meghan's interview ahead of Netflix series
Author: Sean Coughlan, Royal correspondent
Published Date: 2025-03-04T08:16:24.311Z
Text: The Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle TV series has launched on Netflix on Tuesday morning, but an interview with People magazine in the US has already given an insight into what's on the menu.
Here are some of the things we have learned:
With Love, Meghan is an eight-episode series of cookery, gardening and chats with famous friends.
That doesn't always mean fine dining, as the interview says Chinese take-away food is a favourite in their Californian home.
"But even when I get take-out, I will try to plate it beautifully," says Meghan.
For those already feeling unworthy, she says: "The series is about doing what you can do... and doing it with love."
They go out to eat too. "We go to a lot of dinners, and not just in people's homes or private rooms; we just go into the restaurant... I really love that we can just have fun."
Perhaps more reassuringly, Prince Harry and their five-year-old son Prince Archie are keen on fried eggs, says Meghan, who reveals she's usually up at 6.30am.
"I love making breakfast for my family," she says.
But don't expect to see much of Prince Harry in this series, apparently there's only a glimpse towards the end of the series. As the title suggests, this is about Meghan.
This series seems to be seeing Meghan going back to her pre-royal roots, when she had a lifestyle blog, The Tig.
But Meghan doesn't see herself as an influencer.
"I see myself as an entrepreneur and a female founder... and if the brand ends up influential, then that's great."
We know that she's launching a new lifestyle product range called As Ever, in a partnership with Netflix, so there could be some entrepreneurial overlaps.
"It's almost like a honeymoon period again," says Meghan.
Meghan makes working on the show sound almost like a rekindling of their first romance, for her and Harry.
"I see this spark in his eye when he sees me doing the thing that I was doing when he first met me," she says.
The thing in question was all the work on the blog.
"Scribbling away, writing newsletters, fine-tuning edits and just really being in the details of it.
"I think he loves watching as much as I love doing that creative process. It's just been fun.
"This is who I've always been."
There was a previous podcast, called Archetypes, which faced some tough criticism. The magazine says her new podcast with Lemonada Media is launching this spring.
Meghan has had to face plenty of hostility over the years. And in this interview she talks about responding to constant public scrutiny, including over the development of this latest venture.
"There are tons of twists and turns - even with the name," she says.
"I was figuring it out in real time."
She added: "I appreciate everyone who gave me the grace to make mistakes and figure it out and also to be forgiving with myself through that.
"It's a learning curve."
In terms of their own current media consumption: "We love Shrinking, we just finished Black Doves, and we're excited for the new season of The White Lotus," she said.
While their last Netflix series was raking over their departure from lives as working royals, this latest series is not expected to go into their disputes with the palaces or the Royal Family.
Instead this will be a more upbeat offering, full of expensive kitchens, flowers and sunny views from their new lives in California. It's looking ahead and not back.
But for the people of one faraway corner of southern England, there is a nod to their Sussex titles.
"It's our shared name as a family, and I guess I hadn't recognised how meaningful that would be to me until we had children," she says.
"I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H and I all have together.
"It means a lot to me."

Text: A BBC Scotland journalist has recalled the haunting moment the father of missing Dinah McNicol was told police had found a body in a garden.
Home Affairs correspondent David Cowan was in Ian McNicol's living room in Tillingham, Essex, in November 2007 when a colleague rang the bell to inform him of the grim discovery.
Days earlier the body of Vicky Hamilton – who went missing in Bathgate, West Lothian, in 1991 – was found in the grounds of convicted killer Peter Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent.
When asked about the latest development at the search site Mr McNicol gave a response that has stayed with Cowan.
He told him: "Please be Dinah."
The second body was later confirmed to be the teenager, who was 18 when she vanished in 1991, after hitchhiking home to Essex from a dance music festival in Hampshire.

Headline: The overseas staff serving the South East NHS

Text: Rishan Belete arrived in the UK from her native Sudan in the back of a lorry at the age of 17, as an unaccompanied minor.
That was in 2016. Last year, she qualified as a nurse.
Now working in East Kent, she is one of more than 50,000 NHS staff in the wider South East who self-reported as not being British in 2023, many of whom may have come to the UK as migrants.
Ms Belete said "learning the language and learning the culture was the hardest thing" about integrating in the UK.
Across Kent Sussex and Surrey approximately 25% of NHS staff are from overseas, but the region still struggles with a vacancy rate of more than 8%.
NHS trusts all recruit from overseas to try and fill the gaps they have in their workforce with many describing overseas staff as "vital" to be able to maintain services.
Having left Sudan almost a decade ago, Ms Belete travelled to the UK via Libya and then across the Mediterranean sea.
She said some people could not accept that she had arrived in the UK illegally.
Ms Belete said it was "kind of alarming to people to think that I'm a criminal person".
Supported by the Kent Refugee Action Network, Ms Belete was fostered in Kent as an unaccompanied minor and said she watched Emmerdale and Eastenders on TV to help her learn English.
It was always her dream to work in the health service.
"Healthcare, that was really something I was really passionate about," she said.
After qualifying as a nurse in 2009 Joanne Cabiguen left the Philippines to work for the NHS in 2022.
Ms Cabiguen now works as a theatre practitioner in Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells.
She said at home she was "earning say £75 to £90 per month, which is not very much" and that to come to the UK and work for the NHS was her "dream".
"A friend invited me to try the UK and I was like, why not? It's my dream and it's never too late for dreams right?"
Dr Chirollos Romani qualified as a doctor in Italy.
He is now a cardiologist and Chief Registrar at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust.
Dr Romani has been working in the NHS for seven years - but remembers how challenging his first few weeks were working in the health service.
"The way people communicate in a different country is completely different and you have to get used to it," he said.
A patient asked him if she could spend a penny and he replied: "On what?"
Dr Romani said when there is a patient in front of you, you are "trying to understand what is going on".
"It's like: 'Oh my God, I don't have a grip on this'," he said.
According to Helen Palmer, chief people officer for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, overseas staff are "a pipeline of highly experienced, highly skilled staff".
"It's absolutely key to us to be able to have that talent pipeline to make sure we are filling our vacancy gaps and really providing the best patient care that we possibly can," she added.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "The NHS has always drawn on talent from around the world.
"The service is stronger for it and millions of patients are grateful for the skilled and compassionate care they have received from staff from overseas."
They said the government was also committed to developing homegrown talent and giving opportunities to more people across the country to join the NHS, by training thousands more doctors and nurses.

Headline: How do the Post Office scandal compensation schemes work?
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-03-03T16:14:40.000Z
Text: The Post Office is being removed from one of the schemes set up to compensate victims of the Horizon IT scandal.
The government will now take over responsibility for the Overturned Convictions Scheme, which provides redress for those who have had their convictions quashed
In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.
It is another step in the long-running Post Office scandal. Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.
More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.
We've broken down how they work.
There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.
The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.
Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.
While the cohort secured a £42.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.
The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.
As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme "will receive at least £75,000 in compensation upfront".
The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.
On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.
As of 31 January, £128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.
Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.
If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.
There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.
People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.
A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January. But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.
Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked £600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.
All eligible people are entitled to an "interim" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.
For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.
This will entitle them to an initial £200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept £600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.
As of 31 January, £65m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.
The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out.
A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.
The Post Office scandal goes far beyond the original GLO court case and the people who wound up with criminal convictions.
Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.
In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.
It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.
It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.
It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data from the Department for Business and Trade.
Around £315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025.
The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.
It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.
On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.
As of 31 January 2025, approximately £663m has been paid to over 4,300 claimants across four schemes, according to government data - which includes interim payments for people whose full case has not been settled. That total breaks down as:
The amount an individual sub-postmaster receives can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of their case.
Prof Chris Hodges, chair of the the independent Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, told the BBC compensation payments that have been made so far range from £10,000 to "well over £1m".
The government has not provided an estimate for how much compensation will be paid out in total, but it will inevitably run into the hundreds of millions on top of what has already been paid.

Text: Restrictions on phone use and travel have been imposed on a pilot jailed for helping to smuggle four Albanian migrants into the UK.
Richard Styles, who was arrested at Deenethorpe Airfield in Northamptonshire, has been given a five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order (SCPO).
His British pilot's licence had been confiscated during an earlier prison sentence but Leicester Crown Court heard he had been able to get a US licence.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the order would help them monitor the 55-year-old's activity and prevent him "from engaging in further criminality".
Styles was described as "the go-to pilot for the illegal use of light aircraft" by the judge who jailed him for seven years in April 2023 for facilitating illegal immigration.
Another pilot hired the plane used by Styles to take four Albanian migrants from Belgium to Deenethorpe Airfield near Corby.
Acting on a tip-off, officials from the National Crime Agency arrested him in a hanger at the airfield.
Styles, of no fixed address, has been given a five-year SCPO that includes:
The pilot who hired the plane, Silvano Turchet from West Bridgford in Nottinghamshire, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years.
The taxi driver who picked the migrants up, Vijayakumar Sivakumar, from Tooting in London, was sent to prison for four-and-a-half years.
Alison Abbott from the NCA said: "Offenders involved in organised crime groups so often think they can return to their criminal ventures once they are released from prison.
"But making them subject to Serious Crime Prevention Orders mean we will continue to monitor their activity and prevent them from engaging in further criminality."

Headline: King's pivotal role in Trump and Ukraine balancing act
Author: Sean Coughlan, Royal correspondent
Published Date: 2025-03-03T13:51:55.944Z
Text: Before he came to the throne, the then Prince Charles had been challenged over whether he could avoid meddling and stay out of politics when he became King.
Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy.
He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting.
Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an "unprecedented" sign of friendship and respect.
Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country.
It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US.
It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations.
The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia.
With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky.
Trump described the King as a "beautiful man", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government.
The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral.
For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the "indescribable aggression" against Ukraine, in what he called an "unprovoked attack on their land".
Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values.
He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel.
But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation.
"Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation," said Trudeau ahead of the meeting.
Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians.
They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president.
Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the "special relationship" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada.
The BBC's Royal Watch newsletter has already had plenty of feedback from Canadians who are angry that the King has not spoken up for them against Trump.
"I am a 73-year-old proud Canadian and loyal royal supporter. Should the King choose a relationship with Trump over support of Canada, I will be changing my support to withdrawing from the Commonwealth," emailed Peggy.
"I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all," Ann said in an email to the newsletter.
‌It won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK.
It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion.
And who was she meeting? A popular young Canadian prime minister called Justin Trudeau. It was seen as a sign of Western solidarity to support Ukraine.
Would anyone have believed three years later that he'd be seeking support against the United States?

Headline: Tidal conditions lead to Manx ferry disruption

Text: Changes have been made to the Isle of Man's ferry schedule after the Manxman became temporarily grounded in Douglas Harbour on Saturday evening.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said high atmospheric pressure meant the tides were lower than expected, and the vessel became stuck while manoeuvring.
Following checks of the vessel by divers, it resumed its services on Saturday with a two-hour delay to its evening sailing to Heysham.
However, changes have been made to the timings of the vessel's evening and overnight sailings and cancelled two crossings on Tuesday.
Under the amended schedule, the Manxman will sail to the Lancashire Port at 10:00 GMT but will not make its return journey until 01:30 on Wednesday.
Infrastructure Minister Michelle Haywood said sediment had been washed into Douglas Harbour by the river, which "tends to deposit" in an area where the ferry turn, which had led it to be "sucked into the mud".
She said a large dredging programme to "clear away the silt" was needed and would be investigated, but in the meantime the Steam Packet would continue to amend its sailings to avoid a similar situation during the "particularly high spring tides".
The ferry firm confirmed the Manxman had become "stuck on mud for a short time and was not able to continue its berthing operation until the tide came up sufficiently".
It said there had been "no danger to passengers, crew or the vessel, and throughout the delay those onboard were kept informed of the situation by the master".
Managing Director Brian Thompson said the operator would conduct a review of what happened and it would work with all parties including the infrastructure department's harbours division to "ensure we don't see a repeat".

Headline: Deal to buy Prince Andrew's business unravels
Author: Sean Coughlan, Royal correspondent, Ben King, Business reporter

Text: A deal to take over the Duke of York's former start-up business network now seems to be in doubt, sources close to the negotiations have told the BBC.
Dutch company Startupbootcamp (SBC) had held talks about buying Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace network, a sale that could have provided him with a multi-million pound financial lifeline.
But sources close to SBC say despite an announcement of an intended takeover, and talk of possible funding from Bahrain, nothing has been signed and no transactions have been carried out.
It comes as Prince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion after he was cut off financially by King Charles.
The prince has to find several million pounds per year to cover security costs and pay for the upkeep of the 19th Century, 30-room house, in Windsor.
A lucrative source of income had appeared to be on the horizon, with SBC widely reported in the UK press to be in the process of buying the contacts and network of the Pitch@Palace project.
In February SBC announced its plans: "International investment group set to take over former Pitch@Palace global network."
Pitch@Palace had been a Dragons' Den-style pitching competition for new business ideas, set up Prince Andrew in 2014 and run by him before he stepped down from royal duties in 2019.
SBC had said it was attracted by Pitch@Palace's legacy of contacts, with 80,000 applications from 3,000 entrepreneurial companies in more than 60 countries.
The Dutch firm, which has been running since 2010, helps to mentor and grow start-up businesses, particularly in the technology sector, with investments in 1,700 early-stage companies and running schemes in 27 countries.
A takeover of the Pitch@Palace network had seemed imminent with SBC saying the partnership would be a "fantastic opportunity" and that it wanted to make use of a "great, but dormant" network of entrepreneurs. Jointly branded events had already been held.
But sources close to SBC now say that despite a meeting at Buckingham Palace and a positive sounding press release about seeing "immense value in the network", nothing was concluded.
No deal with Prince Andrew was ever signed or closed, and no transactions were made, whether in Europe, the Middle East or China, according to SBC's side of negotiations. Prince Andrew has been approached for comment.
The plans to take over the Pitch@Palace network had initially been presented as a project between SBC and its "strategic partner", an investment company in Bahrain, called Waterberg Stirling.
That arrangement seems no longer in place, with sources close to SBC saying it now wanted to "sever ties" with the investment firm.
Waterberg Stirling had been registered in Bahrain in late 2024 by Dominic Hampshire, an adviser to Prince Andrew. The prince has had longstanding business connections with Bahrain.
There are also strong links between the UK and Bahraini royal families, with King Hamad of Bahrain visiting King Charles in Windsor in November 2024.
Mr Hampshire is the only named director of Waterberg Stirling on registration documents, but another person linked to the firm has been Adnan Sawadi.
In July 2024, the entrepreneur Mr Sawadi gave a presentation in China showing the intended partnership between SBC and the successor to Pitch@Palace, Innovate Global, which he hoped would provide a bridge connecting Middle Eastern funding with projects in China.
His speech singled out for praise Yang Tengbo - the man who later that year would be accused of being a Chinese spy, seeking influence over Prince Andrew, claims that Mr Yang has continued to reject as untrue.

Headline: Airline retains patient transfer service contract
Author: Ashlea Tracey, BBC News, Isle of Man
Published Date: 2025-02-28T17:36:31.795Z
Text: Loganair will continue provide the Isle of Man's patient transfer services for non-urgent hospital appointments in the UK for next three years, Manx Care has confirmed.
The regional airline already has the current contract for the service, which sees the Manx government arrange air transport to Liverpool for those receiving treatment in the UK.
The health care body's chief executive Teresa Cope said the air links offered "vital connectivity" for residents who need treatment that cannot be given on island.
Loganair chief executive Luke Farajallah said those travelling for health reasons "expect the very best care from their airline and the team was "determined" to deliver it.
The operator took over the service following the collapse of Flybe in 2020, with about 15,000 patient transfer journeys taken each year.
The government has contracts with several hospitals, predominantly in the North West of England, which deliver specialist treatment not available on the island, such as transplants, burn care and specialised cancer treatment.
The contract, which was awarded after a tender process, involves a minimum daily return service from Monday to Friday, providing flights mainly to and from Liverpool John Lennon Airport.
Ms Cope said the flights were important "lifeline flights" for the Manx community allowing "access vital UK services for specialist medical appointments that cannot be delivered locally on-island".
Mr Farajallah said the airline was "deeply committed to the Isle of Man, its people, and their wellbeing".
It aimed to ensure that "reliable and dependable flight options" were "always available to those who need it most", he added.

Headline: Londoners asked again for views on Oxford Street
Author: Jess Warren, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-28T06:00:23.694Z
Text: Londoners are being asked for their views on the potential pedestrianisation of Oxford Street.
Sir Sadiq Khan hopes that altering the famous shopping street will increase visitor numbers, create jobs, and boost growth for London.
The consultation is the mayor's latest attempt to change the street; his attempt in 2018 was blocked by the then Conservative-run local authority.
Last year following the general election, the Labour government gave the mayor planning powers to create a Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) around Oxford Street, allowing him to take control of the area away from Westminster City Council.
The exact boundaries of the proposed area have not yet been announced as the MDC's formation is part of the consultation.
Sir Sadiq said: "Oxford Street has been known as the nation's high street but the area has suffered in recent years.
"My proposals are designed to unlock the true potential of Oxford Street and deliver a world-class, accessible, clean, avenue.
"These proposals would help to restore this famous part of the capital and support good businesses, while creating new jobs and boosting growth."
Karim Fatehi, CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, urged businesses to participate in the consultation.
Adam Hug, leader of Westminster Council, said: "Subject to the outcome of the mayor's consultation, our role is to ensure that the mayor's proposed Oxford Street transformation delivers for local communities, as well as for London.
"We have already fought hard to secure numerous improvements from the mayor of London to ensure that any plans for Oxford Street are deliverable and meet the needs of local residents, businesses, and wider London."
Dee Corsi, chief executive at New West End Company, a partnership of businesses and property owners in the West End, said: "We have long championed the regeneration of Oxford Street, recognising its vital importance to London and the UK economy.
"The launch of the public consultation marks a significant milestone in the journey of the nation's high street."
But one London cabbie told BBC London pedestrianisation would be a "nightmare for drivers".
"Being a cab driver 26 years this year, Khan is just shutting down London," she said.
"He's not thinking about disabled people or anybody that just wants to get in a cab to get home. From a cab driver's point of view, it's very negative.
"From a pedestrian's point of view, it's a win, because it's safe."
An Oxford Street shopper said pedestrianisation "would make it so much easier for shopping", while another said it would be a "bonus" if it stopped cyclists from using the road.
Londoners can have their say on proposals until 2 May.

Headline: Who is Andrew Tate? The self-proclaimed misogynist influencer
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-02-27T18:28:03.000Z
Text: The controversial British-American influencer Andrew Tate has left Romania, where he was charged with rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women.
He and his brother are believed to be on a private jet heading to the US, sources told the BBC.
Tate was put under house arrest in Romania in August 2024 when prosecutors launched a second criminal investigation against himself and his brother Tristan, as well as four other suspects. They all deny wrongdoing.
Separately, the brothers are wanted in the UK to face allegations of sexual assault which they also deny.
The brothers have also been accused of tax evasion in the UK. A British court ruled in December 2024 that police could seize more than £2m ($2.4m) from them for failing to pay tax on £21m in revenue from their online businesses.
Andrew Tate said the ruling was "not justice" and called it a "co-ordinated attack".
Warning: Contains references to sexual violence.
Self-proclaimed "misogynist" Andrew Tate first rose to fame after an appearance on the British version of reality TV show Big Brother in 2016. He only lasted six days on the programme, before being removed following the emergence of a video that appeared to show him attacking a woman.
He said at the time that the footage had been edited and was "a total lie trying to make me look bad".
Now, the 38-year-old former kickboxer boasts more than 10 million followers on X, formerly Twitter - and a worldwide profile.
Tate - full name Emory Andrew Tate - was born in December 1986.
He is named after his father, an American who worked for the US Air Force in Britain, and who was also a chess master. His mother and father met in the UK before moving to America where Tate was raised until his parents divorced.
Following the divorce, Tate moved to Luton, England, with his mother.
Both Tate and his younger brother Tristan said they experienced poverty in England. In interviews, they recalled going to KFC to save other people's leftover chicken and freezing it for future meals.
Tate was a kickboxing world champion four times - but it was online where he found worldwide fame.
Tate has appeared in countless videos, flaunting an ultra-luxurious lifestyle of fast cars, private jets, and yachts.
Shortly before he was first arrested in December 2022, he engaged in a row with environmental activist Greta Thunberg on Twitter.
He claimed to have 33 cars and said he would send her a list of their "respective enormous emissions".
On TikTok, videos with the #AndrewTate hashtag have been viewed billions of times. That figure also includes videos made by people criticising the influencer.
In an interview with another YouTuber, he said he was "absolutely a misogynist", and added: "I'm a realist and when you're a realist, you're sexist. There's no way you can be rooted in reality and not be sexist."
In that same video, he described women as "intrinsically lazy" and said there was "no such thing as an independent female".
Andrew Tate has been singled out for the effect he has had in spreading misogyny online among boys and young men by authorities in the UK.
Speaking at the launch of a report into violence against women and girls in July 2024, Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth said: "We know that some of this is also linked to radicalisation of young people online, we know the influencers, Andrew Tate, the element of influencing of particularly boys, is quite terrifying."
The report stated that police were now working with counter-terrorism teams to combat the risks of young men being radicalised.
Numerous social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, have banned him - with the latter saying that "misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated".
Tate was banned from Twitter for saying women should "bear responsibility" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated on the platform, now known as X.
In the past, Tate has used extreme language relating to acts of violence against women. In a text seen by BBC Panorama, he wrote to one woman: "I love raping you".
In a combative interview with the BBC in June 2023, when pushed on whether his controversial views on women harmed young people, the influencer claimed he was a "force for good" and that he was "acting under the instruction of God to do good things".
Andrew Tate and his brother face a number of civic and criminal legal cases.
Tate was detained alongside his brother Tristan in December 2022 in a suburb of the Romanian capital, Bucharest, as part of an investigation into allegations of human trafficking and rape, which they deny. The pair were charged along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.
In response to the charges against them, the media team for the Tate brothers said: "While this news is undoubtedly predictable, we embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence and vindicate their reputation."
In December 2023, the Tate brothers were ordered not to leave Romania after they made a request to visit their mother in hospital in the UK.
A Romanian court ruled in early July 2024 that Tate and his brother could leave the country but had to stay within the European Union. This decision was opposed by prosecutors, and overturned less than two weeks later by the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
In March 2024, British police investigating Andrew Tate on allegations of rape and human trafficking were granted a warrant to extradite him and his brother to the UK.
Separately, in May 2024, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Tate and his brother said they were bringing a civil case against him at the High Court in the UK for "damages for injuries they suffered as a result".
A representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they "unequivocally deny all allegations".
Another legal issue facing the pair in the UK is a civil case brought in July 2024 by Devon and Cornwall Police, in which they are accused of failing to pay any tax on £21m of revenue from their online businesses, including online "wealth creation" platform Hustlers' University.
A third person known only as J is also accused as part of the case, with the force seeking to recover about £2.8 million held in seven frozen bank accounts, an application which the defendants are contesting.
Tate has described himself as a "self-made multi-millionaire" and said he earned money through "a little webcam business from my apartment".
"I had 75 women working for me in four locations and I was doing $600,000 a month from webcam," he said in a podcast interview.
In a now-deleted page on his website, he said he brought women into the "adult entertainment industry".
"My job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, test if she's quality, get her to fall in love with me to where she'd do anything I say and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together," he wrote on the page - which was subsequently taken down in February 2022.
Tate works alongside his brother, Tristan, who told the Daily Mirror that their business was "all a big scam" which saw men pay to talk to women online.
"I've seen men sell cars, TVs... This guy's gran passed away and they were waiting for the sale of the house. When the house was sold he'd get £20,000 and promised it to [a model], to pay for her fake financial problem," Tristan told the Mirror.

Headline: 'Pilot confusion' led to serious airport incident

Text: An investigation into a serious incident involving a plane attempting to land in fog found "confusion and miscommunication" between the crew.
A Jump Air flight from Southampton was on the approach to Guernsey Airport in August when it descended below the minimum height allowed during poor visibility.
The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found there was confusion between the pilot and co-pilot which resulted in delays to the plane making a climb.
It then diverted and landed safely back at Southampton Airport.
The AAIB said the operator had taken a number of safety actions since the incident.
Guernsey airline Aurigny said the flight was being operated by Jump Air - an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) or "wet lease" provider.
A spokesman said this was commonplace and typically used by airlines to increase capacity during peak periods or when its fleet capacity is impacted.
It added: "We are encouraged by the report findings that Jump Air has implemented a number of changes since the incident.
"We are very glad all those involved are safe and the safety and welfare of our customers and crew is always our priority. We will work closely with regulatory bodies and ACMI operators accordingly."

Headline: Manx ferry chartered to Channel Islands for a year
Author: Ashlea Tracey, BBC News, Isle of Man
Published Date: 2025-02-27T16:32:30.427Z
Text: Manx back-up freight vessel MV Arrow will operate a year-long charter in the Channel Islands, the government-owned ferry firm has confirmed.
Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the agreement would come into force on 24 March, after the return of the Ben-my-Chree from dry dock.
The Steam Packet said the vessel would undergo port trials and pilotage training before entering service.
Danish ferry operator DFDS confirmed the MV Arrow would act as the firm's main freight vessel for the Jersey to Portsmouth route from 28 March.
Currently based in Douglas, the MV Arrow can carry 66 14m (46ft) trailers and accommodate 12 passengers.
It was bought by the Steam Packet for about £8m in 2022 as a back-up freight vessel for the island's then flagship ferry, the Ben-my-Chree.
While it has remained an option for the firm since the arrival of the Manxman in July 2023, under the company's sea services agreement with the Manx government the former flagship ferry must be retained for back-up passenger and freight services.
Jersey's government signed a contract with DFDS to operate ferry services in the Channel Islands in December.
On March 28 the Danish firm is set to take over the contract from previous provider Condor Ferries, which had also used the MV Arrow to increase freight capacity.
It will travel to Teeside for its own dry-docking before its charter with DFDS following the return of the Ben-my-Chree to Manx waters next month.
Steam Packet managing director Brian Thomson said the year-long charter would take place while the firm "future fleet strategy" was agreed, he said.
A committee of Manx politicians recently recommended a new sea services framework should be developed for the Isle of Man by the end of 2025.
A spokesman for DFDS said the MV Arrow would be the main freight vessel for the Portsmouth route, alongside its RoPax vessel Stena Vinga, which would provide freight and passenger capacity.
The Danish firm said it was making a "considerable investment" into its fleet to provide "modern and comfortable accommodation" through a refurbishment of the fast ferry Levante Jet, which would service the Jersey to Poole route from April.

Headline: Son loses case against parents over move to Africa
Author: Sanchia Berg and Levi Jouavel, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-27T15:35:00.536Z
Text: A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.
The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.
He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school "there would have been no way I would have agreed to it".
But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being "groomed" into criminal activity.
In a written statement to the court, he said: "I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible."
In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that "this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion."
He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was "driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love".
The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.
He said that the boy's parents believe "and in my judgement with reason" that their son has "at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives".
The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be "yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London."
The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was "mocked" and "never settled in" at the school in Ghana.
He said he "could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights".
The boy wrote that he was "so scared and desperate" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.
"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home," he wrote.
He said he had been "mistreated" at the school, adding: "I'm begging to go back to my old school."
However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.
In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was "not a punishment but a measure to protect him".
She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was "every parent's worst nightmare", she said.
She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's "destruction".
Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.
That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.
She said it was not only the parents who were worried.
His school claimed it had "suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.
The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor "involved in gangs in any way". He said he "does not know anyone involved in a gang" and he does not carry a knife.
He acknowledged in his statements that "my behaviour wasn't the best" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.
The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.
In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: "This has been a really difficult time for us all."
They added: "Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family."
James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a "real shock" to the teenager.
"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully."
The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.
The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.
He wrote: "I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than."
The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.
He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.
The father said they were both very impressed.
However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.
The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.
"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection," Mr Netto said.
He said he had seen cases where "in their parents' eyes" young people were "falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours".
Following the judgment, he added: "We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man."

Headline: How many people cross the Channel in small boats and how many claim asylum?

Text: The government has announced a series of measures to tackle people smuggling, including a new criminal offence of endangering the lives of others at sea.
Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024.
The number of people claiming asylum in the UK during the year to December 2024 was the highest since records began, in 1979.
As at 26 February 2,056 people had crossed the Channel since the start of 2025.
In 2024 as a whole, 36,816 were detected making the crossing.
The highest figures were for 2022, when 45,755 people arrived.
Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats.
Of those who arrived in 2024, more than 23,000 did so after Labour won the July 2024 general election.
The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists.
Suspects face travel bans, social-media blackouts and phone restrictions.
A new offence of endangering lives at sea will carry a jail term of up to five years.
And those convicted of acts in preparation for smuggling - such as buying boat parts - will face up to 14 years in prison.
Separately, the government has issued guidance saying anyone entering the UK by an irregular route - such as a small boat crossing - will normally be refused citizenship.
Previously, refugees who entered this way could apply for citizenship after 10 years.
The Refugee Council estimates at least 71,000 people will be affected.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency, tracks the number of people who die attempting to cross the Channel.
The IOM estimates that at least 78 migrants died in 2024, making it the deadliest year on record. It says that at least 225 migrants have lost their lives attempting to cross since 2018.
Its figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or as a result of medical issues.
The Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, with more people crammed into less seaworthy boats.
According to the latest Home Office figures, Afghans were the top nationality arriving by small boat in 2024.
Syrians made up the second largest group, followed by people from Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea.
These five nationalities accounted for 61% of all small-boat arrivals.
Albanians were the top nationality detected arriving by small boat in 2022, with 12,658 arrivals, but only 616 people came from the country in 2024.
More than 108,130 people claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending December 2024, the Home Office figures show, the highest number since records began, in 1979, an increase of 18% compared with 2023, and almost twice the number in 2021.
The previous peak, of 103,000 was recorded in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq.
Claims fell sharply after 2002, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010.
But numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria, and have risen again recently, after an increase in recorded small-boat arrivals.
And in 2024, almost one out of every three (32%) of those claiming asylum arrived via this route.
In the year to December 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 10,500 applications.
A quarter of all applications came from people from Pakistan, Afghanistan (8,508) and Iran (8,099),
Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures.
As at 17 December 2024, 267,200 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government.
There are also separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens.
The Home Office figures show 91% of the 7,800 refugees resettled in the UK in 2024 arrived through the Afghan Resettlement Programme.
Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered.
At the end of December 2024, 90,686 cases relating to 124,802 people were awaiting an initial decision.
That is 5% fewer than were waiting at the end of 2023 - but the the number of outstanding cases is still higher than before 2022.
Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023.
But 4,500 "complex cases" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December that year and 1,428 remained unresolved at the end of December 2024.
The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter.
In the year to the end of December 2024,8,200 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country, an increase of 28% from 2023.
Albanians were the most common nationality for enforced returns in 2024 - 84%, compared with 87% of all returns in 2023.
Between 2018 and December 2024, 4,995 people who came to the UK in small boats were returned - about 3% of the total small-boat arrivals during the period.
There were more than 180,000 arrivals by sea in Europe during 2024, with Italy receiving more than a third. Greece and Spain also received large numbers.
In 2023, there were 263,000 arrivals by sea in Europe.
In the year ending September 2024, 1.11 million people claimed asylum in the European Union and European Economic Area, down 3% compared with the previous year.
Germany received the most applicants, 294,415 - more than a quarter of the total.
France was second (162,390) followed by Italy (162,305), Spain (161,470) and the UK (99,790).

Text: The number of people claiming asylum in the UK in 2024 has reached its highest level since records began in 1979, Home Office figures show.
According to data published on Thursday, 108,138 people claimed asylum in the year to December 2024 - an increase of 18% on 2023 and almost twice the number in 2021.
The Home Office said the previous recorded peak was in 2002.
The new high follows an uptick in recorded small boat arrivals in recent years. The number of small boat arrivals also increased in 2024 - 25% higher than in 2023 - but the figure was 20% lower than in 2022.
The UK now receives the fifth largest number of asylum seekers in the "EU plus" area at a time when the government is under pressure to cut the asylum decision backlog.
These figures, which cover the end of the Conservative government and the start of Labour, show the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision fell by 5% last year - with more than 90,600 cases, relating to around 124,800 people, pending a decision as of the end of 2024.
The number remains higher than before 2022.
The UK also sent more people into immigration detention last year, with that figure increasing by 12%.
Meanwhile, the UK returned 2,251 people to another country who had arrived by small boat last year, a 10% increase compared to 2023.
There has also been a sharp increase in people granted citizenship - with the figure standing at more than 269,600 in 2024.
The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said there were "no quick fixes" to the "global" problem of illegal migration, but the government had a "serious long-term plan to restore order to the asylum system".
Border Security and Asylum minister Angela Eagle criticised the previous government for a "broken asylum system", saying Labour inherited a "huge backlog" of claims.
"We are beginning to get some order to the system but it will take time to make certain that we can get a grip and start making the system work again."
Asked why claims are so high, Eagle said "many people want to come here", further referring to those coming on work and student visas and then claiming asylum.
She underlined "we have to be much tougher" dealing with visa overstayers.
Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as "no surprise," saying there was "no deterrent".
Philp added that the blame for the numbers "lies firmly at Labour's feet, who have been slow to act to tackle the crisis unfolding on our border".
The British Red Cross's policy, research and advocacy director Mubeen Bhutta called for the government to create "more safe routes" to prevent people taking dangerous journeys to the UK.
"Behind today's numbers are real men, women and children who have been forced to flee their homes. Too many are making perilous journeys to find safety, because they have no other option," Bhutta said in a statement.
"For the vast majority of people, there is no way to claim asylum in the UK without already being here."
New guidance issued for visa and immigration staff earlier this month set out that anyone entering the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey to do so, including those already here, will normally be refused citizenship.
The measure was criticised by the Refugee Council as well as some Labour MPs.
The Refugee Council said on Thursday it was "encouraged" the government continued to work on the "broken asylum system" during its first six months in power.
However, it called for further efforts to cut the backlog of asylum applications to avoid people "stuck in hotels, trapped in limbo and unable to work".
The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023.
The government has pledged to stop this practice by the end of the parliament.
The government is legally obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who cannot afford to support themselves while their claims are being considered. But the number of people seeking asylum in the UK has hit record levels, leading to a shortage of spaces in existing accommodation.
While irregular arrivals rose last year, the number of work and study visas - which account for a majority of arrivals, not including visitors and transit, examined by the Home Office - dropped.
The previous Conservative government introduced measures to reduce legal migration with changes to visa processes – including an increase to the minimum salary for a UK skilled worker visa.
The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK.
The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000.
This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000).
Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route.
The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas.
But Rishi Sunak's government tightened the rules late in 2023, leading to falls in people coming on this visa throughout last year.
In September 2024, the current Labour government announced further measures including stronger rules around visa sponsorship of migrant workers.
A White Paper is due to be published this year setting out a plan to reduce legal migration.
Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, referred to a "boom and bust" in some visa categories over recent years.
"The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high," he said.
"Despite the declines, overall visa grants to non-EU citizens remain well above pre-Brexit levels."

Text: Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (IOMSPC) has secured a long-term charter for one of its freight vessels which will sail predominantly between Jersey and Portsmouth.
The vessel, Arrow, will operate for 12 months with DFDS, the firm that operates Jersey's ferry services between the island, UK and France.
DFDS and Jersey's government signed a contract in December with the contract set to start from 28 March.
IOMSPC managing director Brian Thomson said: "We're pleased to have secured a long term charter for Arrow with a renowned international operator such as DFDS."
He added: "This gives us security while the future fleet strategy is agreed with our stakeholders."
Arrow was purchased by IOMSPC in September 2022 as a back-up freight vessel to the Ben-my-Chree, the company's main vessel at the time, for about £8 million.
But in 2023, the company purchased a £78m vessel known as Manxman, IOMSPC's first new passenger and freight ferry since 1998.
It signalled the end for the Ben-my-Chree as the island's main ferry which had now been retained for back-up passenger and freight services.

Text: Hospices in Devon and Cornwall will share more than £1m for upgrades and refurbishments as part of funding released this week, the government has announced.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) announced £100m of funding in December as part of its Plan for Change - an initiative to improve social care across England - with £25m being released nationwide this week.
Seven hospice operators across the region will share £1.07m of funding.
Minister for Care Stephen Kinnock said it was the "largest investment in a generation" and would help "transform hospice facilities across England".
Paul Brinsley, CEO of Cornwall Hospice Care, said the £161,000 it is set to receive would help it improve sustainability and reduce overheads by installing insulation and improving double glazing, while it was exploring options for how to invest the next batch of money.
Mr Brinsley said it was "exciting" to get money to invest in one-off capital projects, but added it was a "struggle" getting longer-term funding.
The remainder of the funding - which will be used to "modernise facilities, improve IT systems and ensure patients receive the highest quality care" - would be released in April, DHSC said.

Text: A hospital in Dorset providing a specialised psychiatric service does meet the needs of patients in Jersey, the States has said.
The Minister for Health and Social Services has designated St Ann's Hospital in Dorset as an "approved establishment" for islanders to receive the specialised service which cannot be provided locally.
The approval means patients initially transferred to the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) can be transferred to other wards if clinically appropriate.
The service will be subject to monitoring by the Jersey adult mental health services, the States said.
It said: "The minister has responsibility to approve establishments or premises for the purpose of care and treatment of patients.
"Governance checks have confirmed that the service is appropriate and adequate to meet the needs of service users who require this service, which cannot be provided locally in Jersey due to the specialised nature of the service and the PICU environment."
The decision also affects patients transferred to UK hospitals through the criminal justice system, as any hospital must be designated "an approved establishment" under Jersey's mental health law.
The most recent Care Quality Commission report rated the trust's acute wards for adults of working age and psychiatric intensive care units as good.

Headline: Ten Church of England clergy face disciplinary action
Author: Aleem Maqbool, Religion editor, Steve Swann, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-25T18:59:41.536Z
Text: The Church of England says it is initiating disciplinary proceedings against 10 members of clergy following a review of evidence in the report into the prolific abuser, John Smyth.
Among those facing action are former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and Rev Andrew Cornes - who was due to be on the committee picking the next Archbishop of Canterbury.
Smyth, who died in 2018, used horrific violence to attack boys at his Winchester home in the 1970s and 1980s, the Makin Review into his abuse found.
Justin Welby, who stepped down as Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this year because of the scandal, is among several senior figures not facing action because of "insufficient evidence" for disciplinary proceedings.
Also not facing action but coming under criticism in the Makin Review are four serving bishops - the current Bishop of Lincoln Stephen Conway, Bishop of Episcopal Ministry in the Anglican Communion Jo Bailey Wells, Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Martin Seeley and the Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba.
A survivor of Smyth's abuse told the BBC he was relieved that some were "at long last" being held to account for their failings but said he was surprised others had not been named.
The long-awaited report was released in November and detailed "the prolific, brutal and horrific" abuse perpetrated against more than 120 boys and young men by Smyth at Christian camps from the late 1970s in England until his death in South Africa in 2018.
That review led to the resignation of Justin Welby for what he acknowledged was his "personal and institutional responsibility".
The Church's National Safeguarding Team has since reviewed the evidence against nearly 40 other active clergy criticised in the report, deciding that some of it meets the threshold for further action.
Those who are facing disciplinary proceedings by the Church of England are accused in the report of various degrees of failing to act during the timeline of Smyth's abuse.
The report said former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey had been informed of the abuse in an outline of a report in 1983 which "contained enough information about abuses to signal a need for action regarding John Smyth".
Lord Carey denied seeing it and told the review he did not know Smyth when he studied at Trinity Theological College when Lord Carey was principal. Makin said that "seems highly unlikely" given Smyth's public prominence at the time.
He gave up his "permission to officiate" in December following a BBC investigation into the Church of England's handling of a separate sexual abuse case.
Another priest that now faces disciplinary action is Canon Andrew Cornes, a retired clergyman from the Chichester diocese who was due to be a member of the Crown Nominations Commission that will appoint the next Archbishop of Canterbury.
The Makin review said Rev Cornes was told in 1982 by a victim of Smyth about abuse he suffered. It said there was "no evidence to suggest that Andrew Cornes took action to respond to this, he suggests that he thought that the matter was being dealt with".
The Church of England has clarified that Rev Cornes has "voluntary stepped back from ministry pending the outcome of this process and will not be participating in the Crown Nominations Commission".
The full list of clergy to face disciplinary action includes:
Because of the length of time after their alleged failures to act took place, the initiation of the disciplinary process for each needs to be approved by the Church's President of Tribunals.
Given the vulnerability of the victims involved, it is understood they are likely to proceed.
The so-called clergy disciplinary measure process could lead to anyone found guilty being prohibited from exercising church ministry for life.
Mark Stibbe was groomed and brutally beaten by Smyth after joining his school's Christian Forum in 1977 and has waited decades for justice.
Mr Stibbe said he was "relieved" those identified in the review would be "held to account for their failings".
"I, along with my fellow Smyth survivors, wait with keen interest to see whether any disciplinary measures are enforced," he said.
"I am surprised that those senior clergy who in 2013 knew the full extent of Smyth's abuses, and who did not properly ensure that Smyth was brought to justice, are not named in the list released today," he added.
"Nevertheless, it's good to know that after all these years not only the truth is being discovered but that justice is being done".
Alexander Kubeyinje, the Church of England's national director of safeguarding, said survivors and victims had endured lifelong effects from Smyth's "appalling abuse".
"We have announced next steps in the process looking at both risk and disciplinary processes," he added.
Smyth had also worked as a barrister representing morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse whilst he ran the camps for young evangelical Christians.
Reports of his physical abuse of boys were first revealed in an investigation by Channel 4 News, in February 2017.
Smyth and his wife Anne were excommunicated by his local church in Cape Town, South Africa, the year before he died.

Headline: American loses UK appeal to become legally non-binary
Author: Josh Parry, LGBT & Identity Reporter
Published Date: 2025-02-25T18:45:36.148Z
Text: An American who wanted to be formally recognised as non-binary in the UK has been told by the Court of Appeal their gender identity does not legally exist in this country.
Ryan Castellucci previously lost a High Court challenge to have their gender recorded as non-binary on a gender recognition certificate - a document which changes someone's legal sex - after moving to the UK in 2019.
They had obtained legal recognition as non-binary in California in 2021, and were issued an American passport in 2022 listing their sex as 'X'.
Dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Singh said the issue was "potentially controversial" and was "better suited to resolution in Parliament than the courts".
At an earlier hearing, the court heard how Castellucci, a cyber security expert who moved to the UK from California, uses the title "Mx" and refers to themselves using they/them pronouns.
While they have undergone surgery and hormone treatment, they told the court they continue to use the name Ryan as it is considered unisex in the US.
Castellucci described the experience of trying to obtain legal documents listing them as non-binary as an "ordeal" and the court heard they worried about possible difficulties related to their gender identity when applying for British citizenship.
They also raised concerns about how their gender identity would be reflected on their death certificate, when their US documents state they are non-binary.
Lord Justice Singh, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Sir Andrew McFarlane, said that only 11 countries worldwide, as well as some US states including California, recognise non-binary gender in law.
Non-binary is an umbrella term for those those who do not identify as exclusively male or female.
In a judgment published on Tuesday, Lord Justice Singh said: "The concept of 'gender' in the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), when referred to in the context of the domestic law route, is confined to two genders."
He added that, at an earlier appeal in 2023, the government said "no changes were currently needed and more research and consultation would be needed before any changes were contemplated".
He continued: "There is no general consensus, either in the Council of Europe or more generally around the world, in favour of recognising non-binary status.
"Furthermore, this is an area of social policy which is highly sensitive and potentially controversial, thereby being better suited to resolution in Parliament rather than in the courts.
"This is not only for reasons of democratic legitimacy but also for reasons of institutional competence."
Anna Dews, associate solicitor at Leigh Day, the firm which represented Castellucci, said they were considering appealing the ruling.
She said: "Ryan's only registered gender is non-binary. Despite Parliament legislating for the UK to recognise foreign-acquired genders, the courts have so far ruled that non-binary foreign genders do not count.
"Ryan considers that there cannot be true gender equality without recognition of the fact that not all genders are binary."

Headline: Funds in place for Borders Railway extension study
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-02-25T12:33:33.560Z
Text: A funding package has been confirmed to allow a feasibility study into extending the Borders Railway to go ahead.
The UK Department for Transport has committed up to £5m towards the project with that sum matched by the Scottish government.
The funding had previously been agreed through the Borderlands Growth Deal but the new UK Labour government wanted to carry out a spending review before releasing its share.
It paves the way to appoint a project manager to assess the "benefits and challenges" of extending the line beyond Tweedbank and on to Carlisle.
The news comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the opening of the line between Edinburgh and the Borders later this year.
Both the Scottish and UK governments agreed in 2021 to provide £10m towards exploring the feasibility of progressing the line from Tweedbank to Carlisle.
However, it has taken four years for the funding package to be finally unlocked.
UK government Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill said: "It's great news that the UK Department for Transport has now confirmed up to £5m towards feasibility work to explore the potential to extend the Borders Railway from Tweedbank to Carlisle.
"We look forward to working with deal partners as the feasibility work progresses."
Scotland's Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government remained committed to providing £5m towards taking the project forward.
"We welcome the news that the UK government will now match our commitment of up to £5m for a feasibility study to extend the Borders Railway and are supportive of partners securing a project manager with the technical expertise to deliver the project well," she said.
Rail Minister Lord Hendy added: "I'm pleased to commit to the progression of the Borders Railway extension, which would open up the route for more people to explore the region's picturesque landscapes and rich heritage, and I look forward to seeing how the proposal develops."
Scottish Borders Council leader Euan Jardine said they were making "significant strides" towards the extension of the line.
"We have already seen the positive impact the Waverley line has brought to the Borders," he said.
"This collaborative effort demonstrates the power of partnership in driving positive change and transforming our region for the better."

Headline: What is assisted dying and how could the law change?
Author: No author available

Text: MPs voted in support of a proposal to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, in November 2024.
Months of detailed scrutiny and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could become law.
At present, laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die.
The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill was introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater.
It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their life.
It says that anyone who wants to end their life must:
Once a patient's application has been approved, they would then have to wait 14 days before proceeding.
A doctor would prepare the substance being used to end the patient's life, but the person would take it themselves.
The bill defines the coordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with "training, qualifications and experience" at a level to be specified by the Health Secretary. It does not say which drug would be used.
It would be illegal to use dishonesty, pressure, or to coerce someone into declaring they want to end their life, with a possible 14-year prison sentence.
Under the original proposals, a High Court judge would have to approve each request to end a life.
However, Leadbetter has suggested a panel of legal and medical experts should oversee applications instead. The panel would be chosen by a new Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission which would be led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.
The proposal follows concerns that the High Court would not have capacity to rule on each individual case. However, some opponents have said the move undermines the bill's safeguards.
The change would need to be approved by the MPs scrutinising the bill.
Many months of activity lie ahead in the Commons and the Lords.
There are 23 MPs on the committee reviewing the legislation line-by-line. They include 14 supporters - including two ministers - and nine opponents.
The committee is holding public hearings and taking evidence from experts. It will then propose amendments to the bill.
It is hoped that the committee process will be finished in time for the bill to return to the House of Commons on 25 April.
At that stage, all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on the changes proposed by the committee.
There would then be more scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords, and further voting.
Even if the bill clears all its parliamentary hurdles, MPs have been told there would be a period of up to two years before any new law would be implemented.
It is possible the bill could fall and not become law at all.
The historic vote saw 330 MPs support the assisted dying bill, and 275 reject it.
MPs were given a free vote on the issue, which meant they could make their own decision rather than follow party instructions. The government is impartial on the issue.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among those to vote in favour of the bill, as was Chancellor Rachel Reeves.
However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood all voted against.
Most Conservative MPs rejected the bill, including party leader Kemi Badenoch. The former PM Rishi Sunak and former deputy PM Oliver Dowden were among the minority of Tory MPs who supported it.
When MPs last voted on the issue in 2015, they rejected different proposals by 330 votes to 118.
A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland.
Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur drafted the Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill.
If passed by MSPs, eligible applicants would have to:
The bill is being considered by the health committee ahead of an initial vote by MSPs. The first stage of the committee's work is due to be completed by 23 May 2025.
In October 2024, Scottish Health Secretary Neil Gray said the proposed legislation went beyond the limits of Holyrood's powers, and was a matter for Westminster.
However, McArthur said he was confident the UK and Scottish governments could find a solution if MSPs backed his bill.
Parts of the British Isles but able to set their own laws, the Isle of Man and Jersey are both considering proposals to allow assisted dying.
The Isle of Man's Assisted Dying Bill is reaching its final stages in the Manx parliament.
Adults expected to die within 12 months would be eligible.
And politicians are debating whether to reduce the residency criteria from five years (as specified in the bill) to 12 months.
Once the outstanding issues are resolved, the bill is likely to receive royal assent and become law, with the scheme potentially in place by 2027.
Jersey's politicians backed the principle of legalising assisted dying in 2021.
And in May 2024, they approved plans to allow assisted dying for those with a terminal illness "causing unbearable suffering".
Final legislation is currently being written, and once approved, an 18-month implementation period would begin, meaning new rules would take effect in summer 2027 at the earliest.
Opponents warn that people could be put under pressure to end their lives and want improvements to palliative care instead.
Paralympian and House of Lords crossbencher Baroness Grey-Thompson is a vocal critic.
She told the BBC she is worried about "the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, [the risk of] coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis".
Actor and disability-rights activist Liz Carr, who made BBC One documentary Better Off Dead?, also opposes changing the law.
"Some of us have very real fears based on our lived experience and based on what has happened in other countries where it's legal," she wrote on X.
Dr Gordon Macdonald, from campaign group Care Not Killing, said: "The safest law is the one we currently have.
"This bill is being rushed with indecent haste and ignores the deep-seated problems in the UK's broken and patchy palliative care system."
Leadbeater argues the law needs changing because some people "have a horrible, harrowing death", however good their end-of-life or palliative care is.
Cancer patient Nathaniel Dye worked on the bill with Leadbeater. He said it would allow people a death which was "as kind and compassionate as possible".
The Dignity in Dying campaign group said the bill provides the "most detailed, robust proposals" on the issue that "Westminster has ever considered".
According to chief executive Sarah Wootton, the fact that every year "up to 650 terminally ill people end their own lives, often in lonely and traumatic ways," shows that the status quo is not working.
One of the highest-profile advocates for change is broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage-four lung cancer.
"All I'm asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice," Dame Esther told BBC News. "If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die?"
Both the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, and the Royal College of Nursing are neutral on the issue.
There is some debate over exactly what the various terms mean.
However, assisted dying generally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves.
Assisted suicide is intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill. That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die.
Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician. Patients may not be terminally ill.
There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma.
The Dignity in Dying campaign group says more than 200 million people around the world have legal access to assisted dying.
Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Its Dignitas facility - which accepts foreign patients as well as Swiss nationals. Between 1998 and 2023 it helped 571 Britons to die.
Assisted suicide is also legal in Austria.
In the US, 11 states - Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, Maine and Washington DC - allow "physician-assisted dying".
It permits doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for self-administration.
Voluntary euthanasia is legal in Canada where it is called medical assistance in dying. It can be provided by a doctor or nurse practitioner, either in person or through the prescription of drugs for self-administration. Medically-assisted dying accounted for 4.7% of deaths in Canada in 2023.
It is also legal in Spain and Colombia, both of which also permit assisted suicide.
Assisted dying is legal in some parts of Australia but the law differs across states.
New Zealand's End of Life Choice Act legalises assisted dying and allows adults in their final months of life to request assistance from a medical professional.
Three countries have laws that allow people who are not terminally ill to receive assistance to die: The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

Headline: Stonewall jobs at risk after Trump's foreign aid cuts
Author: Jack Burgess & Tom McArthur, BBC News

Text: Stonewall has said it is trying to "meet the challenges of this new political era" after it was reported the LGBTQ+ charity could be forced to cut up to half of its staff in the wake of US President Donald Trump's overseas aid freeze.
The charity told the BBC "an organisation-wide consultation" has begun and said that "hard-won rights are being rolled back for marginalised communities across the world".
Only roles with dedicated funding would be safe, Stonewall's CEO Simon Blake told staff in a call on Thursday.
When asked by the BBC how much foreign aid spending cuts related to their decision, Stonewall said there are "a number of reasons for the consultation".
Stonewall has 114 employees, according to the UK charity commission website.
The charity's largest funder in recent years has been the Global Equality Fund (GEF), which is overseen by the US state department. It has given Stonewall more than £500,000 between 2021 and 2025.
Stonewall's accounts show the GEF granted it £137,254 in 2021-22, £204,442 in 2022-23 and £233,583 in 2023-24.
The GEF is a pooled fund from several countries and private business, with a focus on "advancing LGBTI rights around the world". But, according to the Times, it has not published accounts since 2015.
President Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending and has said it needs to be brought in line with his "America First" strategy. The US government has announced a freeze on funding for aid projects while it undertakes a "review" to ensure they align with Trump's priorities.
Mr Blake warned about the impact that Trump's policies would have on Stonewall and LGBTQ+ rights globally.
"The work to advocate for LGBTQ+ equality has never been more important and Stonewall is rising to meet the challenge," Stonewall said in a statement to the BBC.
"We are seeing an unprecedented political backlash against the principles of inclusion. Stonewall is adapting to ensure that it is fit for purpose and able to meet the challenges of this new political era."
The statement added that "many charities in the UK are facing tough choices for a range of reasons, including the economic environment. Stonewall is no different".
The charity also said that its work in eastern Europe is "a good example of the type of project that may cease if funding isn't replaced".
Stonewall's projects in eastern Europe help communities and law enforcement agencies to respond to anti-LGBTQ+ violence and provide "vital services to victims", according to Mr Blake.

Text: A man who experienced a "challenging" marriage proposal with his now-fiancée in Jersey due to ferry cancellations and access restrictions says it was "worth it".
Simon Tite, 42, from Coventry, planned to propose to partner Emma Francis, 39, at Plemont Bay on Saturday for their sixth anniversary.
But Mr Tite said strong winds led to the cancellation of a ferry from Poole in Dorset and repair work meant they were unable to access his desired beach for the proposal.
However, after success when he popped the question on board a boat, he said: "It couldn't have been any better. Despite the fact it was challenging to get there, it was 100,000% worth it."
Mr Tite said Plemont was Miss Francis's "favourite place in the world".
He said the pair drove to Poole on Thursday with the intention of catching the Condor Ferry on Friday.
He said: "We got to Poole and all the ferries were cancelled because of the weather.
"I was like: 'I do not believe this'.
"I desperately booked flights for us to come on the Friday from Southampton."
Mr Tite said the proposal plans were met with another obstacle after he discovered access to the preferred beach was blocked off due to repair work.
He said he contacted the government's infrastructure department to see if it would allow them to access the beach to walk on it.
Officials said no due to safety reasons.
Mr Tite said he then arranged a boat ride for the proposal, adding he planned for the pair to swim into the bay
He said he hired wetsuits but the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) company said there "was no way" the pair could get into the water due to the strong winds.
Mr Tite said: "The wind and the waves were just amazingly massive."
He then popped the question on board the RIB at sea.
Miss Francis said: "I had a face like thunder because I'd been told, in February: 'You're gonna put a wetsuit on.
"Every turn it was: 'Oh, we're not doing this now.'
"I didn't know what was happening at all."
However, despite that the "bizarre" experience and eventually realising what was happening, Mrs Tite-to-be said the location was "perfect".

Headline: Factory closure plans could see 128 jobs lost

Text: More than 120 jobs are at risk under plans to close a North Yorkshire dairy factory.
Milk production firm Arla said it planned to close its Settle site by the end of 2026, putting 128 roles there under threat.
The company, which is headquartered in Leeds, plans to move more of its operations to its Lockerbie site in Scotland, including some that are currently based in Stourton, Leeds.
Deanne Ferguson from the GMB union said the closure would be "a devastating blow for the dedicated workers at Settle and for the local community which relies on this key employer".
Arla Foods' vice president of production, Fran Ball, said the company would be entering into a period of consultation with its employees over the plans.
Ms Ball said the proposals "form part of our strategy to strengthen our manufacturing network and futureproof dairy production in the UK".
An Arla spokesperson said it "remains committed to being a major employer in the Yorkshire region".
The spokesperson said more than 1,000 people were employed in Leeds, including about 500 people at the company's headquarters in Leeds Valley Park and a further 450 people at its dairy in Stourton.
No jobs were under threat in Leeds, they added, although about 24 roles would be impacted due to the changes.
Last year the company invested £65m investment in its Stourton site, according to the spokesperson.
The company said it planned to invest almost £90m into its Lockerbie site, creating 90 new jobs.
The plans include creating a UHT milk "centre of excellence". UHT and lacto-free milk is currently produced in Settle.
Ms Ferguson said the closure would have "a significant economic and social impact".
"We will now begin urgent discussions with Arla to explore all possible options to protect jobs.
"We call on Arla and all stakeholders to engage in full and transparent discussions about the future of the workforce and to consider all available alternatives to compulsory redundancies."

Text: A woman living in Ukraine said she is "very grateful" for the support of people from Guernsey.
Natalia Polischuk, from Kyiv, has shared her thanks on the day that marked three years since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.
Islanders have stepped up to help in many ways, including knitting and sending thousands of baby hats, taking on daring challenges to raise funds, and even driving to and from the borders to deliver vital aid.
Marc Laine, who delivered small generators to Ukraine, said he felt compelled to help residents of the country.
He said: "The first time we went [to Ukraine], we took generators and we were welcomed everywhere - there was a lot of comradery.
"I was inspired by everyone we met - if they weren't involved directly in the conflict, they were doing something to help in their own time, there was so much enthusiasm.
"People in Guernsey have been great, Humanitarian Aid Guernsey are fantastic - they have shipped massive donations from the public to Ukraine."
Ms Polischuk said: "I think the support is important and we are very grateful for the people of Guernsey.
"I do believe that the generators saved numerous lives in the winters - a lot of places was out of electricity for hours.
"Those generators helped to sustain schools, kindergartens, hospitals - I know that Marc and his team brought smaller generators which helped military hospitals.
"The support is greatly appreciated - the fact that many people from around the world helped... that was huge."

Text: A yoga teacher who was stabbed five times during the Southport attack has told the BBC how she feared "everyone was going to die" as she desperately tried to protect the young children.
On 29 July, Axel Rudakubana moved through the sold-out Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop – organised by Leanne Lucas with dance teacher Heidi Liddle – and stabbed young girls who had been making friendship bracelets and singing along to music. Three of the girls died.
Ms Lucas spoke to BBC Panorama about the day of the attack, her efforts to help children to safety, and the riots that followed.
She described how she called 999 as the attacker chased after her and several children.
She also revealed how misinformation spread following the attack, including social media messages blaming her for the deaths.

The 14-year-old, whose identity is protected by a court order and who the BBC is calling Sarah, was left with life-threatening injuries when Axel Rudakubana attacked children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop.
Interviewed alongside her parents, Sarah, who managed to guide several other children to safety, recalls how people were in a "blind panic".
Sarah said "false information" on social media was one of the reasons she wanted to tell her story and that in the future she would like to take part in anti-knife campaigns.

Text: A yoga teacher who almost died in the Southport attack has described for the first time the desperate moments when she helped several children run to safety, despite having been stabbed five times.
Leanne Lucas told BBC Panorama how she called 999 as the attacker chased after them. "I just knew that if I didn't get out, everyone was going to die," she said.
A 13-year-old helping to run the class, whom we are calling Sarah, also told the BBC that attacker Axel Rudakubana looked "possessed" as he stabbed her.
Leanne and Sarah are the first survivors who escaped the room to speak publicly. Ten people were injured and three children were killed in the attack last July.
Sarah - who is now 14 and whose identity is protected by a court order - was seriously wounded but managed to lead several other children, including her younger sister, to safety.
Sitting alongside her parents, she told us how another "incredible" girl, who appeared to be only about 10 years old, was keeping other children calm, telling them: "Don't worry, your parents are going to be here, everything's going to be OK."
The two survivors of the attack, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop, recounted how they had helped others escape the terrifying violence and how neighbours had rushed to their aid.
They also revealed how misinformation spread following the attack, including messages on social media blaming Leanne for the deaths. Leanne and Sarah both expressed shock at how authorities had missed warning signs about the attacker.
"It's so shocking how much evidence they had on him, how he slipped through the net," said Leanne.
"You see the best and the worst at the same time," said Sarah, who described seeing "the evil side of people" in Rudakubana's violence and "all the good of all the community coming together as well to help everyone".
With the mammoth Eras tour reaching the UK, the summer of 2024 was Taylor Swift's summer. So when children's yoga instructor Leanne Lucas and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, organised a workshop themed around the singer, it sold out within a week.
Twenty-five little girls, the youngest five years old, signed up for a morning of dancing, yoga, and making friendship bracelets at the Hart Space studio on 29 July. Sarah offered to help the two teachers and took photos at the event.
As the session was drawing to a close, Leanne gathered all of the children together. "We went round the circle and they said how they were feeling and one of the little girls said: 'This is the best day of my life'," Leanne said.
The girl, nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, died later that night. Seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King were also killed in the attack.
Rudakubana, the killer, had arrived by taxi, wearing a bright green hoodie and a medical face mask that covered his mouth. Dashcam footage shows him trying a locked door at the Hart Space before walking through an open doorway and heading up the stairs.
Leanne saw the attacker briefly through the window, but she had no idea who he was – or that he posed a threat. The next thing she knew, he was in the room.
"He opened the door and grabbed a child. I don't know what he was doing. I didn't see anything. He then grabbed the next child, and the next child. And then I shout: 'Who is that?'"
Sarah was one of the first to be attacked. "I saw him stab a child in front of me. And then I saw the knife coming towards me and him coming towards me," she said.
"And that's when I saw it go into my arm. And that's when I turned and he must have got my back, but I didn't feel it at the time, because of the adrenaline."
The attacker made his way through the room, before reaching their teacher.
"He moves through the girls by the table and moves next to me," Leanne told us, reliving the scene in her mind. "I just felt something go in my back and my brain just said – he got me."
Leanne suffered five stab wounds – to her spine, her head, her ribs, her lung, and her shoulder blade. Despite this, she managed to get herself and several of the girls out of the room and call the police.
"I just knew that if I didn't get out everyone was going to die," she told us, wiping tears from her eyes.
"He was bigger than me. And I just thought: I need to get some help. So we all run towards the door. We were shouting: 'Run!' I called 999 on the landing and I asked for the police."
She said she then saw a flash of green - the attacker's hoodie - "and I go into panic mode and he's chasing us".
It's clear that more children would have died if the teachers and Sarah hadn't taken the action they did.
At Rudakubana's sentencing, the judge said Leanne "tried to save as many children as she could" while being attacked, and that "she did all she could before escaping".
Leanne says: "The police said we'd all be dead if me and Heidi [fellow organiser] hadn't done what we'd done and that gives nothing for the children who did die... that doesn't take that away."
But like many of those who saved lives that day, she still torments herself.
Sarah was left with life-threatening injuries and fractures to two of her spinal vertebrae.
"I remember seeing the girls all like huddling around the stairs," she told us calmly. "So I remember shouting for them to get down and get out. So I was physically pushing them down the stairs to get everyone out.
"I thought that he wasn't going to stop until he killed everyone. I thought that he wanted to kill us all."
Despite her injuries, Sarah managed to lead several other children out of the Hart Space, up the driveway and across the street, where local resident Steve was fixing his garden wall.
Sarah told him she had been stabbed and thought she was dying, but Steve reassured her and led the children into his house. "Everyone was in a blind panic," Sarah told us.
Steve describes Sarah as "a hero". "She led all them kids away."
He and his wife began taking care of the children. One of the girls who had been stabbed was "tiny", Steve recalled, and he could see others were injured too.
Meanwhile, James Dixon had heard the screams while working at the garage next door to the Hart Space.
"As a parent, you can tell the difference between a scream of play and a scream of terror," he said. "And this was – nightmares, pain. They were terrified."
A parent was in her car, calling the police, with five or six children in the back. One appeared to be seriously injured. James ran over to another child who had collapsed.
"She asked me: 'Am I going to die?' Which just breaks your heart, but I told her no," he said. She was so badly injured he was afraid his reassurance might not be true. "I focused everything on her to make sure to keep her alive."
James saved the seven-year-old girl's life.
Two more workers from the garage, Colin Parry and Julian Medlock, had rushed over to help. They saw Leanne, leaning against a car, "completely in shock", said Colin.
He asked her if she needed help, but she told him: "Just look after the girls. Just look after the girls."
"My brain is going 100 miles an hour but my body won't do anything," Leanne recalled. "And there are people asking me questions and I am saying: 'Go and get the children.'
"I just don't know what else I could have done," she said.
At the same time, window cleaner Joel Verite had spotted Leanne as he was driving past on his round. He screeched to a halt and saw her point up to the studio, saying that a man was stabbing children up there.
Businessman Jon Hayes, who had been working in an adjoining office, had also been stabbed after confronting the attacker.
Joel raced inside, shouting as he climbed the stairs. He saw Rudakubana standing at the top of the staircase.
"We locked eyes for a brief second. He's got a knife," Joel said. "My life flashed before my eyes. Who else is with him? Who is going to come behind me?"
Steve had run over from his house, armed with hammers. He met Joel, who had stepped back from the staircase after facing off with the knifeman. "We had a little chat to ourselves and said, right, are we going to go in and do him or what?" Steve said.
But at that moment, the police arrived. They entered the studio with a Taser, subdued Rudakubana and arrested him.
Steve said he saw the police knocking on the locked door of one of the toilets. Inside was Heidi Liddle, Leanne's friend. After helping some of the children escape, she had found an eight-year-old girl hiding in a toilet and had saved her by locking them both inside.
It was now noon - the time when the workshop had been due to end - and the street had filled with distraught parents looking for their children.
Sarah's dad arrived and saw Joel carrying a child. "My initial thought was, God - and I just ran for the building," he told us. But Steve was telling parents that many of the children were sheltering at his house.
There, the door was open and his youngest daughter came out. "I just gripped tight, ever so hard. She goes, 'I'm fine. I'm fine'."
Still outside the Hart Space studio, Sarah's mum saw "blood everywhere". "There were bloody hands on cars," she said. "When I looked up, I just saw my husband at the end of the street. He was waving me over and I just ran towards him. I just tried not to look at anything or anyone."
Leanne and eight children - including Sarah - were treated for life-threatening injuries.
"I asked someone if I was going to die," Leanne said. "And she didn't say no. She's just said 'you're in the best place'." Leanne said she heard someone discuss possible paralysis and something about her lungs.
Sarah was taken to the same hospital, where her father was told they had had to operate on her lung, which had collapsed from a puncture wound.
While Leanne recovered from life-saving surgery, rioting began, first in Southport, then spreading across the UK, following false rumours that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. She said she was targeted on social media by people who blamed her for the children's deaths.
"I just was scared of everybody. And still thinking it was all my fault. If I hadn't arranged the day, if I had never advertised in certain places, if I hadn't used that studio," she said.
She saw videos of riots taking place on her own street. "I was like, are they trying to get me?"
Sarah told us "disinformation" on social media was one of the reasons she wanted to tell her story - "to get my voice and the truth out there to everyone".
Others who acted bravely on that day share Leanne's sense of disbelief and turmoil. "Those screams haunt me," says James, who saved a seven-year-old girl's life. "I'd think to myself, if I ran a little bit quicker, a little bit braver, took a weapon..."
We first met Leanne in January. She had endured six months of waiting for her attacker to be tried. But on the day his trial was due to begin, Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to three charges of murder and 10 of attempted murder. For Leanne, this was another act of malice.
"I found out he pleaded guilty on the news," Leanne recalled. "I felt so angry. We knew he did it. He knew he did it. Every single person knew he did it. And he waited until the day of trial to say guilty and put every single family, victim, witness - everyone in that position."
For many witnesses in the case, Rudakubana's last-minute guilty plea – however manipulative in its timing – was a relief. Many were dreading the prospect of sitting in a courtroom with their attacker while lawyers pored over the details of the injuries he had inflicted.
Sarah, however, wanted her day in court, saying she'd had all the "stress and anxiety" without the "closure".
Rudakubana was sentenced to 52 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed because he was 17 years old when he carried out the attack.
Leanne said she wanted to speak out now because, even after the court proceedings, she still did not feel the "absolute trauma" of that day had been understood. "I just feel like I am able to be the voice of people you can't hear who are involved in the story," she said.
On the day her attacker was sentenced, Leanne spoke about the survivor's guilt she lives with. "I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died," she told the court. She said she was struggling to trust others and trying to see the goodness in the world. "For Alice, Elsie, Bebe, Heidi and the surviving girls, I'm surviving for you," she said.
She told us about treasured moments with each of the girls who died. She described Bebe's "pure excitement" at holding a puppy during a puppy yoga session. The day of the attack was the first time Leanne had met Alice, and the "beautiful smile" of this "confident ballerina" left an impression. And she recalled Elsie's enthusiasm for the weekly reading and writing lessons they had together.
It is clear that their memory is what keeps her going.
"These children represent goodness, I think. Just pure goodness," she told us. "Happiness. How genuine they were. Positive. The love of life and just making the best out of every single moment. That's how I remember them."

Headline: William at his lowest after Kate's diagnosis, says ex-aide
Author: Guy Lambert, Culture reporter
Published Date: 2025-02-23T16:13:10.057Z
Text: A former aide to the Prince of Wales has said the royal was at his "lowest" after the Princess of Wales was diagnosed with cancer.
In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia, Jason Knauf, formerly the chief executive of William and Kate's Royal Foundation, said: "It was awful, absolutely awful. It's the lowest I've ever seen him.
"Within a couple of weeks, if you're Prince William, you find out that both your wife and your father have cancer. I couldn't believe it."
Both the King and the Princess of Wales were treated for cancer last year. Kate is now in remission and Charles is having ongoing treatment.
Mr Knauf, 43, stepped down from his position at the end of 2021.
Catherine's diagnosis was made public in March last year, and Mr Knauf said: "The problem was that all this crazy conspiracy theory stuff kicked off in the background, online. 'Was she really ill?'.
"But they didn't want to say yet that she had cancer because they hadn't told the children and they were still working through how to tell the children."
Speaking to reporters last year at the end of his visit to South Africa, Prince William, 42, talked about how he has coped after both his wife and his father were diagnosed with cancer, describing the past year as the "hardest year" of his life.
"It's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult," he said after being asked how his year has been after a difficult year for the Royal Family."
Mr Knauf also previously worked for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
In October 2018, while working for the couple as their communications secretary, Mr Knauf made a bullying complaint against Meghan.
He wrote of his concerns to William's then private secretary in an email, in an apparent attempt to force Buckingham Palace to protect staff.
The duchess's legal team strenuously denied the allegation.
Discussing William's relationship with Harry, Mr Knauf said: "It's very difficult to have this stuff play out in the public eye, but he's chosen to keep his thoughts on it private, and I think all of us who know him really have to respect that we should do the same.
"But I will say, of course, it's been hard and sad, especially for all of us who know both of them.
"I worked really closely with the two of them and we had lots of great times."
Mr Knauf has previously expressed regret in not giving evidence in the Duchess of Sussex's High Court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the Court of Appeal.
Meghan won her privacy case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) in 2021, when the High Court found its publication of her letter to her father - sent in August 2018 - was unlawful.
Mr Knauf was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (RVO) in the 2023 New Year Honours List.
Before joining the royal household the American-born former corporate affairs executive worked for a range of institutions, from the office of the New Zealand prime minister to HM Treasury and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Mr Knauf led a review of the Royal Foundation's role and structure from March 2019, before becoming its chief executive in September of that year.
He oversaw the launch of the Foundation's Earthshot Prize - William's £50 million environmental prize, now an independent charity, which recognises solutions, ideas and technologies that "repair the planet".

Headline: Writer wanted to make Bergerac role 'more complex'
Author: Shivani Chaudhari & Mark Hardie, BBC News, Essex
Published Date: 2025-02-23T06:07:25.420Z
Text: The writer of a Bergerac reboot said he wanted to develop the leading role to make it "more complex".
The Jersey-based detective series originally ran on BBC One from 1981 to 1991 and starred John Nettles.
Toby Whithouse, born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said he had tried to make the show more "labyrinth" and wanted to "test and challenge" the character of Jim.
Set to premiere on 27 February, the new series stars Damien Molony, alongside Zoë Wanamaker and Philip Glenister.
The show followed a maverick detective and recovering alcoholic adept at solving complex crimes.
Nettles became a household name due to its success and said he was offered a cameo role but turned it down.
Mr Whithouse, whose previous work includes Doctor Who, wanted "to stay true" to the programme's roots while offering something new.
He said: "I absolutely wanted to do something that was more complex and more labyrinth and also allowed us to then to develop Jim as a character and to test and challenge him.
"So fans of the original will go away feeling like the show has been respected, and new people, who have come with no baggage or expectations, still really enjoy it."
He told BBC Essex the writing process was far from easy as it was unlike anything he had written before.
"I don't really tend to do police procedure shows, I do more high-concept genres.
"I started to have an idea for the main character and how I would write him and reinvent him.
"In the original show, Jim Bergerac was a recovering alcoholic, which is something that I really wanted to use but we've taken it in a slightly different, more realistic direction."
One of the key changes in the modern version is there will be one story per series instead of one story per week.
Bergerac is available on U and U&DRAMA from 27 February.

Headline: Three arrested over man's 2002 disappearance

Text: Three people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a man who went missing more than 20 years ago.
Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer in Scotland a few months earlier.
A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found.
Northumbria Police said it had now arrested two men, in their 40s and 50s, as well as a woman in her 40s on suspicion of murder.
Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance.
Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements.
Police are still searching an address in the Coronation Street area which is a location Mr Clive is known to have visited on the evening he went missing.
Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries.
Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne.
His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were "still in limbo" as they did not believe he fell into the river.
Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said: "We are doing everything we can to provide Scott's family with the answers they deserve.
"We still believe there could be key information that people know in the local community."
He said: "I am again urging anybody who lived on Coronation Street at the time of his disappearance, or has information about Scott's movements that night, to come forward.
"The information you have could prove key in our investigations."

Headline: More struggling councils to sell assets and borrow cash
Author: Paul Seddon, Political reporter
Published Date: 2025-02-21T17:53:09.490Z
Text: The government has agreed to relax budgeting rules for a record 29 English councils to allow them to balance their books next year.
The authorities will be allowed to use Treasury loans or cash from selling assets to cover day-to-day spending, which they are normally banned from doing.
The figure is up from 19 that requested such flexibility this year, further underscoring the continued financial fragility of the sector.
Ministers will, however, encourage councils not to sell off "community and heritage assets" to help meet current spending pressures.
It remains to be seen what this means in practice, with the government leaving it to authorities to decide which assets meet this definition.
Councils in England will have £69.4bn to spend next year, assuming they increase council tax by the maximum allowed, a 4.3% real-terms rise from this year.
But local leaders argue this will not cover the increasing cost of mandatory services such as adult social care and special educational needs, which have eaten up a growing share of their budgets in recent years.
On Thursday, the government confirmed 29 councils have requested additional wriggle room to balance their budgets next year, worth a collective £1.5bn, under financial support rules introduced during the Covid pandemic.
Details of how exactly each council plans to balance its books will be published at a later date in a series of so-called capitalisation directions.
They include six councils - Birmingham, Croydon, Woking, Nottingham, Thurrock and Slough - that have effectively declared bankruptcy in recent years and requested similar help last year.
Those asking for the flexibility for the first time include Enfield, Worcestershire, West Berkshire, Trafford, Barnet, Solihull, and Halton.
Nineteen were given such flexibility this year, up from eight in 2023, which in turn was more than the five receiving it in 2022.
The 29 councils will be able to use money raised through selling assets, such as land and buildings, to cover their day-to-day spending costs.
Normally town halls can only use cash from such asset sales on projects designed to reduce their operating costs, such as merging back-office functions or moving services online.
They will also be allowed to cover current spending using Treasury-backed loans normally reserved for long-term investment.
The government has also confirmed it is removing a 1% surcharge on using Treasury loans in this way, with local government minister Jim McMahon saying the government believed in "partnership - not punishment".
The premium, which some council leaders have compared to the fees on pay-day loans, was previously seen as a way to encourage councils into selling assets rather than going for government lending.
London Councils, an umbrella group for authorities in the capital, said the extra budget flexibility was a "short-term measure" that "leaves us with more long-term debts to worry about".
The government argues changes such as allowing councils to set multi-year budgets, a Labour manifesto pledge, will allow them to put themselves on a more secure financial footing.
Ministers are also consulting on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026, as part of a wider shake-up of council financing.
They argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally.
They have promised the new formula will take into account the "impact of rurality" - but they could have a political row on their hands, with Conservative-run councils in more rural areas likely to argue they are being unfairly funded.

Headline: Bench washed 80 miles in storm returned to family

Text: A tribute bench found on a beach 80 miles from where it was washed into the sea during a storm is set to be reunited with a family - who say the "heartwarming" effort of locals to track them down "restores your faith in people".
The wooden seat made in tribute to Warrington man Bill Batcock was pulled into the Irish Sea off Anglesey in December, before travelling 80 miles (130km) and resurfacing on the Cumbrian coast.
It was stumbled upon by members of a local Facebook group who tracked down the man's daughter, Helen Wharton, to tell her the bench had been found.
"Dad was such an adventurer, to think he's made a break for it to go on another adventure, it just makes me smile really," she said.
Ms Wharton said she and her family had "no idea" the bench had gone missing during Storm Darragh in December.
She said she was shocked to receive a message on social media with an image of the bench wedged between sand dunes on Drigg beach near Seascale, Cumbria, asking: "Is this yours?"
"I couldn't believe it, it was all so strange," said Ms Wharton, who lives in Padgate, Warrington.
The bench was erected on some exposed headland at Bull Bay on Anglesey to commemorate Mr Batcock, a lover of the Welsh coast and mountains, who died of leukaemia in 2018.
He asked for the bench to be placed there "as he wanted to look out across the sea, across the coast and mountains, towards home", she said.
Words from one of his poems had been inscribed on a plaque on the bench, which read: "For me, it has to be the sea."
Ms Wharton told BBC Radio Manchester the message was now "quite ironic" given the remarkable journey of the bench.
She said the campaign to return the bench was "really lovely", adding the words on the plaque had intrigued local people.
Megan O'Gorman, who runs the local Facebook group in which a member messaged to say they had found the bench, said she was determined to track down the family.
"I thought right, who is this person, where has this bench travelled from," she said.
Ms Wharton said: "It's just typical if you think of my dad, nothing would tie him down."
She and her family plan to travel to Cumbria on Friday to collect the bench and return it to its home on Anglesey.

Text: Two people have been arrested in a series of police raids in Dundee as the result of an investigation into county lines drug dealing and human trafficking.
A 63-year-old man was arrested in the Stobswell area of Dundee shortly after 07:15 following a raid by specialist officers.
Four hours later, a 23-year-old woman was arrested after officers raided a flat in the Hilltown.
A 26-year-old man has also been arrested by police in the West Midlands following simultaneous raids in Birmingham and Wolverhampton.
Police officers remain at both properties following the arrests, which were made as the result of intelligence gathered as part of the inquiry.
County lines is where drugs, including heroin and cocaine, are moved across the country - the 'county line' itself is a mobile phone number where orders are placed for the drugs.
Vulnerable adults and children are often used to sell the drugs, with some people moved from their local area to another part of the country to sell drugs, often to pay off a debt.
The Dundee raids were carried out as part of Operation Spignel, a joint operation with police in the West Midlands.
Dundee-based Det Insp Alan Swanston from Police Scotland said: "We've identified a serious organised crime group that are operating out of the West Midlands area and drug dealing in Dundee.
"Specialist officers will also develop and assess the intelligence and build a picture of what the group looks like and where they're located."
Specialist resources are also being made available for the operation, including cybercrime officers.
Det Insp Swanston said: "The arrests will allow us to conduct interviews, examine any phones or devices that have been obtained and also be able to go through the addresses with a fine toothcomb to identify if there is evidence that would back up the intelligence."

Text: Consultation on a planned power line that would see a 31-mile pylon route built from Wales to Shropshire has begun.
The Vyrnwy Frankton Project, a scheme to build a new substation near Cefn Coch in Powys and connect it to the national network at Lower Frankton in Shropshire, includes underground cables and an overhead line.
Six consultation events have been set up in village halls and community centres from 27 February to 8 March by Green Gen Cymru.
People will be able to view a digital 3D model of the route, the company said.
This is expected to be the final route-wide consultation before a planning application is submitted.
North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan has called on the company to consider building the route underground and said communities would be affected visually and by noise.
Senior project manager Sean Taylor said the company had considered areas important for tourism and recreation, adding: "The route is planned to keep effects on these as low as we can, while balancing the effects on the landscape and the environment."
Addressing effects on communities, he said: "We have carefully considered views to and from villages in designing the connection. As much as possible, we've used woodland and the natural shape of the landscape to help reduce potential visual effects."
Mr Taylor said the project was "still open to influence" and the firm was committed to working closely with communities and stakeholders.
In Shropshire, consultation events are being held at West Felton Village Hall on 27 February, Hordley & Bagley Village Hall on 28 February and Llanymynech Village Hall on 1 March.
Events will be held in Wales at Llanfair Caereinion Public Hall on 6 March, Llansantffraid Community Centre on 7 March and Meifod Village Hall Community Centre on 8 March.
The consultation will close on 16 April.

Published Date: 2025-02-19T13:14:47.276Z
Text: The Channel Islands is set to be served by a fourth ferry firm after operator Islands Unlimited published its inter-island summer schedule.
It follows a decision by Jersey and Guernsey's governments to choose different ferry firms to operate their main sea links for the next 15 years, with French firm Manche Iles also offering a passenger ferry.
Jersey's government opted for Danish firm DFDS, while Guernsey chose to stay with Condor - both have indicated they plan to operate limited services between the islands, but timetables have not yet been published.
Islands Unlimited managing director Chad Murray said: "We are excited that we will be offering a daily inter-island foot passenger service this summer."
Mr Murray said a standard adult return fare with his firm would be priced at about £67.
The firm's schedule offers daily services between Guernsey and Jersey, running from 07:00 until 19:45 on weekdays (other than Tuesdays when it stops at 16:45).
It will also run from 07:00 until 21:45 at weekends.
Mr Murray said the new summer schedule would be subject to "some final discussions" with Ports of Jersey.
The firm's boss said: "We want to meet the needs of the islanders, as well as visitors.
"Following stakeholder engagement, this offers the best fit for the communities, commuters, local business, sport and event, as well as offering great day trips for visitors to support tourism."
Islands Unlimited has said its service could start in June.
Chairman of the Guernsey Tourism Partnership, Ant Ford-Parker, said: "We are delighted that this bold initiative is nearing completion.
"The implications for tourism as well as the local communities are enormous.
"We wish them every success."

Headline: Anti-Muslim hate at record level in UK, report says
Author: Jessica Rawnsley, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-19T12:03:03.016Z
Text: Anti-Muslim hate in the UK surged to record levels last year, an organisation tracking Islamophobia has found.
Almost 6,000 reports to Tell Mama were confirmed by it as anti-Muslim incidents, more than double the number two years ago, with men targeted more than women for the first time since the body was founded in 2012.
In its report the organisation said there had been a "surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers" following the Israel-Gaza conflict and Southport murders.
A government spokesperson called the findings "extremely concerning" and said it would "seek to stamp out anti-Muslim hatred and racism wherever it occurs".
A total of 6,313 cases of anti-Muslim hate were recorded by Tell Mama in 2024, a 43% increase on the previous year - with 5,837 of the reports verified by the group.
The organisation, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said it had documented a steep rise in offline incidents, with 3,680 cases reported - a 72% increase on the number two years ago.
The majority of the in-person cases were abusive behaviour, with Tell Mama also recording incidents of physical assault, discrimination and vandalism. Most of the attacks took place in public areas such as streets and parks, with a minority occurring in the workplace.
For the first time since Tell Mama's inception in 2012, more men than women were targeted by anti-Muslim hate and Islamophobia, the organisation said.
Tell Mama said that shift reflected "the deepening impact of harmful stereotypes that fuel societal divisions and reinforces false notions about Muslim identities".
Anti-Muslim attacks surged in the UK following both the Southport murders last July and the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October 2023.
According to the report, more than half of the online incidents of Islamophobia last year took place after three girls were murdered at a dance class in Southport. The majority of these occurred on the social media platform X - formerly known as Twitter.
Following the murders, misinformation about the assailant's identity proliferated online, fuelling civil unrest that spread across the UK.
Axel Rudakubana, an 18-year-old born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents who had settled in Britain, is serving a minimum 52-year sentence for the murders.
Tell Mama said that there had been a "surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers" since both the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and the 2024 riots sparked by the Southport murders.
Iman Atta, the group's director, called for coordinated action by the government and said: "As anti-Muslim hate continues to be felt by a greater number of British Muslims, both at a street and online level, our work and support for victims of anti-Muslim hate is needed now more than ever."
The public must "stand together against hatred and extremism", she said, and urged those in positions of influence to "consider how their language risks stereotyping communities and how it unduly influences discussions online and offline".
In response to the findings, the government said that "attacks on and hatred against Muslim communities are completely unacceptable and have no place in our society".
A spokesperson added: "We are absolutely determined to bridge divisions between communities and are working closely with community groups, charities, and public sector partners to tackle hatred in all its forms."

Headline: New knife laws will make difference, says victim's sister
Author: Ruth Green and Rowan Bridge, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-19T11:19:44.984Z
Text: Stricter rules for selling knives online and tougher penalties for those who break them will make a difference, the sister of a teenager killed with a ninja sword has said.
The new measures announced by the government will be known as Ronan's Law - after 16-year-old Ronan Kanda who was murdered close to his home three years ago after being stabbed in the back and chest in a case of mistaken identity.
"On the day of my brother's murder, his murderer had no problem with collecting the knives from the local post office," Nikita Kanda told Radio 4's Today programme, adding "no checks" had been made.
It comes as policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson on Thursday pledged all potential avenues will be explored as part of the government's mission to halve knife crime over the next decade.
Ronan was killed by fellow school pupil Prabjeet Veadhesa, after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022.
A trial heard his attacker, who was also 16, at the time had mistaken him for his friend, their intended victim.
He used a 22-inch sword he had ordered online using his mother's ID to pass security checks.
It was one of nearly 30 knives and machetes he had bought using the same method over several months.
As part of the new rules which are to be introduced in the spring, retailers across England and Wales will be required to report any bulk or suspicious knife purchases to police.
The jail term for selling weapons to under-18s will increase from six months to two years and a new policing unit backed with £1m of funding to monitor for weapons being sold illegally on social media will also be created.
Asked about the plans, his sister told the BBC that having some sort of punishment in place was "better than nothing", adding there needed to be more accountability for "people who are a part of the problem but who are overlooked".
"All I can ever do is reflect on my brother's case, and on the day of my brother's murder, the murderer, he didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office, and the fact that he was under-age, so no checks were performed."
She said: "So I really do think that these, these measures can make a difference, and they will make a difference because it will make it harder."
She described Ronan as the "light of our life, the best brother anyone could ask for".
Since her son's death, Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, has campaigned for fundamental changes to the law to make it harder for people to sell and buy knives.
"The online sale of bladed articles played a crucial role in this tragedy. A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people. I knew we could not go on like this."
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Kanda said she "absolutely" believed her son would not have died if the new legislation had been in place at the time of his death in 2022.
"The murderers would not have been able to get the weapons they were able to get so easily. Nobody was able to stop them, and they were just 16," she said.
On the new law she said: "Out of tragedy comes a light. The light we all need." However, she stressed "there's so much more we can do" when tackling the root causes of knife crime.
Introduced as part of the government's Crime and Policing Bill in the spring, the rules are in response to a review by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) into the online sale of knives.
The changes will also see:
Policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said "nothing is off the table" in regards to knife crime as she described it as "absolutely disgraceful" that retailers were selling knives to under 18s.
Speaking about Ronan's death on the Today programme she said: "There was no check that day when the ninja sword, the 20-inch ninja sword was collected at the post office - nobody checked it."
She paid tribute to his family, who she described as at the "forefront" of bringing the bill forward and said the new rules would acknowledge the "problem" of supply of weapons, rather than just possession, with "proper sentencing".
The Home Office said the new measures would significantly tighten the law, which until now has been less stringent than the legislation covering the sale of alcohol, tobacco, fireworks or even scratch cards.
"It is horrifying how easy it is for young people to get hold of knives online," said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. "Even though children's lives are being lost, and families and communities are left devastated as a result."
Commander Stephen Clayman, who led the NPCC review into online knife sales, said: "Bizarrely it is harder to buy paracetamol in some respects than it is to buy a knife - that can't be right.
"We want to make retailers more responsible for what they are selling."
The recommendations also require social media companies to be more accountable for the "thousands of knives" that Cdr Clayman said were being sold on platforms.
"They are being quite clever about it in the way they don't overtly sell. But they show all the knives and encourage people to move to a different [online] platform to make the transaction.
"If they are selling knives and we can prove it, we will take legal action and ask for the content to be removed."
The measures are aimed at stopping sellers like Stefan Petrescu from Southampton.
He used Instagram to sell hundreds of knives. Police found receipts which revealed that Petrescu had bulk-bought more than £3,000-worth of knives, which he had then sold online.
Messages from Petrescu's seized phone showed the use of social media platforms to market the knives, with buyers saying they wanted to "shank" (stab) or harm others.
In one video, he wears a black balaclava-style mask and gloves while handling knives, advertising his stock of serrated machetes, knuckle dusters and other blades while drill music plays in the background - including the song "Ready for War".
In October 2024, Petrescu was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to knife-related offences.
The home secretary has said the government is on a "mission" to halve knife crime over the next 10 years.
There were 262 murders in England and Wales involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year to March 2024, according to the Ben Kinsella Trust. Fifty-seven of those killed were under 25.

Headline: Cancer patients not getting right treatment, say doctors
Author: Nick Triggle, Health correspondent•@nicktriggle, •
Published Date: 2025-02-19T00:07:56.942Z
Text: Senior doctors responsible for monitoring cancer care in England and Wales are concerned failings in NHS services are contributing to up to half of patients not getting the right treatment for some cancers.
In evidence provided to the BBC, the National Cancer Audit Collaborating Centre (NatCan) highlighted particular problems with prostate, kidney and colon cancers.
The expert group said it had found significant variation between hospitals and warned the problems accessing nationally-recommended treatments were putting lives at risk.
It carries out audits across nine major cancers - responsible for 80% of cases - and has found shortfalls across a range of different cancer types and stages.
Figures shared with the BBC show:
NatCan said while a minority of patients would be choosing not to have treatment themselves and others may not be well enough, that could not fully explain the scale of the shortfall or variation between hospitals.
Governments in both nations say improving services is a key priority and England is in the process of drawing up a new cancer strategy, which ministers say will revolutionise services.
Ian Pattison's case highlights the value of getting the right treatment. He was diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer in 2020, at the age of 65.
It had started spreading to nearby organs and he was offered the nationally-recommended treatment of hormone therapy and radiotherapy for his particular type of cancer.
He said the treatment was brutal but, now aged 70, his cancer is in remission and he is enjoying life.
Mr Pattison, from Durham, said: "I was lucky that I live close to a specialist cancer centre in Newcastle where I could get the best treatment.
"It was hard going through it all and coping with the side effects but I am so thankful I got the treatment.
"I feel fit and well. I love walking, spending time with my family and looking after the grandchildren."
But Prof Ajay Aggarwal, clinical director at NatCan, which is run by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) for NHS England and the Welsh government, said it was concerning so many patients were not getting the recommended treatment, adding that the variation was hard to understand.
"We need to do better," he said. "With cancer, we often hear people talking about what the next breakthrough is but, the fact remains, using what we have better could make a huge difference. It would extend and save lives."
Prof Aggarwal said there were likely to be several reasons for the problems and variation, including some services unfairly assuming older patients could not cope with treatment, as well as problems with staffing and capacity.
He said there was evidence of smaller hospitals not always referring patients on to specialist centres where they can get treatment but added that even some of the big centres were coming up short for some cancers.
But the problems, he added, were not uniform with treatment rates for some cancer types much better.
RCS president Tim Mitchell echoed the concerns, saying: "The NHS has access to world-class cancer treatments and care, but inconsistent delivery means far too many patients miss out.
"At worst, this may mean some patients are needlessly dying or in unnecessary pain."
And cancer charities said tacking the failings was arguably more important than reducing waiting times.
Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said the findings were "quite staggering", adding that tackling the variation should be the "number one priority" in the forthcoming national cancer strategy.
"Getting the best care to give you the greatest chance of survival should not come down to which hospital you attend or where you live in the country," she said.
Ms Byrne said patients should get the right care for their particular type of cancer, no matter where they are.
"We are concerned that people from deprived, rural or ethnically diverse communities could be losing out in particular," she said.
Amy Rylance, from Prostate Cancer UK, said patients were effectively being denied their "best chance of a cure", adding: "This needs to change now."
NHS England cancer director Prof Peter Johnson said: "We know that patients' experience of cancer treatment does vary – and we are working hard to address this."
And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: "Patients should be able to access the cancer care they need regardless of where they live and we are committed to addressing health inequalities as we rebuild the NHS."
A new cancer strategy is expected to be published in the second half of the year, which Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said will revolutionise services.
A Welsh government spokeswoman said it was working with the NHS to "plan, deliver, recover and improve cancer services".
She said the audit highlighted areas where further work was needed.

Headline: Judge 'deeply troubled' by PMQs exchange on Gazans settling in UK
Author: Dominic Casciani, Home and legal correspondent•@BBCDomC, •

Text: The most senior judge in England and Wales has said she was "deeply troubled" by comments made by Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch over a judge's ruling in an immigration case.
Badenoch, the Tory party leader, had asked the prime minister about a decision to grant a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians, saying it was "completely wrong".
Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: "It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration".
But Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr said the remarks were "unacceptable" and conflicted with the duty of politicians to uphold the rule of law and respect the independent role of judges.
A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had "made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy."
Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an "all-time high" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work.
The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.
Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood.
Badenoch said: "A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.
"This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?"
The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.
Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws.
The family, whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an air strike, have been granted anonymity.
Their initial application had been incorrectly made using a form reserved to help Ukrainian families reunite. They eventually won permission to stay under entirely separate general human rights considerations. These allow families from any background to make a case to reunite if there are compelling reasons to do so outside of standard immigration schemes.
This detail, including the specific risks the family say they faced, was not spelled out at PMQs, with Sir Keir saying the case had been one that had been dealt with under the Conservatives.
Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: "Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The leader of the opposition is right that it is the wrong decision.
"She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework."
He went on: "It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the government who make the policy. That is the principle. The home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case."
The prime minister has not specified what the "legal loophole" is that he wants to close.
Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.
They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open "floodgates".
The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians.
Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that "both the question and the answer were unacceptable".
"It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary," she said. "Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process."
She also said MPs, "just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law". Her officials had now written to the prime minister and the lord chancellor's offices.
Responding to Baroness Carr's comments, Badenoch said "politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in Parliament" - and that such debate "doesn't compromise the independence of the judiciary".
"This is not just some legal loophole that can be closed, but requires a fundamental overhaul of our flawed human rights laws," she said in a statement on X.
A government spokesperson said: "Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules - and that is what we are doing".
"As a former chief prosecutor, the prime minister's respect for the judiciary, the role they play in our democracy and the rule of law is beyond question," the statement added.
Making a wider point about concerns over the safety of judges, Baroness Carr said it was "not acceptable for judges to be the subject of personal attacks for doing no more than their jobs".
"Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts," she told reporters. "If they get it wrong, the protection is a challenge on appeal. If the legislation is wrong, it is Parliament's prerogative to legislate."
"It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law," the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are "public servants acting independently" and that, "frankly, judges deserve better".

Text: Ferry tickets between Guernsey and Jersey will go on sale on Wednesday after discussions between both islands' governments and three ferry companies.
Guernsey's ferry provider Brittany Ferries will offer inter-island sailings on Wednesdays from the beginning of April.
DFDS, which operates Jersey's main routes, plans to operate its own weekly service and is expected to put them on sale at a later date, the States of Guernsey said.
Deputy Neil Inder, president of Economic Development, said there was "significant demand" for the services from the islands' tourism, sports and cultural sectors, which explained the "real frustration" about delays putting tickets on sale.
Both governments are in talks with Manche-Iles Express to operate additional passenger ferries, he said.
Inder said it was "very encouraging" bookings by French passengers coming to Guernsey were up 77% compared to last year.

Headline: Meghan puts new label on jams and lifestyle range
Author: Sean Coughlan, Royal correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-18T13:19:42.985Z
Text: Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has announced a new identity for her lifestyle brand, which will be called As Ever.
Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end.
On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month.
"'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'" said Meghan's post.
The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig.
She said that the new venture would be "beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday".
Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website.
The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it "limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area".
That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery.
But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title.
If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95.
The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows.
"Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam," said Meghan.
"But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."
The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March.
It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has "poured my heart into" this forthcoming product range.
Meghan divides public opinion, with strong reactions on social media from supporters and opponents. Her fans have saluted her independence and creativity, while her opponents have already labelled the brand as "whatever".
Appropriately, she signed off her own post: "As ever, Meghan."

Headline: House search after man disappeared 22 years ago

Published Date: 2025-02-18T12:49:11.166Z
Text: Police investigating the disappearance of a man more than 20 years ago are searching an address he visited on the night he vanished.
Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer, Scotland, a few months earlier.
A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found.
Northumbria Police officers are conducting searches at a property in North Shields' Coronation Street, alongside door-to-door inquiries.
The current occupant, who moved in after 2002, had been found alternative accommodation, the force said.
Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance.
Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements.
Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries.
Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne.
His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were "still in limbo" as they did not believe he fell into the river.
Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said he was determined to provide the family "with the answers they deserve".
"After a review of the information we have, we are refocusing our efforts in the Coronation Street area and an address we know he visited on the night he went missing.
"We are grateful to the current occupant of that premises for their cooperation, and that of the wider community as we conduct our enquiries.
"We are also asking anyone who lived in Coronation Street at the time to get in touch as they may have relevant information without even realising."

Headline: 'Tough on crime' policies behind prison crisis, says review
Author: Dominic Casciani, Home and Legal Correspondent•@BBCDomC, •
Published Date: 2025-02-18T10:43:09.077Z
Text: Successive governments trying to look "tough on crime" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests.
The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending.
The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were "knee-jerk" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action.
Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026.
"It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity," Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.
England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report.
Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high.
The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding.
It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%.
The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring.
The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built.
Mr Gauke said: "Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse.
"For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system."
He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, "prison is not the only form of punishment".
Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population.
In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes.
As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place.
Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people.
"Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing," it reads.
Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen "something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most".
"As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time," he added.
"We now have the highest incarceration rate in western Europe and with that comes consequences, not least the fact that prison is pretty expensive."

Headline: Kate and children show drawing skills by sharing portraits

Text: The Princess of Wales and her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, have revealed their artistic skills in four portraits of each other.
It's believed to be the first time that a drawing by Catherine of one of her children has been shown in public - with a picture of her six-year-old son, Prince Louis.
The royals drew the portraits as "a moment of connection" to "spend time looking at and focusing on one another" while being creative, a social media post from Kensington Palace added.
The pictures are a follow-up to Catherine's recent visit to the National Portrait Gallery, as part of her early years education project, Shaping Us.
The princess had joined a class of five-year-olds going around an exhibition encouraging children to portray themselves and to understand their own emotions.
The four pictures have been issued without revealing the artist and subject - but the more grown up work would appear to be Catherine's picture of a sleeping Prince Louis.
Catherine studied A-level art at school and then history of art at St Andrews university.
Prince Louis has already shown his own creativity, with the recent release of his photograph of his mother wrapped up warm on a cold winter's day.
These latest pictures, like Louis's photograph, were issued on Prince William and Catherine's social media account.
A picture of Catherine sitting in an armchair seems likely to have been drawn by 11-year-old Prince George, while another portrait of Catherine with multi-coloured hair seems to be the work of nine-year-old Princess Charlotte.
The bright red portrait by Prince Louis could be either Catherine or Charlotte.
The pictures are highlighting the exhibition launched by the princess at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which encourages children to think about their relationships and feelings.
The princess travelled to the gallery in a school minibus and helped the young visitors as they took part in art activities, intended to help them develop emotional skills.
"These skills are key throughout our lives, shaping who we are, how we manage our thoughts and emotions, how we communicate with and relate to others, and how we explore the world around us," said the message on social media, alongside the pictures.
"Drawing portraits with children can provide a moment of connection as you spend time looking at and focusing on one another, as well as being creative," the post continued.
There is a long tradition of painting among the royals, with King Charles an enthusiastic painter. He has also been the subject of numerous works, including Jonathan Yeo's portrait last year, with its striking shades of red.

Headline: UK ticket-holder claims £65m EuroMillions jackpot

Published Date: 2025-02-17T14:37:22.888Z
Text: A claim has been made by a UK ticket-holder for the Valentine's Day's £65m EuroMillions jackpot.
National Lottery operator Allwyn said the lucky ticket-holder came forward over the weekend to claim their prize of £65,341,620.50.
The operator added that Saturday's £7.4 million Lotto jackpot had also been claimed by a single ticket-holder.
Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at Allwyn, said: "It's been an astonishing weekend of millionaire-making, which promises to keep me and my team very busy."
The EuroMillions winner matched all seven numbers on Friday's draw - 04, 14, 31, 36 and 38 with Lucky Stars 03 and 10.
Fourteen UK players also netted £1 million each in Friday evening's EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker draw.
Mr Carter said on Monday that seven of those winners are still yet to claim their prize.
"We're asking everyone to check their tickets and we're very much looking forward to meeting all the lucky winners soon," he added.
Friday's ticket-holder is the second UK EuroMillions jackpot winner of 2025.
Earlier this month, one anonymous ticket-holder scooped a prize of more than £83.4m after it was left unclaimed for 13 days.
Winners must claim their prize within 180 days of the draw.
Successful players can decide whether they want to be named or remain anonymous upon claiming the prize.
The UK's biggest EuroMillions jackpot, worth £195m, was claimed by an unnamed winner in July 2022.
That same year, a then record-breaking £184m was won by Joe and Jess Thwaite from Gloucester, with a Lucky Dip ticket for the draw on 10 May.
There are nine EuroMillions prizes yet to be claimed by UK ticket-holders, according to the National Lottery's website, with the largest standing at £1m.

Headline: Union and bishops criticise small boat refugee citizenship ban
Author: Lauren Turner, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-16T18:37:42.652Z
Text: A key union has joined faith leaders and charities in warning that a policy banning refugees arriving on small boats from gaining UK citizenship could "breed division and distrust".
Fresh guidance states anyone entering the UK illegally having made the dangerous English Channel crossing - on a small boat or hiding in a vehicle, for example - will be refused citizenship.
Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, and nine Church of England bishops are among 147 signatories of a letter, seen by the BBC, to the home secretary urging her to rethink the policy.
They wrote that the government must instead focus on ensuring refugees "are welcomed and integrated into British life".
The Home Office says the government has merely strengthened rules that were already in place on who could obtain citizenship.
The letter argues that citizenship is "not just a legal status" but "a tangible fulfilment of the promise of safety, dignity, and opportunity".
"When refugees become citizens, they feel a greater sense of belonging as full members of their communities with a stable future for themselves, their children and generations to come."
Referring to a riot at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham last August, it says that part of the response to that violence "should be on creating integrated communities".
It went on: "Labelling refugees, who through no fault of their own have had to put their lives at risk on flimsy vessels, or have had to hide in the backs of lorries to reach safety on our shores, as a type of second-class individual will simply breed division and distrust.
"It risks playing into a toxic politics that pits 'us vs them' and is then manipulated by the far right to bring hate and disorder to our streets."
As well as Ms McAnea of Unison - Labour's most generous union backer in the 2024 general election campaign, donating £1.49m - other signatories include the bishops of Chelmsford, Leicester, Gloucester and Dover.
The chief executives of the Refugee Council and Refugee Action have also signed it, alongside Islamic Relief UK and other faith leaders, including rabbis from the Conference of Liberal Rabbis and Cantors.
The government's new policy means anyone applying for citizenship from 10 February, having previously entered the UK illegally will be refused regardless of how long ago they arrived.
Previously, refugees who arrived via irregular routes would have to wait 10 years before being considered for citizenship.
It has also been criticised by Labour MP Stella Creasy.
A Home Office spokesperson said: "There are longstanding rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship.
"The government is strengthening these measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused."

Headline: Islanders reflect on history of diving boards
Author: Connor Belford, BBC News, Guernsey, Georgina Barnes, BBC News, Channel Islands
Published Date: 2025-02-16T07:11:06.206Z
Text: Swimmers and divers have been sharing their memories of the historic Valette bathing pools in Guernsey.
The pools have been the subject of debate since the only remaining diving board on the site was deemed unsafe by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
Following protests, the removal of the diving platform has been delayed by four weeks to give the States time to "consider the issues".
Patsy Self said she had been using the diving board since she was around 10 or 11 years old, during the 1950s.
"I think it's a shame really, because it's part of Guernsey history and the diving boards have been there...all through our childhood," she said.
Mrs Self added: "Talking to families on Sunday morning they were quite sad to see what was left of it going."
The La Valette Bathing Pools were once famous for diving competitions, with the Guernsey Swimming Club (GSC) setting up high-diving boards at the Ladies' Pool in 1925.
But the boards started being removed in the 1970s and all that remains is one low board.
The charity Vive La Vallette, which was formed in 2019 to regenerate the facilities at the pools, said it was "disappointed" the remaining diving board had been set to be removed without further consultation.
It said the bathing pools were Victorian-era intertidal structures.
"The pools are filled by the sea twice a day at the higher tides and, as the tides drop, they provide a calm swimming area for the public to enjoy," a spokesperson said.
Margaret Jones, who is also a swimmer and a childhood friend of Mrs Self, said she was uncertain about the changes.
She said: "I don't think change is always for the best. If it is for the best, then it's a good thing.
"But I think a lot of the time it's change for change sake, and that's probably what's led to the demise.. of the diving boards.
"They're taking away something and not replacing it with an alternative... why not improve it and let people use it?" she said.
Jo Norman, who began volunteering at the GSC in 1976, said La Vallette was "a special place" for her.
She said: "I remember swimming there as a child and my children learnt to swim down there too with the Guernsey Swimming Club.
"We took part in the floodlit galas, where the community would come together to join in and watch the incredible fire dives from the high boards."
Ms Norman said memories would remain at the pools forever.
"There was always such a great atmosphere down at the pools and I believe it still remains at the heart of swimming in Guernsey," she said.
The GSC said the Vallette pools were a hotspot for its events and competitions during the 1960s and 1970s.
It added that its centenary year and 125th anniversary were held at the pools as well as the "occasional swim session" and annual polar bear swim.
Barbara Quevâtre, whose late husband Hayward was a diver at the pools, said she was worried about how young people would find the changes.
She said her husband went to the pools to practise on the diving board "every lunch hour" before most of the boards were removed in 1989.
"When they came down...he was devastated, so he didn't go down there anymore," she said.
Mrs Quevâtre added: "It changed his life altogether really."
She said her husband was "older" when he started diving - and said he was "too tall to make a neat diver."
Mrs Quevâtre said it would be "a shame" if the remaining diving board was completely removed.
"There's a community down there. It hasn't been the same since the diving stages came down."
"With the diving stages taken down as well...it's not the same, you've got your winter swimmers, your all-round swimmers...but there's not the sense of a community somehow," she added.
Mrs Quevâtre said the pools had "lost their charm" since the removal of the diving stages.
"It's very nice to have wheelchair access and all the rest of it, but for me it's lost its well, charm I suppose.
"It's lost its sort of nature. To me, it's not the same in Guernsey as it was, and various areas around the coast to me have changed sufficiently that Guernsey isn't Guernsey anymore for me."

Headline: UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, says Lammy
Author: George Sandeman, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-15T18:24:35.961Z
Text: The UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, with Europe facing an "existential question" even in the event of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, David Lammy has said.
The foreign secretary told the Munich Security Conference "Putin will not go away", and that, while it was positive 23 Nato countries were now spending at least 2% of their GDP on defence, "we all know we have to go upward".
He said the UK was "absolutely" committed to spending 2.5% and would set out a "pathway" to achieving that goal in a few months' time.
Lammy's comments come after US Vice-President JD Vance told the conference on Friday that Europe must "step up in a big way to provide for its own defence".
In his address, Vance said it was his belief the greatest threat facing Europe was not from Russia or China but "from within".
He said many European governments, including the UK's, had retreated from their values and ignored issues such as migration and free speech.
Speaking on Saturday during a panel discussion on European security, Lammy told the audience that successive US presidents had asked Nato members to increase defence spending and emphasised the importance of continued support for Ukraine.
Appearing alongside his counterparts from France, Germany and Poland, Lammy said: "There is a question for Europe. If we look at GDP combined, it's about 0.01% that we are spending on that fight for Ukraine.
"We know this is the frontline, not just for Ukraine, but for Europe. We know too that even when we get to a negotiated peace, Putin will not go away. So this is an existential question for Europe."
He said that he understood why the US was now focusing on its security interests in the Pacific, where China is a major power both economically and militarily.
"People have given the impression that the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are tied just at this moment - it was tied in the Second World War," he said, mentioning that 30,000 British soldiers died in the region during that conflict.
"We recognise that pacing threat as the United States bears down on that issue. So of course Europe has to do more."
Earlier, in an article for The Telegraph, Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey said the West had done too little in the past when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014.
They said the UK and Europe now needed to "do more together" to "share the burden" of security across the continent.
The UK had committed an additional £150m towards military aid for Ukraine as well as new sanctions on people close to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he "only responds to strength", they added.
Meeting Vance on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted "security guarantees" ahead of planned peace talks between the US and Russia.
US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Putin on Wednesday and agreed to "work together, very closely" to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. It has been nearly three years since Russia invaded.
Zelensky has proposed what he described as an "army of Europe" to secure the continent.
He told the conference on Saturday: "As we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the armed forces of Europe so that Europe's future depends only on Europeans, and decisions about Europe are made in Europe."
He added: "Europe needs a single voice, not a dozen different ones."
Asked during the panel discussion about the security guarantees being considered, Lammy said a long-term military and financial partnership might be best.
"The UK has just signed a 100-year partnership with Ukraine and I would encourage Donald Trump, and the Ukrainians, to look very carefully at a deepening partnership over the next generations," he said.
"Why? Because the best deal, and the best security guarantee, is binding US industry, business and defence capability into their future.
"That is what will make Putin sit up and pay attention and that is what is attractive to a US president who knows how to get a good deal."
Among the other possible measures mentioned by experts is the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine.
Lord Dannatt, who was head of the British Army from 2006 to 2009, estimated that around 100,000 soldiers would be needed for such a mission and that the UK might need to contribute 40,000 of them.
"We just haven't got that number available," he told the BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster.
"Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing."
Sir Richard Shirreff, Nato's former deputy supreme commander, told Radio 4's Today programme that "100,000 [troops] is probably the minimum".
Asked about calls to significantly increase defence spending, he said: "This is a defining moment for European militaries [and] European governments".

Text: A single UK ticket-holder has scooped a £65m EuroMillions jackpot by winning the draw on Valentine's Day.
The winning numbers were 04, 14, 31, 36 and 38 with Lucky Stars 03 and 10.
The successful player matched all seven numbers to win the prize of £65,341,620.50, National Lottery operator Allwyn said.
Meanwhile, 14 UK players netted £1 million each in Friday evening's EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker draw.
Winners must claim their prize within 180 days of the draw.
Successful players can decide whether they want to be named or remain anonymous upon claiming the prize.
Earlier this month, a jackpot of more than £83.4m was claimed by an anonymous UK winner after 13 days.
The National Lottery said it came in at number 23 on their list of the "most spectacular" - meaning the largest - wins of all time.
The UK's biggest EuroMillions jackpot, worth £195m, was likewise claimed by an unnamed winner in July 2022.
That same year, a then record-breaking £184m was won by Joe and Jess Thwaite from Gloucester, with a Lucky Dip ticket for the draw on 10 May.
The third-biggest win came in November 2024, when an anonymous ticket-holder claimed a £177m jackpot.
There are nine EuroMillions prizes yet to be claimed by UK ticket-holders, according to the National Lottery's website, with the largest standing at £1m.

Headline: Flights cuts 'no reflection on airport' - minister

Text: A reduction in flights between the Isle of Man and the North West of England was "no reflection on the island's airport", the infrastructure minister has said.
She said EasyJet's schedule changes were not based on how the the facility was "managed or run but was rather a "business decision" made by the firm, she said.
The airline is set to reduce flights between Ronaldsway Airport and Liverpool and Manchester between April and November following a fall in demand.
Michelle Haywood said while she was "comforted" the carrier would continue to serve the island, she "understands the frustrations" of those whose travel plans had been disrupted.
An EasyJet spokesman previously said the airline continually reviewed its schedule across its network "to align with demand".
While its flights to London Gatwick and Bristol have been unaffected, in April the airline will run up to 12 flights a week to and from Manchester, and 10 flights a week to and from Liverpool.
Haywood said there had been a "real difference" in the types of flights the airline wanted to provide, and "by adding 33 new routes from the UK into Europe they need the planes to be elsewhere".
"Some of the take-off and land journeys have been a casualty of that change, its easyJet's decision to make, its unfortunate the Isle of Man is losing out slightly," she said.
But the minister said the Strategic Air Services Policy, which was recently passed by Tynwald and maintains an open skies policy, allowed the island "freedom to negotiate with airlines to explore new route".
"Work is ongoing with the airport and the Department for Enterprise over improving routes and getting increased connections into other destinations," she added.

Text: "My love, I will eat burgers & fries and fish & chips with you forever. Thank you for you," wrote Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, in a Valentine's Day message to Prince Harry.
Apart from being an insight into what everyone really wants, even among Californian health fadsters, it was a chance to send a message to her husband, who is attending the Invictus Games in Canada.
"Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine," Meghan wrote on social media, saying she was "beyond proud" of his sports event for disabled and wounded veterans.
The Prince and Princess of Wales also put out their own social media message, with a single heart emoji and a picture of the couple holding hands and kissing.
The picture of Prince William and Catherine was particularly poignant, as a still from the video that she had issued last September alongside an announcement that she had completed her cancer treatment.
It's a slightly retro-image, with autumn colours and Enid Blyton shorts, taken in woodland in Norfolk and showing Prince William kissing Catherine.
Prince Harry and Meghan are also kissing in their picture on social media, in a black and white photo of the couple behind what could be the two dishes linking the US and the UK, with a burger and fries and fish and chips a culinary marker of their own transatlantic "special relationship".
Meghan added the tag #lovewins to her Valentine's message and signed off "As ever, M."
There's also another important part of the romantic mood, with what looks like a big glass of red wine.
Although as far as can be seen, neither of the couples had bought a bunch of garage flowers on the way home and laboured over a witty message.
Why say it with flowers when you can say it on social media, with 4.6 million followers to offer their hearts?

Headline: 'Trapped in our home' - Doorbell camera captures neighbour's abuse and threats
Author: Tarah Welsh, Housing Correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-14T18:07:28.730Z
Text: It's the early hours of the morning in March 2024 and Ben is woken by shouting and swearing. It's aimed at him, and he says it feels threatening. It's the woman who lives in the flat below.
An hour before, Ben could see and hear threats on the screen of his doorbell camera. It's been rung multiple times and he says he's barely slept.
This is the 78th incident on a meticulous log Ben has been keeping since the anti-social behaviour started about a year before.
He says he's been "abused" and "physically threatened that we would be shot, stabbed and have our knees broken if we leave the house". He says he now lives in a constant state of fear.
Ben bought the ex-council flat in Wandsworth almost three years ago and around six months later, Drina Gray moved into the flat below. He says the issues began soon after.
As well as threats, he says he and his girlfriend Emma are plagued by noise from her flat below, including the tenant's dogs barking, music, shouting and vacuuming all through the night.
He says the disruption even affected his ability to work.
"Because I was so sleep-deprived, I was getting to work quite late. I couldn't focus on my job. Ultimately due to just so much stress, so much anxiety, I lost my job."
Ben eventually got a new job but says he's been left feeling "really helpless" and says the whole experience has had a detrimental impact on his mental health.
Emma adds that she too has been left "terrified".
"We just feel trapped," she says.
Ben and Emma are not alone in experiencing anti-social behaviour. According to the latest official data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 36% of people experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour last year, up from 34% the previous year.
Ben is a leaseholder in a council-owned block and says many of his complaints to Wandsworth Council went unanswered.
He says he feels ignored, despite mentioning concerns about mental health and violent threats.
Ben and Emma have called the police to their address more than 20 times and say while local neighbourhood officers have been helpful, they feel failed by the system and "let down" by response times when they call 999.
In August, an official review panel - made up of police and public officials - found there had "not been good communication between agencies" and "none of the agencies has taken ownership of the case".
Wandsworth council has accepted it "could have acted more swiftly."
Ben has now complained to the housing ombudsman.
Over the last year, across the UK, the Housing Ombudsman has ruled that of the 809 anti-social behaviour cases he has presided over, 67% of social landlords hadn't dealt with the issue to an adequate standard.
Richard Blakeway, the Housing Ombudsman, said: "Anti-social behaviour can cause unimaginable distress to people, have a profound impact on the community, and be complex for landlords to manage."
He added that he repeatedly sees cases where "failures prolong issues and leaves residents feeling unheard and continuing to suffer".
The BBC showed some of Ben's footage to Baroness Helen Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales.
"It shows that the system isn't working, once again, to protect innocent people," she says.
Baroness Newlove's husband Garry died in hospital after being attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, in August 2007 by three youths after he went to speak to a gang he believed had been vandalising his wife's car.
She says 17 years later, agencies still don't understand the impact anti-social behaviour has on victims. She fears it will take another death for it to be taken more seriously and for it not be treated as "low-level" crime.
She says her inbox is full of complaints from victims about anti-social behaviour.
Baroness Newlove hopes new powers in the Crime and Policing Bill, being drafted this year, will improve protection for victims.
In December, Ben's neighbour, Drina Gray, pleaded guilty to charges including harassment and criminal damage and will be sentenced in March.
Ben says the anti-social behaviour has continued and Gray has been rearrested multiple times since. She returned to the flat after the first arrest but the BBC understands she is temporarily staying elsewhere as per her bail conditions.
The council says following the court case, it is now seeking possession of the property.
But Ben says he has no idea when Gray will be permanently moved.
In a statement, Wandsworth Council said it "takes criminal and anti-social behaviour very seriously, and we work with partners to both support residents and to take the appropriate action against those responsible.
"This is a complex case where housing officers have been working closely with a number of different agencies, including the Police, to resolve the matter."
A spokesperson for the Met Police said: "Any form of anti-social behaviour is taken seriously and we work in partnership with local authority colleagues to ensure that issues raised are addressed".
Addressing Ben and Emma's specific case, the spokesperson said the police were working to "ensure that the offender is brought before the courts when there is evidence to support it".
The BBC contacted Drina Gray for comment.

Text: A sports team in Guernsey said it has had to charter its own boat for inter-island matches because of uncertainty over ferry sailings.
It follows months of uncertainty over what schedules will be offered between Guernsey and Jersey by Danish firm DFDS and Brittany Ferries.
Sponsorship director of Guernsey Raiders RFC, Chris Gnapp, said they had taken the "financial risk" of chartering a boat for the rugby union team.
DFDS previously said it was still finalising its schedule and it had been delayed during a legal challenge over the tender process by rival firm Brittany Ferries. The BBC has contacted both DFDS and Brittany Ferries for comment.
Mr Gnapp added: "We have had to take the financial risk of chartering this boat over because there is simply no other way of getting our training teams over to Jersey to play rugby."
Meanwhile director of Guernsey Netball, Sally Carns, said the lack of certainty about travel had been a "logistical nightmare".
Ms Carns said: "We can't allow any supporters to travel because we booked out all the flights for that day.
"On the Sunday, we have had to charter a plane, which, again, the financial risk of not filling it sits with ourselves as a charity.
"Logistical nightmare is the phrase of the week."
She said questions were being asked and discussions were going to be had.
During the coming summer months, there is expected to be a third ferry service provided by Islands Unlimited, which has said it will offer a daily foot-passenger service.
Chad Murray, managing director, said: "From what we found, there is a strong desire to have consistent, regular travel between the islands."
Mr Murray said teams had been working on the new ferry service for about 18 months.
He said there was demand for services "that allow long day trips to each of the islands, not only for tourists and visitors, but also for island communities".
Mr Murray added the current owners of the vessel it planned to use were still operating it, so they were negotiating an "exact date" of when it would be released.
He said it would be "unreasonable" to set the booking system live until they had confirmation on the date, adding he hoped it would be live in two to three weeks.

Text: The Channel Island Dog of the Year is set to go up against the best of the best at Crufts 2025.
Mika, a three-year-old Tibetan Terrier from Guernsey, claimed the hearts of islanders at the Trinity Royal Showground in Jersey on Saturday.
Her success now means she will be placed in the open bitch class at Crufts, regarded as the "world's greatest dog show" by organisers.
Mika's shared owner Chrissy Le Moignan said the category "means she's against the big girls now, so what will be will be."
Mika has attended Crufts each year with this year's show taking place at Birmingham's NEC between 6 and 9 March.
Discussing Mika's temperament, Ms Le Moignan said: "She loves the show ring, she's an absolute dream.
"She's a monster outside the show ring but put her in the ring and she knows what to do. She's a real showman and she loves it."
Mika's title-winning performance on Saturday meant she was able to follow in the paw-steps of her half sister, who won the same title two years prior.
Discussing the win, Mika's other shared owner and vice president of Guernsey Kennel Club, Paige Le Moignan, said: "I'm absolutely ecstatic, we didn't expect it at all in any way, shape or form.
"You should never go into any competition expecting to win it but everyone is there for the same reason, everyone wants to win, and we were absolutely astounded when she won."
The Channel Island Dog of the Year award is decided over the course of 10 shows throughout the year, four in Guernsey and six in Jersey.
In order to quality for the final show, a dog must win its group.
"To get an invitation for the event is huge anyway," said Ms Le Moignan.
"There was strong competition throughout, there were comments from the Jersey chairman and the judge himself that there had been really strong competition."

Headline: 'Where's my apology from MI5?' asks victim of abusive neo-Nazi agent
Author: Daniel De Simone, BBC investigations correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-14T05:59:30.200Z
Text: The woman at the centre of a case in which MI5 has admitted giving false evidence to three courts says she wants the service to give her a public apology.
Beth was attacked with a machete by her former partner, a neo-Nazi misogynist who used his MI5 role to coercively control her.
We revealed on Wednesday that MI5 gave false evidence to three courts over its handling of the man - a paid informant known only as agent X.
MI5 has now issued an "unreserved apology" describing what happened as a "serious error" - adding it took full responsibility.
But speaking for the first time since then, Beth - not her real name - asks: "Where's my apology?"
She believes she only matters to MI5 because she is "kicking up a fuss" by taking a legal case against the service and "throwing a spotlight on the way that they behave".
"But otherwise, if I were to just go quietly away, they'd never think about me again," she told the BBC.
Beth says she would like to see X - a foreign national - to be personally "held accountable for all the crimes he committed", and for there to be a review of how he was to go unpunished and start a new life abroad.
Beth's legal case claims MI5 breached her human rights by failing to protect her from agent X.
She is pursuing a formal complaint at an independent court, called the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). Judges ruled much of the case should be held in secret after MI5 said it does not confirm agent identities - under a principle known as neither confirm nor deny (NCND) - and had not done so with X.
Secret IPT sessions would be closed to Beth and her lawyers, and therefore prevent her from knowing what MI5 says in response to her claim.
"It felt completely offensive to be told that my case would have to be held in private and that I wouldn't be privy to any of the information because that's how they operated, as if they're allowed some special licence to completely breach my human rights."
However, I revealed on Wednesday that I had been told by a senior MI5 officer that X was an agent. The disclosure happened when MI5 contacted me to try to stop a BBC story about his extremism.
The IPT was one of the three courts to which MI5 gave false evidence, including by stating it had never confirmed X's agent status to me.
MI5 first lied in 2022, when the government took me and the BBC to court in an attempt to block us reporting on agent X's wrongdoing - and succeeded in banning us from identifying him.
Beth says the false evidence "proves what MI5 are capable of".
"[It] feels like all my worst suspicions have been confirmed," she adds.
"Everything that I was told by X about them, at the time we were together, has actually been proven to be the case - that they are unscrupulous people who will stop at nothing to achieve what they want."
Beth met agent X on a dating site. But, over time, he became physically, mentally and sexually abusive.
After attacking Beth with a machete, in a case that was dropped by prosecutors after police failed to obtain the video of the attack, X left the UK while under police investigation and began work for a foreign intelligence agency.
"What concerns me so much is that, as far as we know, he is a free man," says Beth. "I don't want other women to have to put up with things like this. It's disgusting."
She believes MI5 has a particular type of power that enables it to avoid transparency like other organisations.
MI5 says it is conducting an internal investigation into the false evidence, which may result in disciplinary action. The senior MI5 corporate witness who gave false evidence says he thought he was telling the truth.
The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has also announced an independent external review of how MI5 gave false evidence. It is being conducted by Sir Jonathan Jones KC, former head of the government's legal service.
Beth's case will now head back to the specialist IPT court, which will reconsider the decision to rule that MI5 can refuse to confirm that X was an agent and therefore keep evidence secret from her.
Until this is decided, the full case will not be heard.
When I was first in contact with Beth, she had recently suffered a breakdown because of X's behaviour towards her. She has come a long way in the years since.
The legal process is re-traumatising but necessary, Beth says.
"I've already lost years of my life to X and his abuse - there seems to be no end to it.
"But it seems like it's the only way that I might, potentially, get some sort of reasonable justice."
When asked about the wider implication of her case, Beth says it is "really important".
She says there is "so much violence carried out on women by men," adding, "whatever we can do as a society against it needs to be done".
"I am one of the lucky ones because I've been able to speak about it and I've been listened to and so many don't get listened to."

Headline: UK to deny citizenship to small boat refugees
Author: Mark Easton, Home editor•@BBCMarkEaston, •
Published Date: 2025-02-13T12:20:37.991Z
Text: The government has toughened up rules making it almost impossible for a refugee who arrives in the UK on a small boat to become a British citizen.
New guidance states that anyone who enters the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey, which could be via boat, but also by means such as hiding in a vehicle, will normally be refused citizenship, regardless of the time that has passed.
In a statement, the Home Office said the strengthened measures made it clear that anyone who entered the UK illegally would face having a British citizenship application refused.
But the change has been condemned by the Refugee Council and some Labour MPs - including Stella Creasy who said the change "meant refugees would forever remain second class citizens".
Changes, first disclosed by the Free Movement blog, were introduced to guidance for visa and immigration staff on Monday.
The changes mean that anyone deemed to have entered the country illegally - including those already here - will not be able to apply for citizenship.
Described as a "clarification" to case worker guidance when assessing if a claimant is of "good character', it says: "Any person applying for citizenship from 10 February 2025, who previously entered the UK illegally will normally be refused, regardless of the time that has passed since the illegal entry took place."
Another new entry to the same guidance says: "A person who applies for citizenship from 10 February 2025 who has previously arrived without a required valid entry clearance or electronic travel authorisation, having made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship.
"A dangerous journey includes, but is not limited to, travelling by small boat or concealed in a vehicle or other conveyance."
Previously, refugees who had arrived by irregular routes would need to wait 10 years before being considered.
Under UK law, it is now an offence to enter the country without permission. This is despite the UK being signatory to international law treaties, such as the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which state that asylum seekers and refugees should not be penalised for illegal entry.
The government's new border security bill, which scraps the Conservatives' Rwanda plan and boosts police powers against people smugglers, cleared its first vote in the House of Commons on Monday.
The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists, and creates a new crime of endangering another person during an illegal crossing in the Channel.
The Home Office also published footage of enforcement teams raiding 828 premises, including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants, as part of a UK-wide crackdown on illegal working earlier this week.
Commenting on the new guidance for refugees, Labour MP Creasy said she worked with a young man who after fleeing Syria and gaining a degree is now "contributing to our society, and has now got British citizenship".
"This process would deny that," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Creasy also claimed the change to rules on citizenship for refugees would "deny" Paddington Bear from obtaining a British passport.
The fictional character famously arrived in the UK by stowing away on a boat from his home in Peru.
"Essentially it would deny, well, frankly, Paddington," Creasy said.
"Paddington did the same thing. He came by an irregular route, but we gave him sanctuary but wouldn't give him a passport."
Lord Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, urged the government to "reflect on the societal and cohesion aspects" of the policy.
He called on ministers to consider "the impact on children and their right to UK citizenship and the statelessness which would arrive for individuals if their birth country refused to renew or retain their nationality".
"Surely this Parliament should have a say in such a big change," he told the House of Lords.
In response, Home Office minister Lord Hanson of Flint said children will be "considered sympathetically under existing legislation to date".
The Home Office confirmed that the new restrictions will "likely not apply" to children, "given illegal entry is normally considered outside a child's control".
However, each citizenship application will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, it added.
The Refugee Council estimates the guidance will prevent at least 71,000 refugees from obtaining British citizenship.
Enver Solomon, CEO of the charity, said the government's move "flies in the face of reason".
"The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers.
"We know that men women and children who are refugees want to feel part of the country that has given them a home, and support to rebuild their lives.
"We urge ministers to urgently reconsider."
Meanwhile, immigration barrister Colin Yeo argued on social media that it is a "clear breach of the Refugee Convention".
Although the Conservatives have yet to respond to the government's decision, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC last week that she believes the right to citizenship and permanent residency "should only go to those who have demonstrated a real commitment to the UK".
Badenoch spoke about her proposals to toughen up citizenship rules by making it more difficult for new immigrants to be able to permanently settle in the UK.
A Home Office spokesperson said: "There are already rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship.
"This guidance further strengthens measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused."

Headline: Police catch motorists doing 90mph on 30mph roads

Text: Almost half of UK police forces have caught motorists driving more than 90mph (144km/h) on 30mph roads in the 20 months to the end of August, the RAC says.
A total of 48% of forces found drivers going more than three times the 30mph limit, while 90% had clocked people driving at 60mph.
The highest recorded speed on 30mph roads was 122mph in South Yorkshire. For 20mph roads, the top speed was logged by North Wales Police at 88mph.
The highest recorded speed on any road was 167mph on a 70mph stretch of the M1 in Leicestershire.
The largest difference between the speed recorded and the speed limit was 161mph on a 50mph in Somerset.
The data came from Freedom of Information requests the RAC made to 45 police forces relating to the period from January 2023 to the end of August 2024. Forty forces provided data.
The 10 highest speeds clocked on 30mph roads were:
RAC road safety spokesperson Rod Dennis said: "Although this data is a snapshot, it shines a light on the incredibly dangerous actions of a few, that are putting law-abiding road users at serious risk. Thankfully, the police were on hand to catch these drivers."
Chief Constable Jo Shiner, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, said choosing to drive above the speed limit amounted to "reckless, selfish and completely unacceptable" behaviour.
"We know that some incidents of going over the speed limit can be genuine mistakes or errors, but the speeds cited here are clearly drivers taking deliberate decisions to travel at excessive speeds, putting everyone at risk," she said.
A spokesman for the Department of Transport said there were tough penalties in place for drivers who speed.
"While our roads are among the safest in the world, we are committed to improving road safety, and recently relaunched our Think! campaign with a focus on speeding, particularly on rural roads."
Speed is the biggest factor reported in fatal road collisions, according to government data. In 2023 speed contributed to 888 fatalities, and more than 39,000 collisions of all severities.
More than 24,000 vehicles were caught on camera being driven at more than 100mph (161km/h) between 2019 and 2023, police data shows.

Headline: Black mould: How dangerous is it in the home and how can it be treated?
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-02-13T10:02:00.000Z
Text: Landlords for social housing in England will have to fix damp and mouldy properties more quickly from October, the government has announced.
The rules will eventually cover private landlords as well.
Campaigners called for stricter rules after two-year-old Awaab Ishak died because of mould at his Rochdale home in 2020.
Mould - sometimes referred to by the American spelling mold - is a microscopic fungus that grows in damp places.
Mould spores are found everywhere, and are released in their thousands into the atmosphere.
Signs of mould at home include fuzzy black, white or green patches on the walls, and a damp and musty smell.
People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma.
Inhaling or touching the spores that mould releases into the air can cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and a skin rash.
Mould can also trigger asthma attacks and cause coughing, wheezing and breathlessness.
The NHS in England spends an estimated £1.4bn every year treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing, according to a 2021 report from building research body BRE.
Those more at risk from mould include the elderly, children and babies, as well as people with existing respiratory illnesses and some skin problems.
Condensation is the leading cause of mould in homes across the UK.
It most commonly occurs in parts of the home where there are high moisture levels, such as bathrooms and kitchens.
When air cools, water vapour forms into water droplets as it comes into contact with cold surfaces.
These surfaces can include uninsulated external walls or windows.
If left untreated, the surface can become damp and create the conditions for mould to grow.
Older and poorly insulated properties are more prone to this.
Mould can also be caused by daily tasks which create excess moisture such as showering, cooking and drying washing indoors.
Taking shorter showers and wiping down surfaces afterwards can help, as can improving ventilation and opening windows or using an extractor fan when cooking.
It is also important to check for leaky pipes or gutters which can make the problem worse.
In December 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died after prolonged exposure to mould in his home.
He lived in a one-bedroom flat in Rochdale with his father Faisal Abdullah and Faisal's wife Aisha Amin.
Mr Abdullah reported the mould to his housing association, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), in 2017, but was told to paint over it.
Awaab was taken to Rochdale Urgent Care Centre on 19 December that year with shortness of breath, and died a few days later.
All landlords - private and social - already have a duty to keep their homes fit for human habitation. But after Awaab Ishak's death, campaigners called for stricter measures.
Awaab's law was first passed in July 2023 under the previous Conservative government, but had not taken effect by the time of the 2024 general election.
Labour has said that from October 2025, the rules will apply to social landlords - generally local councils or housing associations.
These landlords will have to address damp and mould hazards that pose a significant risk of harm to tenants, within fixed timescales.
From the same point, they will also have to address all emergency repairs - whether related to damp and mould or not - within 24 hours.
New rules setting a timeframe for dealing with non-emergency repairs such as excess cold and heat, structural collapse, fire, electrical faults and hygiene issues will take effect in 2026. More hazards will be added in 2027.
Landlords who fail to act can be taken to court and ordered to pay compensation.
The Housing charity Shelter criticised the government's decision to phase in the new legislation. It said it leaves social housing tenants at risk from poor quality accommodation.
The government's Renters' Rights Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, will extend the new rules to cover private landlords.
Ministers previously said they hoped the bill would be passed by summer 2025.

Headline: How I exposed MI5's lie about its violent abusive agent
Author: Daniel De Simone, BBC investigations correspondent

Text: Spies lie, but they are not meant to get caught.
On a wet Friday evening in December, three MI5 lawyers sat in a room at the BBC's headquarters in London. On the other side of the table were the BBC's lawyers and me. No MI5 officers were present, after we refused a request for the meeting to be secret.
After exchanging strained smiles, we got down to business - and proved to them that the Security Service had been giving false evidence to the courts.
The meeting took place after I told MI5 in November that we were planning to report it had lied and offered it a chance to comment. In response, the Security Service insisted - aggressively so - that it had been entirely honest.
What it hadn't realised until the December meeting, was that I had hard evidence to prove its position was false.
The revelation of the false evidence matters because it raises serious concerns about how reliable MI5's evidence is in the courts, where assessments from the Security Service are given enormous deference.
It also raises fresh doubts about whether MI5 can continue with a core policy of secrecy - after we revealed it was applying it selectively.
The organisation's first lie came when the government took the BBC to the High Court in 2022 to block a story about a right-wing extremist working as an MI5 agent - the term for a paid and authorised informant.
Former Attorney General Suella Braverman failed to prevent us publishing the story but succeeded in getting an order preventing the man from being identified, having argued he would be in danger. As a result, the man is known publicly only as X.
We argued he should be identified so women could be warned about such a predatory and violent man. X had used his MI5 role to coercively control his ex-partner, known publicly by the alias Beth. He was physically and sexually abusive, and was filmed threatening to kill her and then attacking her with a machete.
During the legal proceedings, MI5 said it could publicly neither confirm nor deny (NCND) whether X was an agent, in line with its long-standing policy.
In public, MI5 emphasises the fundamental role of the NCND policy, which it says it follows in relation to its agents. Any exceptions are said to undermine the secrecy that protects such men and women and to damage national security.
But then, during the proceedings, a senior MI5 officer - a deputy director of the organisation and senior counter-terrorism officer, known in court as Witness A - mentioned some phone calls involving me.
In a corporate witness statement, Witness A said an MI5 representative had spoken to me at an earlier date. This came after the Security Service became aware the BBC intended to include X in an investigative story.
Witness A said that, during the discussions, I said I had suspected X was a state agent, but that MI5 had "neither confirmed nor denied" whether this was the case.
He did not explain who initiated the discussions - it was MI5. Nor did he say how the Security Service had become aware of the planned BBC story - X had told them.
In my own detailed witness statement, I said this account did not correspond with my recollection in various respects. I did not go into further detail, because - without any waiver of legal privilege - I had been advised by lawyers it would not affect the key issues in the dispute, which centred on the claimed risks to X if he were identified by the BBC.
The BBC team also only had access to parts of the case - some evidence and hearings were in secret.
During one secret part of the proceedings, to which the BBC team and I did not have access, security-cleared lawyers appointed on our behalf were also told by MI5's lawyers that it had maintained its neither confirm nor deny policy in the calls with me.
But I knew that what Witness A said about me in his statement was untrue. I knew that MI5 had not abided by NCND. To be honest, I resented its lie.
We can also now report that MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum called the BBC director general Tim Davie, in December 2021, to cast doubt on the BBC's planned story about X.
Sir Ken's own notes of the calls, which were served as part of the government's evidence in the 2022 High Court case, record him claiming the intended story was "inaccurate as well as reckless".
However, the story was accurate. The judge found I had taken proper steps to assess whether the story's various elements were true and that it was "comfortably" shown to have a credible evidential foundation.
Despite not being allowed to identify X, the High Court ruled we could report the results of our investigation. It showed that X had abused Beth and another former partner, and that he was a dangerous extremist.
At about the same time, Beth lodged a formal complaint about her treatment by MI5 with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), an independent court with the power to investigate human rights claims against the Security Service.
It was at this court where MI5 would lie again.
The IPT often sits in secret without claimants, their legal representatives, journalists or the public present, to consider evidence deemed sensitive for national security reasons. In the case of X, this meant all the information which confirmed he was an MI5 agent.
Lawyers for the IPT are meant to represent the interests of claimants in the closed sessions. But Kate Ellis from the Centre for Women's Justice, who is representing Beth, says the system is inherently problematic.
"You're not entitled to know what's being said about you. There might be things that are being said that you could disprove. You might be being called a liar and you're not entitled to know any of this," she says.
All Beth would be able to know at the end of the case is whether she had won or lost, and she would never really understand why, Ms Ellis says.
Beth asked the tribunal that MI5 drop its policy of neither confirming nor denying. Otherwise, her lawyers argued, most of the case would have to be heard in closed sessions. They said X had already disclosed his role to Beth and used it to coerce her.
But lawyers for MI5 argued it would mean the Security Service being forced for the "first time ever" to confirm to a third party in legal proceedings whether someone was an agent.
Last summer, the IPT ruled against Beth. While it accepted that maintaining NCND had an impact on her right to a fair hearing - because she cannot counter evidence presented in secret - it said the policy "fundamentally relies upon the absolute consistency of its application".
It added that MI5 had "gone to extensive lengths throughout these and the BBC proceedings to uphold the NCND policy".
MI5 repeated its false evidence to a third court when Beth sought a judicial review of this IPT ruling.
From then, I was determined that the truth about MI5's behaviour had to come out. I had first met Beth when she was very unwell in the aftermath of X's abuse and coercion. I knew how far she had come since then and wanted to do right by her.
I began working with a small team of BBC lawyers to develop a strategy.
The truth is that, in several calls with me, a senior MI5 officer had departed from the NCND policy by announcing to me that X was an agent and inviting me to meet him. The officer said he had been legally authorised to tell me the information.
The calls were part of MI5's attempt to persuade me not to identify X as an extremist as part of our planned investigative story. They came after I had sent X a letter, detailing his involvement in violent extremism and giving him an opportunity to respond.
In November last year, after working with the BBC legal team for several months, I wrote to MI5 to say we planned to report that the Security Service had lied to the courts, and that it had departed from NCND during phone calls with me. I did not say how I would prove these claims.
At the same time, the BBC lawyers wrote to the office of the new Attorney General, Lord Hermer, to tell them we planned to apply to the court to make public the part of the MI5 witness statement in which false evidence was given.
On 25 November, a government lawyer responded on behalf of MI5 to me, saying that MI5 "stands by the entirety of the account given to the High Court in Witness A's witness statement".
It said that the Security Service's position remains that "there was no such departure" from the NCND policy and suggested that MI5's evidence had been "carefully considered".
I was surprised by this response. MI5 was gambling that I could not prove what I had set out.
It was a gamble the Security Service was about to lose.
We responded saying that MI5 was invited to a meeting where it could inspect the evidence we would rely on in our court application. We took this unusual step to allow MI5 to consider whether to consent to changing the terms of an injunction put in place at the end of the case against us in 2022.
And so it came to that meeting on 13 December, when the three lawyers acting for MI5 came to the BBC's offices at London Broadcasting House to meet me and the BBC legal team.
They read and listened to the relevant material, which comprised a handwritten note of a first call from MI5, an email I had sent to the MI5 officer following that call, and an audio recording of a second call the next day.
I took the MI5 team through the evidence in chronological order. My impression was that they appeared slightly buoyed when shown a handwritten note, deflated by the email, and defeated when faced with the 40-minute audio recording - as each step revealed our evidence was stronger.
My handwritten note showed what the purpose of MI5's call was - to tell me that X was an agent.
The MI5 officer who rang me said he had been "authorised" to tell me, something which he said would otherwise have been "illegal".
This information was volunteered to me by MI5, not in response to a query by me about whether X was an agent - which was not something I had asked either to X or to MI5.
I had never spoken to the MI5 officer before. He was not a source or a friend. In fact, as I would find, he was seeking to protect X and gave a false impression about the man's risk to women.
The officer, who worked closely with MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum, characterised X as someone who was informing on extremists for the Security Service, not an extremist himself.
The phone request was that we should not go ahead with our proposed story because MI5 said it was untrue.
My impression was that MI5 had called assuming I would agree to this request with little further challenge. Instead, during the conversation I took issue with MI5's characterisation of X, whom I regarded - and still regard - as a genuine extremist.
I also raised with MI5 the violence, abuse and coercion that X had engaged in within his personal life. I did not say how I knew about these matters, nor name anyone affected by them. Those matters had not been in my letter to X and I think the MI5 officer was surprised when I raised them.
I made clear how concerned I was about these matters. I was troubled MI5 was seeking to protect someone I regarded as a danger to women, children and the wider public.
The call concluded with me saying I would need to consider what he had requested, including in internal editorial discussions.
The MI5 officer told me he was going to make checks based on concerns I had raised about X. He asked that I send him an email summarising the information about the man's personal conduct which I had mentioned during the phone call.
The email I sent soon afterwards said: "As discussed, the male concerned was and is the subject of allegations of violence and fraud involving a British female. The alleged violence extends up to attempted murder.
"He is alleged to have engaged in domestic abuse and sexual violence, expressed paedophilic tendencies, and caused serious mental harm to people in his life."
The "attempted murder" referred to the machete incident. At that time, I had been told by Beth about the incident but had not seen the video of it. I would later obtain the video and take investigative steps to corroborate what I had been told, something MI5 could have done had it wanted to.
The next day there was a further phone call from the same MI5 officer.
I recorded the conversation for note-taking purposes, in accordance with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines, because I wanted a full record of what was said. I also did not trust MI5.
In the recorded call, the senior MI5 officer claimed the service "pretty strongly assess" that X had not been recently violent. My research would go on to prove this assessment was wholly false and the machete attack had been just the year before.
The officer said: "We do cast serious doubt on the most recent allegations of acts of violence, particularly against that individual."
He emphasised that MI5's assessment was that "we are of the belief that actually he hasn't been involved in recent acts of violence", although he qualified that by saying they could "never categorically say that was definitely the case".
During the call, he also accepted that X was not stable and had been involved in "lots of… drug gang activity" previously, "will have been involved in a bunch of things", and came "from a very shady past", implying he had been violent.
Despite all this, MI5 characterised X's relationship with Beth as "slightly problematic", suggesting she had "mental health issues".
When I wrote to X, I mentioned a vile and alarming online post he had made, about severely sexually exploiting women - using language too offensive to repeat. The MI5 officer claimed that when X had posted this, he had been temporarily de-authorised - meaning he was not at that moment working for MI5.
I explained that, based on what I knew of X, the post was what he was really like, demonstrated his propensity for violence against women, and that was the cause of my concern with him.
The officer accepted the post "strays over the line", but seemed not to understand the obvious logic that, if it had been posted when X was briefly de-authorised, this only demonstrated X's true nature even more. He was a genuinely dangerous misogynist - it was not an act put on for MI5.
The MI5 officer seemed to be most fascinated by how we had worked out X's true identity. I found this surprising, given I was talking to MI5, and explained it was basic journalism. During the call I also told the officer that X had been on a dating site under an alias used for his MI5 work.
I said that I had already been told that X was an informant, separately to MI5's call. The MI5 officer seemed concerned by this information.
However, he also invited me to meet X and learn about his work as an agent. He made this offer twice during the call. I ignored both offers.
My impression was that this was a crude attempt to offer me something exciting - a meeting with an MI5 agent - which would make me forget my concerns. I considered it wholly inappropriate given X's misogyny, sadism, paedophilic tendencies, violence and abuse.
Five days after the December meeting where we played the recording of the call to the MI5 lawyers, the government wrote to the BBC saying MI5 now took the view its evidence "may be materially incorrect, and that it is important the position is corrected as soon as possible".
The BBC decided the best way to ensure the court and government had the relevant evidence was to make our application to publish the false testimony. The application included a new witness statement from me.
We filed it on Christmas Eve.
MI5 reversed their position entirely in response.
In a new witness statement submitted to court, the MI5 deputy director Witness A said he "sincerely" apologised for giving incorrect evidence.
He said the false information "reflected my honestly held belief at that time, and which accurately reflected the information I was given".
He also said that "it is now apparent to me that MI5 did, in fact, depart from NCND during the discussions".
At this time, he has not explained how he came to give false evidence, despite the government saying two months ago that it was working "quickly" to provide an explanation.
Witness A has not identified who provided the information which he relied on.
There has also been no explanation about who was responsible for authorising the disclosure of X's status to me. Our evidence indicates various MI5 officers were aware of the discussions with me, including case officers and senior counter-terrorism staff.
In addition, the government's policy relating to planned departures from NCND says agencies should inform relevant Whitehall colleagues, including the Cabinet Office, in a "timely fashion".
This means the Cabinet Office and Home Office – as the Whitehall department responsible for MI5 – should have known in advance about the departure from NCND for agent X.
In a statement on Wednesday, the government said ministers and civil servants are not "routinely consulted on private disclosures by the agencies" and that they had not been on this occasion.
The Security Service is conducting an internal investigation and the government has launched an external review recommending changes to ensure courts are provided with accurate information in future.
But there are real concerns about how transparent the two investigations will be. And, if a review now needs to recommend how to ensure MI5 gives accurate evidence to courts, some will wonder what has been happening until now.
The question is particularly concerning since courts are required to grant particular discretion to MI5 on questions of national security.
Courts and inquiries dealing with such matters frequently sit in secret, yet deal with crucial issues of liberty, life and death - fatal attacks that were not stopped by MI5, people whose British citizenship has been stripped from them, people ordered to live under strict anti-terror powers.
MI5 has issued an "unreserved apology" to the BBC and all three courts that have been provided with false evidence. "MI5 takes full responsibility," its legal submissions state.
It said it understands the importance of ensuring that any evidence it provides is truthful, accurate and complete.
And it added: "It is acutely conscious of the particular responsibilities that MI5 bears in this regard, and that the court must be able to trust completely any evidence it provides."
These revelations come at a time of increased scrutiny of the NCND policy, following an inquiry into the British state agent known as "Stakeknife", a killer and torturer who informed on the IRA during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
Security forces and the government have refused to confirm or deny that Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci, who died last year, although the fact is well known.
Jon Boutcher, the former head of the inquiry who wrote its interim report, said NCND "seems to have assumed a totemic status" within government and the security forces and to have become "an implacable dogma or mantra with the qualities of a stone wall".
He said the policy "assumes lawful conduct on the part of the security forces", which is "generally a safe assumption", but which may need "external testing and verification".
His report recommended the government should review, codify and define the proper limits of the NCND policy in relation to identifying agents in the context of historic cases in Northern Ireland.
The government has yet to respond to the recommendation.
Beth's case already had a wider implication for MI5 in relation to how it assesses and manages agents, particularly those who pose a risk of violence to women and girls.
Now it has taken on wider implication still – about how much MI5's evidence can be taken at face value and relied on, and whether NCND needs to change.
The new evidence shows MI5 has not abided by NCND in the case of X and, in fact, wholly abandoned the policy while dismissing the agent's abusive and extremist conduct.
It shows MI5 knew what kind of person he was, and captures its dismissive attitude to concerns about his abuse and violence.
And it is due to bring to an end to Beth's judicial review case, which had been considering whether MI5 should have been allowed to maintain NCND.
MI5 itself has recommended that decision now be considered afresh by the original court, the IPT.
Beth will return to court, seeking the truth amid official secrets and lies.

Headline: MI5 lied to courts to protect violent neo-Nazi spy
Author: Daniel De Simone, BBC investigations correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-12T13:59:51.583Z
Text: MI5 lied to three courts while defending its handling of a misogynistic neo-Nazi state agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete, the BBC can reveal.
Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities.
In fact, MI5 had disclosed the man's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate the man - known publicly only as agent X.
The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls.
The BBC can reveal:
In an unprecedented admission, MI5 has now issued an "unreserved apology" to the BBC and all three courts, describing what happened as a "serious error" and saying "MI5 takes full responsibility".
There will now be pressure on MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum to explain what he knew, given that the officer said he had been legally authorised to disclose X's role.
It also raises concerns about the reliability of MI5's evidence in the courts and the sustainability of one of its core secrecy policies.
For agents "to keep protecting us, we must protect them and their identities from all those who would do them harm," said Sir Ken - in a statement released after this article was first published.
"The use of agents is difficult, human work that is governed by legislation and tightly overseen," he added.
Beth's case will now head back to the specialist court, which is investigating if the Security Service breached her human rights by failing to protect her from X's abusive and coercive behaviour.
It will reconsider whether it was right to rule that the evidence should be heard in closed sessions which she would not be able to attend.
Beth's lawyer, Kate Ellis from the Centre for Women's Justice, told the BBC: "I think this raises real concerns about MI5's transparency, about whether we can trust MI5's evidence to courts."
MI5's lie can be revealed after the BBC applied to the High Court to report false evidence in a corporate witness statement by a deputy director in the Security Service, known as Witness A.
His statement said the service had maintained its long-standing approach to neither confirm nor deny the identity of agents - a policy known by the initials NCND - and gave a false account of the MI5 officer's calls with me.
During a short hearing granting permission on Wednesday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the relevant MI5 evidence had been "false".
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has appointed Sir Jonathan Jones KC, former head of the government legal service, as an "independent external reviewer" to investigate how MI5 came to provide false evidence to the courts.
He has also been asked to recommend any changes needed to ensure that courts are provided with accurate information in future by the Security Service.
After we reported in 2022 how X terrorised his partner, Ms Cooper - then shadow home secretary - had called for an "independent assessment" of the case, looking at the way concerns about "the appalling and dangerous crime of domestic abuse" were handled by MI5.
MI5 says it is conducting an internal investigation into the false evidence which may result in disciplinary action.
Following Wednesday's hearing, we can now report that Sir Ken McCallum called the BBC's director general Tim Davie in late 2021, to cast doubt on the BBC's original planned story about agent X. Sir Ken's own notes of the calls, part of government High Court evidence from 2022, recorded him claiming my intended story was "inaccurate as well as reckless".
The BBC stood by the reporting and, after the government took us to court, a judge found I had taken proper steps to assess whether the story's various elements "were true" and that it was "comfortably" shown to have a credible evidential foundation.
Sir James Eadie KC, representing the government at court on Wednesday, said the internal MI5 disciplinary process "indicates the seriousness with which this is being taken". He said the court will be updated in April.
The significance of the disciplinary process for the individuals involved is "pretty obvious", Sir James said.
The BBC has called into question the lack of explanation from MI5. In legal submissions today, the BBC invited the court to take further steps to ensure that this "serious breach is properly investigated" and that the results of any investigation are brought into the public domain.
Exposure of MI5's false testimony will also damage its credibility in other court proceedings, where judges are obliged to give enormous weight and deference to the Security Service's evidence.
These often involve secret hearings which are closed even to those most affected - including Beth, people whose relatives have been killed in attacks and people whose UK citizenship has been stripped from them.
MI5 has acknowledged the issue, saying in legal submissions on Wednesday that it is "acutely conscious of the particular responsibilities that MI5 bears" and that courts must be able to "trust completely any evidence it provides".
The Security Service maintains that the NCND policy is essential to maintain national security and keep agents safe. But the BBC revelations will add to concerns about the way the policy is being used, including that it may stand in the way of agents being held accountable when they abuse their positions or commit crimes.
Because the senior MI5 officer told me disclosure of the agent's status had been legally authorised, it means it had been signed off by lawyers and other senior figures in MI5. The Home Office and Cabinet Office should also have been informed, according to the policy for departures from NCND.
After Wednesday's hearing, a government spokesperson said: "Ministers and civil servants are not routinely consulted on private disclosures by the agencies and were not on this occasion."
Meanwhile, in a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was "clearly a very serious matter to provide incorrect information to the court" but the government "maintains and supports the principle of neither confirming nor denying allegations about whether individuals may or may not be operating on behalf of the UK intelligence agencies".
In a new witness statement to court, the MI5 deputy director Witness A said he "sincerely" apologised for giving incorrect evidence.
He said the false information "reflected my honestly held belief at that time, and which accurately reflected the information I was given".

Headline: Vital leprosy drugs due in Nigeria after year delay
Author: Will Ross in London & Makuochi Okafor in Lagos, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-08T10:19:08.355Z
Text: People affected by leprosy in Nigeria should be able to get hold of vital drugs to treat the disease for the first time in a year from this weekend, the World Health Organization has said.
The country, which reports more than 2,000 new cases a year ran out of supplies partly because drugs were held up after new regulations were introduced.
The WHO said it had asked Nigeria to briefly lift its new testing policy and it expects the drugs to arrive from India on Sunday.
Leprosy is curable with a combination of different antibiotics, but if left untreated the patients' health can deteriorate with sores and nerve damage that cause deformities.
The treatment can last between six and 12 months.
But because of the lack of drugs in Nigeria, patients have been sent home from hospitals. As the drugs suppress transmission this increases the risk of the disease spreading.
Dr Samimu Msheliza, a public health expert and medical advisor at the Nigerian branch of the Leprosy Mission, highlighted the urgent need for medication.
"We have thousands of newly diagnosed leprosy patients across various cities who are just waiting for this drug," he told the BBC.
"The quicker we have [the drugs], the better, because currently these people are suffering, their transmission is ongoing because they are not being treated," Dr Msheliza said.
The Reuters news agency spoke to one woman at a hospital in Nasarawa state, who said her condition had got much worse since she was not able to get hold of the combination of drugs.
All Awwal Musa's fingers were clawed and her legs discharged pus. "Before last year, my wounds were getting healed but now they are getting worse. The pain is worse," Ms Musa is quoted as saying.
The nerve damage may be irreversible.
Nigeria's drug authority introduced new regulations for medicines aimed at tackling the importation of counterfeit and sub-standard drugs.
In recent years, several medicines have been recalled for failing to meet safety standards.
But the new measures have had an impact on the availability of crucial treatments, including those for leprosy.

Headline: Several dead after UN helicopter shot at in South Sudan
Author: Wedaeli Chibelushi in London & Nichola Mandil in Juba, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-07T17:33:10.345Z
Text: Several people have died in South Sudan after an attempt by the UN to evacuate members of the national army came under fire, the UN has said.
One crew member died when a UN helicopter was shot at, a statement from its mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, said. It added that an injured South Sudanese general and several other troops were also killed during the evacuation attempt in Upper Nile state.
The UN said the attack on its helicopter "may constitute a war crime".
South Sudan President Salva Kiir later said a second helicopter managed to take off after the attack, only to crash land, killing all on board. But Unmiss has said that both its aircraft landed safely in Malakal.
Twenty-seven South Sudanese soldiers were killed in total, Information Minister Michael Makuei is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying.
Weeks of fighting in Upper Nile has threatened an already fragile peace deal between President Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.
In 2013, a rift between the pair sparked a five-year civil war, during which 400,000 people were killed and 2.5 million forced from their homes.
A peace agreement was signed in 2018 but the situation has been fraught ever since.
The ongoing fighting in Upper Nile is between the armed forces and the White Army, an ethnic militia that was allied with Machar during the war.
In agreement with the White Army and South Sudan's army, Unmiss has been evacuating wounded troops from the conflict zone.
Unmiss head Nicholas Haysom said in a statement that the attack on his mission's personnel was "utterly abhorrent and may constitute a war crime under international law. We deeply regret the tragic loss of our colleague and express our sincere condolences to his loved ones.
"We also regret the killing of those that we were attempting to extract, particularly when assurances of safe passage had been received."
President Kiir said the army general who died in the attack was Gen Majur Dak, who led the forces stationed in Nasir, a region in Upper Nile.
Alongside the fighting, a slew of arrests has sparked concerns that South Sudan may see a return to war.
A number of Machar's allies, including the oil minister and a high-ranking army general, were detained earlier this week.
After Friday's attack, Kirr urged the nation to "remain calm".
"I have said time and again, that our country would not go back to war. Let no-one take the law into their own hands. The government, which I lead, will handle this crisis," he said.
South Sudan is the world's newest nation, after seceding from Sudan in 2011.

Headline: South Africa rejects 'megaphone diplomacy' with US
Author: Mayeni Jones, BBC News Africa correspondent, Johannesburg
Published Date: 2025-03-07T16:50:04.428Z
Text: The South African government has said it will not take part in "counterproductive megaphone diplomacy" following a fresh social media post by US President Donald Trump repeating his claim that Pretoria was confiscating land.
Trump extended his invitation to relocate those seeking "to flee [South Africa] for reasons of safety" to all farmers and offered them citizenship.
South Africa has previously said that Trump has misunderstood the country's new land expropriation act.
But it has already led to the US president freezing financial aid to the country.
Responding to the latest statement, the government said that South Africa was still committed to building a mutually beneficial trade, political and diplomatic relationship with the Trump administration.
A spokesperson added that the relationship between both countries should be based on mutual respect.
South Africa's new land law was signed in January, and allows land seizures without compensation in certain circumstances.
In his executive order last month that stopped aid to South Africa, Trump alleged there was discrimination against the white Afrikaner minority, descendants of Dutch and French settlers.
The US president said their land was being seized without compensation, something the South African government denies. He also offered refugee status to Afrikaner farmers, despite vowing to crack down on immigration.
On Friday, Trump said any farmer, not just Afrikaner ones, could relocate to the US.
The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.
Land ownership has been a contentious issue in South Africa with most private farmland owned by white people, 30 years after the end of the racist system of apartheid.
There have been continuous calls for the government to address land reform and deal with the past injustices of racial segregation.
The new law allows for expropriation without compensation only in circumstances where it is "just and equitable and in the public interest" to do so.
American funding to HIV programmes in South Africa was terminated last week.
The US government has also pulled out of a climate agreement that aimed to get richer countries to help a small group of developing ones, including South Africa, transition away from coal to green energy sources.

Headline: Players union welcomes life ban for Gabon football coach over sexual abuse
Author: Wedaeli Chibelushi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-06T17:22:49.193Z
Text: Fifa's decision to ban for life a former Gabonese youth coach found guilty of sexually abusing players is a "positive first step", but there are "many more perpetrators", an official at global players' union Fifpro told the BBC.
On Tuesday Fifa ruled that Patrick Assoumou Eyi, who was head coach of Gabon's national youth teams for decades, had sexually abused multiple young boys throughout his career.
Eyi was named in a 2023 BBC Africa Eye investigation into the widespread allegations of abuse plaguing Gabonese football.
In the investigation, a former Gabonese international said Eyi held the "position of a god" as he had the power to decide who would play for Gabon's youth teams.
Eyi - known widely as Capello - is "just one man that has been sanctioned" and there are "many more perpetrators" within Gabonese football, Fifpro legal counsel Loic Alves told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.
"It is a positive first step, but it is just the first step," Mr Alves said.
Eyi had admitted charges of raping, grooming and exploiting young players after allegations were first reported by the UK's Guardian newspaper in 2021.
Fifa's independent ethics committee launched its investigation into Eyi later that year.
As well as being banned for life, Eyi has been fined one million Swiss francs (£880,000; $1.1m). He is currently being held in prison.
"The investigation into Mr Eyi concerns complaints from at least four male football players who accused him of sexual abuse between 2006 and 2021. Most of these incidents occurred while the players were minors," Fifa's statement said.
One of Eyi's alleged victims, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC on Wednesday he was pleased about the ban.
"But on the other hand, I'm not satisfied because I don't want us to stop there. It's a whole network, a system that needs to be dismantled, with many predators running free," they said.
In 2023, BBC Africa spoke to more that 30 witnesses who told of a sexual abuse network that had afflicted all levels of Gabonese football for three decades.
One victim said he was abused as a teenager at an under-17 football camp. Another, who played for Gabon's national team for several years, said he was assaulted from the age of 14.
Along with the perpetrators of the abuse, governing bodies such as Fifa and Gabon's national football federation, Fegafoot, have faced accusations that they failed to protect young victims.
Both bodies denied the allegations made against them.

Headline: Nigerian senator suspended after making sexual harassment claims
Author: Mansur Abubakar, BBC News, Abuja
Published Date: 2025-03-06T16:58:30.603Z
Text: Nigerian lawmakers have suspended a senator for six months, after she submitted a petition alleging she had been sexually harassed by the senate president.
Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan first made the accusations against one of the country's top politicians, Godswill Akpabio in an interview last Friday.
After dismissing her petition on procedural grounds, the ethics committee recommended Uduaghan's suspension, saying she had brought ridicule to the upper chamber of the National Assembly.
Some senators argued that her suspension be cut to three months but a majority voted to stick with the six months suspension recommended by the ethics committee.
Women's rights activist Hadiza Ado told the BBC that Senator Uduaghan's suspension was a “sad day for Nigerian women".
Uduaghan afterwards described her suspension as "an injustice that will not be sustained".
She vowed to continue her "pursuit for justice" over her treatment.
The accusations have dominated discussions across Nigeria since she first made them nearly a week ago.
Many highly placed people and groups have called for a transparent investigation.
On Wednesday, two groups of protesters gathered at the assembly ground in the capital, Abuja - one backing Akpabio and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go.''
Mrs Ado, who founded the Women and Children Initiative, said: “We’ve been following events at the Assembly keenly and hoping that investigation into Natasha’s allegations would follow.”
“All we can say is that today is a sad day for Nigerian women fighting for emancipation. Out of 109 senators, only four are women and one is now suspended,” she said.
Many women on social media also expressed their anger over the suspension, with some calling it “oppression.”
During her suspension, Uduaghan will be barred from the National Assembly premises and her office will be locked.

Headline: Injuries as Mozambique police fire on opposition protest
Author: Jose Tembe & Basillioh Rukanga, Maputo and Nairobi
Published Date: 2025-03-06T13:19:46.777Z
Text: At least a dozen people were injured after Mozambican police violently dispersed a protest led by opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane, the runner-up in last year's disputed presidential election, Mondlane's team and a civil society group say.
Eyewitnesses and Mondlane's aides said the police fired live rounds at the opposition leader's convoy and the anti-government protesters who had joined him on the streets of the capital, Maputo, on Wednesday.
Neither the police nor the authorities have commented.
The protests came as President Daniel Chapo, who took office in January, was due to sign a deal after talks with other political parties to end months of protests over the disputed election.
Mondlane, who has been calling for the protests, was excluded from the talks leading to the ceremony.
A communique from Mondlane's office said the opposition leader had been leading a procession on Wednesday afternoon when his convoy came under fire.
"A contingent of the UIR [a rapid intervention police unit] rammed into Venâncio Mondlane's convoy and began a barrage of gunfire, using live ammunition and tear gas," it added.
In response to the incident, Interior Minister Paulo Chachine told reporters that the police had a mission to prevent any attempt to disrupt the deal-signing ceremony.
He denied that there had been an attempt to kill Mondlane.
Sixteen people were injured, according to local civil society group Plataforma Decide. The BBC has not been able to confirm the casualty figures.
Mondlane's team said two children from a nearby school had died from the shooting. It said 16 people had been injured, including their camera person, with others seriously affected by tear gas.
In a statement, it said Mondlane's condition was "unknown, and his whereabouts are causing concern among his entire team".
A video shared on social media shows the moment when gunshots started ringing out as the procession approached what looks like an armoured vehicle on the streets. People run for safety and the crowds disappear, while the gunfire continues.
More images of people bloodied from the incident have also been shared online.
A witness, who was among the protesters, told the AFP news agency that police had started shooting, as if it was an "ambush scenario. It was just a march".
"I saw some people bleeding from their wounds. My friend was wounded in the leg. I also saw a child who was shot and lost his life in hospital," AFP quoted 27-year old protester Silvestre Alexandre as saying.
Mozambique's former colonial power, Portugal, has condemned "the unacceptable attack on Venâncio Mondlane's convoy" while calling for "restraint from violence and respect for fundamental rights".
In a post on X, the Portuguese foreign affairs ministry has also offered condolences to the bereaved families.
Since President Chapo took over in January, he has made promises for a broad political dialogue that would include various sectors of the society, in order to end the country's post-election crisis.
Some analysts have however criticised him for excluding Mondlane from the talks.
On Wednesday, Mondlane condemned the political deal, calling it "an agreement of people without the people". He said that protests would continue.
"If they don't do what the people want, they won't govern Mozambique," he said.
Since October, close to 400 people have died in violence linked to the protests, according to civil society organisations.

Headline: General's arrest violates South Sudan peace deal, opposition says
Author: Nichola Mandil in Juba and Danai Nesta Kupemba in London, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-06T10:24:35.513Z
Text: The arrest of an army general from South Sudan's main opposition is a "grave violation" of the peace deal that ended a five-year civil war, an opposition spokesperson has told the BBC.
Gen Gabriel Duop Lam was arrested earlier this week, along with other senior officials of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO).
The detainees are all allies of Vice-President Riek Machar, whose rift with President Salva Kiir sparked a devastating war in 2013.
On Thursday morning, Machar's spokesperson said that the SPLM-IO did not know how their officials were or where they were being held.
"We are doing our best to avoid any escalation to the situation, however we need our partners in peace to demonstrate the political will to assure that this country will not go back to war again," Puok Both Baluang told the BBC's Newsday programme.
President Kiir has insisted that South Sudan will not return to war, government spokesperson Michael Makuei told reporters in the capital Juba on Wednesday.
Makuei added that the opposition figures were arrested because they were "in conflict with the law".
South Sudan is the world's newest nation, after seceding from Sudan in 2011. But just two years later, a civil war erupted when Kiir sacked his entire cabinet and accused Machar of instigating a failed coup.
After five years, with 400,000 lives lost, and 2.5 million people forced from their homes, a peace deal was agreed in 2018.
But it has been fraught ever since.
Gen Lam is in charge of the military wing of the opposition party, which is yet to be integrated into the army. He was taken into custody on Tuesday.
Another Machar ally, Oil Minister Puot Kang Chol, was taken by security forces in the middle of the night.
Machar's house in the capital, Juba, was surrounded by troops from the South Sudanese army overnight before they were later withdrawn.
All other senior military officials allied with Machar have been placed under house arrest, the BBC understands.
The arrests follow reports that the White Army militia had seized a strategic town in Upper Nile state close to the Ethiopian border, after clashes with government troops.
The White Army fought alongside Machar during the civil war.
Some in the army, loyal to Kiir, have accused Machar's allies of supporting the rebels.
Machar's spokesperson told the BBC that the current fighting between the White Army and security forces "would have been avoided" if the leadership of the national army had abided by the peace agreement.
The UN and African Union have warned that the violence in this area could potentially spread.
Ter Manyang, head of the Juba-based Center for Peace and Advocacy, told Reuters that the fighting in this area could threaten the peace deal.
"The country is likely to slide to war unless the situation is managed by the top leadership of the country," he said.
The country has never held an election - these are now due to take place in 2026 after years of delay.

Headline: Sexual harassment petition against Nigeria's senate president dismissed
Author: Mansur Abubakar, BBC News, Abuja
Published Date: 2025-03-06T09:18:06.606Z
Text: The petition filed by a Nigerian senator alleging sexual harassment by the senate president has been dismissed.
Godswill Akpabio, one of the country’s most senior politicians, on Wednesday denied the allegations made against him by Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan.
The ethics committee which was mandated to look at the petition cited procedural violations and legal constraints at a hearing afterwards.
"The petition runs contrary to Senate rules and cannot be entertained," said chairman of the ethics committee senator Neda Imasuen.
He added that Uduaghan had personally signed the petition instead of having it endorsed by another individual, violating an order of the senate.
In an interview with Arise Television on Friday, Senator Uduaghan alleged that Akpabio had made inappropriate advances towards her during a visit to his residence in southern Akwa Ibom state, on 8 December 2023.
She further alleged that Akpabio had, on a separate occasion, insinuated that she should "take care of him" if she wanted her motions to receive favourable consideration in the senate.
The senator alleged that Akpabio was behaving like a university lecturer who consistently failed his student who had refused to sleep with him.
But this was denied by Akpabio.
"At no time did I ever harass any woman. I was raised very well by my late single mother, and I have always upheld respect for women. I was even awarded the most gender-friendly governor in Nigeria," he noted.
The issue has generated huge debate in Nigeria with many calling for an independent investigation.
In a social media post, one of Akpabio's predecessors as senate president, Bukola Saraki, said the issues raised were too serious to be simply brushed aside.
Earlier on Wednesday, two groups of protesters gathered at the assembly ground in the capital, Abuja - one backing Akpabio and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go.''
Senator Uduaghan used Wednesday's plenary session to submit the petition calling for an investigation into Akpabio's behaviour.
As the president, it was Akpabio who allowed Uduaghan to submit the petition.
Before becoming senate president less than two years ago, Akpabio was governor of the oil-rich Akwa Ibom state for eight years and also minister of Niger Delta affairs under former President Muhammadu Buhari.

Headline: Nine things about Lesotho - the country 'nobody has ever heard of'
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-05T18:46:01.805Z
Text: US President Donald Trump has said that "nobody has ever heard of" the African country of Lesotho - a comment that has "shocked" its government.
It is a small country in southern Africa that almost entirely consists of mountains and is completely surrounded by South Africa.
Here are nine things to know about the country:
The Kingdom of Lesotho is made up mostly of highlands, where many villages can only be reached on horseback, by foot or light aircraft.
It is known as the "Kingdom in the Sky" and is the only independent state in the world that lies entirely above 1,000m (3,281ft) in elevation, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Its lowest point is at 1,400m.
It is known to have one of the world's most intimidating airstrips to land on - the Matekane Airstrip has a short runway and with long drops at both ends.
The Business Insider website describes flying from the airport as "essentially the same as when a bird is pushed out of the nest in order to learn to fly".
Lesotho is completely encircled by South Africa, but separated by the forbidding mountain ranges.
Not much of its land is available for farming, with its population vulnerable to food shortages and relying on income from jobs in South Africa. Over the decades thousands of workers have been forced by the lack of job opportunities at home to find work in South Africa.
The people of Lesotho, who number more than two million, share some cultural and language similarities with South Africans. Their language, Sesotho, is also one of South Africa's 11 official languages. In fact, more people speak it in South Africa - 4.6 million - than in Lesotho.
Resources are scarce in Lesotho - a consequence of the harsh environment of the highland plateau and limited agricultural space in the lowlands.
Its biggest resource is water - known locally as white gold - which is exported to South Africa. Diamonds are another major export.
When you think of skiing and snowboarding, you may imagine the snowy slopes of Europe and North America.
But Lesotho has been making itself known on the snowsports scene. It has the highest ski resort in sub-Saharan Africa, one of just a handful on the continent.
Afriski is situated 3,222m above sea level, high up in Lesotho's Maloti mountains and attracts visitors from Africa and beyond.
People from Lesotho are referred to as Basotho.
Some of the cultural items associated with the Basotho people are their blankets and the Basotho traditional conical hats, known as the mokorotlo. The hat is a national symbol and appears in the middle of the country's flag.
The blankets are made from thick wool, with their intricate and colourful patterns each telling a different story of the Basotho people's history. The Basotho wear them as shawls at special events and give them as gifts.
Lesotho has one of the highest rates of HIV prevalence in the world, with one in five adults living with HIV, and more infections per 100,000 people than most other countries, including neighbouring Namibia, Botswana and Eswatini.
The US government has committed nearly $1bn to help the country deal with HIV since 2006, including for prevention, care and treatment services, according to the US State Department.
Like the United Kingdom, Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. This means that although it has a royal family, an elected prime minister runs the country.
Lesotho's Prince Seeiso - the younger brother of current King Letsie III - is close friends with the UK's Prince Harry.
The pair have set up a charity in Lesotho - Sentebale, which means "forget me not". The organisation works with local communities in the country at grassroots level, helping young people affected by HIV/Aids.
Prince Harry first went to Lesotho as a 19-year-old and has returned to the country many times since then.
Jeans have long been associated with the American West but nowadays, many of the pairs worn in the US have come from halfway across the world, in Lesotho.
Lesotho's garment factories have made jeans for iconic American brands such as Levi's and Wrangler in recent years. As a result, Lesotho has become known as the "denim capital of Africa".
And it is not just jeans - Lesotho is one of sub-Saharan Africa's largest exporters of clothing in general to the US.
Last year, Lesotho exported $237m (£184m) worth of clothes and textiles to the US through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which allows eligible African countries to send some goods to the US without paying taxes.
It is ranked second by value of goods exported under the deal.
Many of Lesotho's clothing and textile factories are owned by Chinese and Taiwanese migrants.
The mountain kingdom has the world's highest suicide rate, with 87.5 people per 100,000 of the population taking their own life every year, according to the UN World Health Organization.
This is nearly 10 times the global average of nine and more than double the country with the second highest rate, Guyana, which has about 40.
There is no single reason for this shocking statistic - experts point to the abuse of drugs and alcohol, the shortage of jobs and the lack of mental health counselling.

Headline: Lesotho shocked by Trump's remarks that 'nobody has heard of the country'

Text: Lesotho's government says it is shocked by US President Donald Trump saying that "nobody has ever heard of" the southern African nation.
Trump, addressing the US Congress in his first speech since his return to the Oval Office, made the reference as he listed cuts made to what he said was wasteful expenditure.
"Eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of," Trump said, eliciting laughter from some US lawmakers.
A spokesperson for Lesotho's foreign affairs department told the BBC that Lesotho enjoyed "warm and cordial" relations with the US.
Lesotho is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the US's African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which gives favourable trade access to some countries to promote their economic growth.
According to the US government, the two countries traded goods worth $240m (£187m) in 2024, mostly exports from Lesotho to the US, in particular textiles and clothing.
Lesotho's Foreign Affairs Minister Lejone Mpotjoane said it was "shocking" to hear a head of state "refer to another sovereign state in that manner".
"To my surprise, 'the country that nobody has heard of' is the country where the US has a permanent mission," Mpotjoane told the BBC.
"Lesotho is a member of the UN and of a number of other international bodies. And the US has an embassy here and [there are] a number of US organisations we've accommodated here in Maseru."
He later told the AFP news agency: "We are not taking this matter lightly," adding that they would send an official protest letter to Washington.
Officials dismissed Trump's remarks as "off the cuff" and a "political statement", adding that they were "uncalled-for" given the good relations between the two nations.
"We maintain very warm and cordial relations with the US. They've got a mission in Maseru and we also have [one] in Washington," foreign affairs spokesperson Kutloano Pheko told the BBC.
Mr Pheko was unable to confirm Trump's comments on the funding that went to LGBTQ organisations, saying that as the money went directly to them, they would be best placed to comment.
Mpotjoane, on his part, confirmed that the country had been affected by Trump's sudden decision to pause aid funding to countries around the world.
Many organisations, mostly non-governmental, were thrown into chaos after the Trump administration announced a permanent end to the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) funding as part of a wider cost-cutting drive to reduce US government spending.
Pepfar was launched in 2003 by then US President George W Bush and its finances are distributed via the US government's main overseas aid agency USAID, whose funding has also been cut.
Lesotho is among those countries that benefited from Pepfar, its health ministry told South African publication GroundUp in February, with TB and HIV programmes among those receiving the critical funds.
But Mpotjoane declined to criticise this decision, saying it was the US's "prerogative to cut aid if they want to".

Headline: Many feared dead in Sudan after shelling hits crowded market

Text: Dozens of people in the Sudanese state of North Darfur are feared dead following heavy shelling on a camp for displaced people.
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked a crowded market at Abu Shouk, a camp on the outskirts of the city of el-Fasher, for roughly two hours on Tuesday evening, a local official told the BBC.
The camp is home to over half a million displaced people and the assault on its market is the second in three days.
El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for almost a year.
Tuesday's attack on Abu Shouk took place at the busiest time of day. The camp's population are mostly Muslims, who are observing the holy month of Ramadan, and many were out shopping at the market, preparing to break their fast for the day.
The shelling caused several injuries, ranging from mild to severe, Dr Ibrahim Nadyan, a medic at el-Fasher's last functioning hospital, told the BBC.
Abu Shouk was also shelled by the RSF on Sunday, in an attack that that killed six civilians, local health volunteers said.
The RSF has not commented on either Sunday or Tuesday's attack.
Since it erupted in April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine.
Both the RSF and the army have been accused of committing atrocities, with the RSF accused of committed a genocide in Darfur against the region's non-Arabic groups.
The conflict has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east, while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south.
In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF.

Headline: The region with more 'terror deaths' than rest of world combined
Author: Harriet Orrell, BBC World Service
Published Date: 2025-03-05T05:51:08.038Z
Text: The Sahel region of Africa is the "epicentre of global terrorism" and now, for the first time, accounts for "over half of all terrorism-related deaths", according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI).
Its new report says that in this semi-arid area to the south of the Sahara Desert 3,885 people out of a worldwide total of 7,555 died.
The GTI report adds that while the global figure has declined from a peak of 11,000 in 2015 the figure for the Sahel has increased nearly tenfold since 2019, as extremist and insurgent groups "continue to shift their focus" towards the region.
The index is published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think-tank dedicated to researching global peace and conflict.
It defines terrorism as the "threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation".
The Sahel stretches from the west coast of Africa eastwards across the continent. The GTI's definition of the region includes parts of 10 countries: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, Guinea, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria, Chad and Mauritania.
The Sahel has some of the world's highest birth rates, and almost two-thirds of the population is under 25.
Unlike in the West where "lone actor terrorism is on the rise", the Sahel, has seen the rapid expansion of militant jihadist groups, according to the report.
It says most of the attacks there were carried out by two organisations: the Islamic State group affiliate in the Sahel and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) - a branch of al-Qaeda.
"They're trying to introduce new legal orders," explains Niagalé Bagayoko, chair of the African Security Sector Network. "They're trying to administer justice in particular based on Sharia."
And in the process, she says they "are competing with one another" for land and influence.
IS-Sahel has reportedly doubled the amount of territory it controls in Mali since the country's coups of 2020 and 2021 - largely in the east near its borders with Burkina Faso and Niger - while JNIM also continued to expand its reach, according to a UN panel of experts on Mali.
The GTI report notes that both groups have recruited more fighters, including child soldiers in the case of IS.
"In some instances, people tend to be in a point of choicelessness by the time they decide to join a militant group," says Beverly Ochieng, a senior analyst specialising in Francophone Africa at Control Risks, a geopolitical risk consultancy. "These are communities that are very vulnerable."
The GTI report explains how political instability and weak governance are creating ideal conditions for insurgent groups to grow, pointing to conflict as "the primary driver of terrorism".
The Sahel is sometimes referred to as the "coup belt" of Africa.
Since 2020 there have been six successful coups in the region as defined by the GTI report: two in Mali, two in Burkina Faso, one in Guinea and one in Niger. These countries are now all run by military juntas.
"The Sahel has experienced a breakdown in state society," says Dr Folahanmi Aina, an expert on the region at SOAS University in London.
"It's been informed by years of neglect from political leaders who haven't necessarily prioritised people-centred governance and local grievances have festered, resulting in terror groups trying to leverage these."
There was a perception that civilian governments were unable to combat security threats from insurgent groups, "but despite these juntas taking over, they haven't necessarily improved optics on the ground and in fact insecurity has worsened," says Dr Aina. "The juntas are professionally unprepared for the rigours of governance."
In fact in 2024, Burkina Faso "remained the country most affected by terrorism for the second year in a row" according to the GTI.
In the 14 years since the report began, it is the only country to top the list that is not Iraq or Afghanistan.
Jihadist groups sustain their operations in the Sahel with a range of illicit economic activities, including kidnap for ransom and cattle rustling, according to the GTI report.
The region has also become a key route for drug traffickers bringing cocaine from South America to Europe, and the report notes that "drug trafficking represents one of the most financially lucrative illicit activities linked to terrorism in the Sahel".
It points out that that some groups veer away from directly engaging in organised crime, however, preferring to "make money by imposing taxes or providing security and protection in exchange for payment".
It goes on to explain: "This model not only generates revenue but also helps these groups integrate into local communities, strengthening their influence."
Insurgent groups are also vying for control of the Sahel's rich natural resources. Niger is the world's seventh-largest producer of uranium, and unregulated artisanal gold mines found throughout the region are often taken advantage of by the likes of IS-Sahel and JNIM.
Following the recent wave of coups, Sahel governments have pivoted away from Western allies, such as France and the US, towards China and Russia for support in tackling militants.
"Right now we're seeing that Russia is taking more assertive control over Russian paramilitaries in the region known as the Africa Corps [formerly Wagner]," says Ms Ochieng. "Their work is to train and support the local armies to be able to counter the insurgency in the region, but so far it hasn't been effective."
As a result, the GTI report warns that there is now a risk of overspill beyond the so-called "epicentre of terror" to neighbouring countries.
In fact, it says this may already be happening - Togo recorded 10 attacks and 52 deaths in 2024, the most since the index began. These were largely concentrated along the country's border with Burkina Faso.
Ms Ochieng agrees with this assessment, saying that "the expansion of militant groups within the region in countries like Benin or Togo or other coastal West African states seems to be imminent".

Headline: 'I risked drowning to flee conscription by Congolese rebels'

Text: Jordan Bita preferred to risk his life swimming across a roaring river than stay at home and be conscripted by rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The 25-year-old clung on to a black bin bag with some possessions as he used the strong currents to navigate his way across the Rusizi river, which forms the border between DR Congo and Burundi.
This was the last stage in a desperate journey to escape to safety in Burundi as the conflict in eastern DR Congo escalates, with M23 rebels capturing the cities of Goma and Bukavu in the last five weeks.
"I managed to flee safely… because I was crossing through the forest and moving along the bushes instead of the main road," he told the BBC after climbing up the bank on the Burundian side and wiping the water from his face.
"This is because M23 fighters are everywhere and they are forcing us to join them to fight against the government," he said.
Burundian troops are monitoring the riverbank in Cibitoke province in the north-west where Congolese families are crossing.
They are among nearly 70,000 people who have sought refuge here over the last month as the M23 rebels - backed by Rwanda, Burundi's neighbours to the north - continue to advance south in DR Congo.
At the end of January they took the major hub of Goma in DR Congo's North Kivu province and in mid-February Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, fell.
Mr Bita's luggage was thoroughly checked on the orders of Burundian troops - no weapons are allowed in.
Afterwards, he picked up his bag and carried it on his head, making his way up a steep hill to the nearest refugee camp about 12km (seven miles) away in the town of Rugombo.
He is bringing with him desperately needed food - maize meal, peanuts and beans - for his family who are already at a makeshift camp set up in the town's football stadium.
Another man, Amani Sebakungu, looked exhausted and was trying to catch his breath as he emerged from the Rusizi: "In the river you just have to take heart and say if I die or survive so be it. God willed I crossed safely."
As the BBC team was interviewing Mr Sebakungu, the Burundian military ordered us all to vacate the area as M23 rebels had been spotted marching towards the river on the other side.
Later, looking over from a nearby hill, we could see the rebels in military fatigues walking in single file and stopping the people on the Congolese side from making the crossing.
The dangers those fleeing face are real.
Over the last two weeks, at least 20 people have been swept away as they attempted to swim the 300m (984ft) across the river, which at certain points is 10m deep. It is thought many other drownings have gone unreported.
Clarice Kacindi lost her three-year-old child while crossing the Rusizi 10 days ago.
"One of my children was lying on the raft in front of me while I held three others beside me. We had many other people in the raft and when we reached the middle of the river the raft broke into two and my child was swept away," she told the BBC at Rugombo's football stadium.
"M23 are making our lives very difficult. They must stop this war. Even if I wanted to go back home, I'll be forced to start from scratch. They've stolen everything we left behind," she said.
Hundreds of white tents have been put up for shelter in the stadium as the paperwork of those seeking asylum is processed.
As many as 25 people share a tent, with many others sleeping under the stars. Food is rationed to only one meal a day.
Further south, the main border post between DR Congo and Burundi at Gatumba is also busy.
It is usually an hour's drive between the nearby Congolese city of Uvira and Burundi's main city of Bujumbura with the road humming with traders and vehicles.
Now it is only one-way traffic with refugees flowing into Burundi - mainly women and children.
Burundian security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that men were not being allowed over the border and were being told to remain in Uvira to defend the city from the M23.
Burundi has more than 10,000 troops deployed in DR Congo helping the military there fight the M23.
Many of their soldiers are now based in Uvira, which has a population of more than 300,000.
It is located on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika and is now on high alert as M23 rebels are marching south from Bukavu and are reportedly 70km away.
Burundi has been a natural ally of DR Congo over years because of its enmity with Rwanda.
Relations between Rwanda and Burundi have long been hostile, with both accusing each other of trying to overthrow their respective governments.
The countries share a similar language and ethnic make-up - with Tutsi and Hutu communities often vying for power - and both have suffered terrible ethnic-based massacres.
But unlike Rwanda, which is headed by a Tutsi president, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi.
Burundi's government fears that if the M23 cements its presence in South Kivu by taking Uvira it will strengthen a Burundian rebel group called Red Tabara.
Based in South Kivu, it is mainly made up of Tutsis - and has attacked Burundi in the past.
"It is terrible for Burundi. This is the first time in more than 20 years for the country to receive this large number of refugees," Brigitte Mukanga-Eno, an official from the UN refugee agency, told the BBC.
"We need to support this country in receiving the refugees to improve the conditions of those that are still making their way to Burundi so that there are no clashes between the refugees and host communities."
Eighty-seven-year-old Magega Mwarui can attest to the years of unrest in the region, often triggered by ethnic rivalries.
"I have fled to Burundi so many times. We cross this river carrying the little belongings we have left," the Congolese woman, who has lost her sight, told BBC in Rugombo.
"Since I was young, before I turned blind… There've been times where I almost drowned while fleeing conflict," she said.
Charlotte Odile, who is now living at a camp just outside Rugombo set up for those who have been officially registered as refugees, told us she came to Burundi with her four children after her husband was shot dead by M23 rebels in South-Kivu.
"I'm hoping to find a home for my children and peace," she said.

Headline: One-year-olds among those raped during Sudan civil war, UN says
Author: Barbara Plett Usher in Port Sudan & Natasha Booty in London, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-04T10:53:52.423Z
Text: Warning: This article contains details of sexual violence that some people may find distressing
Armed men are raping and sexually assaulting children as young as one during Sudan's civil war, says the UN children's agency, Unicef.
So traumatised are the survivors that some say they have attempted to end their lives.
Mass sexual violence has been widely documented as a weapon of war in the country's nearly two-year conflict.
But Unicef's report is the first detailed account about the impact of rape on young children in Sudan.
A third of the victims were boys, who typically face "unique challenges" in reporting such crimes and seeking the help they need.
Unicef says that, although 221 rape cases against children have been officially reported since the start of 2024, the true number is likely to be much higher.
Sudan is a socially conservative country where huge societal stigma stops survivors and their families from speaking out about rape, as does the fear of retribution from armed groups.
The Unicef report provides an appalling window into the abuse of children in the country's civil war.
Perhaps its most shocking revelation is that 16 of the victims were under the age of five years, including four infants.
Unicef does not say who is responsible, but other UN investigations have blamed the majority of rapes on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), saying RSF fighters had a pattern of using sexual violence to terrorise civilians and suppress opposition to their advances.
The RSF, which is fighting this war against its former allies, the Sudanese Armed Forces, has denied any wrongdoing.
"Children as young as one being raped by armed men should shock anyone to their core and compel immediate action," said Unicef executive director Catherine Russell.
"Millions of children in Sudan are at risk of rape and other forms of sexual violence, which is being used as a tactic of war. This is an abhorrent violation of international law and could constitute a war crime. It must stop."
According to evidence presented by international human rights groups, victims in the RSF's stronghold of Darfur were often targeted because they were black African rather than Arab, apparently with the aim of driving them out of Sudan.
The UN humanitarian response for Sudan is already underfunded. Recent cuts in US aid are expected to reduce programmes to help the victims even further.
Harrowing details in Unicef's report underscore the dire situation.
"After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her," recalls Omnia (not her real name), an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls.
"Every time they raped her, this girl would come back covered in blood. She is still just a young child. They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious. Each of them cries and speaks incoherently. During the 19 days I spent there, I reached a point where I wanted to end my life."
Unicef says the attacks included armed men storming homes and demanding that the girls be surrendered, raping some of them in front of their loved ones.
Victims were sometimes left with serious injuries and unwanted pregnancies.
In addition to the 221 rapes reported by Unicief were an additional 77 cases of sexual assault against children - mostly attempted rape.
As a fractured nation at war, Sudan is one of the most challenging places on earth to access services and frontline workers.
"The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering," said Mohamed Chande Othman, chair of the UN's fact-finding mission when its previous report was published in October.
The vast number of people displaced by the war has made women and children more vulnerable to attack – three out of four school-age girls are out of school, the UN says.
The devastating outcome of these crimes is aggravated by the fact that victims have few places to turn to for medical help, because many medical facilities have been destroyed, looted or occupied by the warring parties.
Recent US aid cuts may be endangering even the limited services available to protect children.
Unicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities.
The activists relied quite heavily on US aid, and most have been forced to shut down, according to a Sudanese coordinating committee that monitors them.
More broadly, the UN organization dedicated to protecting women's rights says local organisations led by women are vital in delivering support to survivors of sexual violence. But they receive less than 2% of the total funding of the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Fund.
The BBC learned that at least one of these local groups, known as "She Leads", was forced to close when US funding was stopped.
It was not a big expense, measured in the tens of thousands of dollars, but enabled case workers to reach around 35 survivors a month, said Sulaima Elkhalifa, a Sudanese human rights defender who runs a government unit on combatting violence against woman and helped organize the private initiative.
Those who have been raped by armed men "don't have the luxury of being depressed," she told the BBC.
The demands of war – finding food, needing to flee – leave no space to deal with trauma, she added.

Headline: Gabon junta chief declares bid for presidency
Author: Paul Njie & Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-04T07:39:59.383Z
Text: Gabon's military leader Gen Brice Oligui Nguema has announced his intention to run for president in next month's election.
Nguema seized power in 2023 in a coup that ended the long-standing rule of the Bongo family. He then pledged to hand over power to civilians.
The country has however since passed a new constitution and electoral code that critics argue were designed to favour a bid for the presidency by the junta leader.
Nguema told the Gabonese people on Monday that he had decided to run in the 12 April election "after careful reflection and in response to your many appeals".
Addressing supporters during a heavy downpour in the capital, Libreville, he declared his readiness to change the fortunes of the oil-rich country.
"I am a builder and I need your courage, your strength, to build this country," the the coup leader, who had just turned 50, said.
The announcement followed months of speculation about his intentions to officially occupy the country's top seat.
On Saturday, Nguema told the military in a meeting that he was aware of their desire to see him run in the election and urged them to vote.
He told the defence forces he had heard their calls. "I listened to you and, believe me, I understood you," adding, "I will get back to you within the next few days".
There has been speculation that Nguema had left the army, as a requirement to run for the presidency – but that has since been denied by his spokesman.
A Facebook page associated with Nguema clarified on Monday that he was required to abandon his military uniform temporarily while running for election.
The page, Infos CTRI Officiel, said that he would have to permanently leave the military if he won the election. "If he's not elected, he will return to the barracks," it said.
The Nguema-led junta is credited for ending 55 years of the Bongo dynasty.
Ali Bongo had ruled for 14 years before he was toppled. He took office after the death of his father, Omar Bongo, who had been president for 41 years.
Last month, the president of neighbouring Equatorial Guinea, Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, encouraged the Gabonese people to support Nguema for a better future for their country.
Some opposition and civil society groups in Gabon have however been urging the military leader to honour his word and leave power to civilians after the transition.
Despite Gabon's oil wealth and vast forests, one third of its 2.4 million people live below the poverty line, according to the UN.

Headline: Ghanaian MPs reintroduce controversial anti-LGBT bill
Author: Thomas Naadi, BBC News, Accra, Jake Lapham, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-04T00:09:32.171Z
Text: A group of 10 MPs in Ghana have resubmitted a controversial bill that would impose some of the toughest restrictions on LGBT rights in Africa.
The bill prescribes a three-year jail term for people who identify as gay, and five to 10 years for promoters and advocates.
The legislation was passed by parliament last year, but the former President, Nana Akufo-Addo, declined to sign it into law before leaving office in January, citing legal challenges.
It has been widely condemned by both local and international human rights groups, with some describing it as draconian.
At the dissolution of the previous parliament ahead of last December's general election, all bills that had not completed the legislative process, including receiving the president's signature, were dropped.
It is unclear whether the speaker of the new parliament will admit the bill for consideration.
Gay sex is already punishable by up to three years in prison in the conservative West African country.
President John Mahama has said he would prefer the bill to be state-sponsored, ensuring broader support and consultation.
"I do think that we should have a conversation on it again so that all of us, if we decide to move that bill forward, move it forward with a consensus," he said.
Supporters claim the legislation would help preserve what they consider to be Ghanaian culture and family values.
However rights groups have decried the legislation.
"The anti-LGBT rights bill is inconsistent with Ghana's long-standing tradition of peace, tolerance, and hospitality and flies in the face of the country's international human rights obligations," said Human Rights Watch researcher Larissa Kojoué last year.
"Such a law would not only further erode the rule of law in Ghana, but could also lead to further gratuitous violence against LGBT people and their allies."
Va-Bene Elikem Fiatsi, a Ghanaian trans woman and LGBT activist, told the Reuters news agency the bill's reintroduction was "disheartening and hard to process" but insisted LGBT activism would continue.
The bill's potential impact on Ghana's economy is a significant concern.
The country's former finance minister warned that passing the bill could result in Ghana losing up to $3.8bn (£2.9bn) in development funding from the World Bank and affecting its $3bn (£2.3bn) IMF support programme.
Opposition lawmaker John Ntim Fordjour told Reuters the country no longer needed to fear economic sanctions, citing the election of Donald Trump as US president.
"The global political climate is favourable for conservative values as demonstrated in the bold conservative pronouncements of President Donald Trump," he said.
The bill was first introduced to parliament in 2021 but has faced many delays.

Headline: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on 'terrifying' writer's block during pregnancy
Author: Grace Dean, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-03T19:06:32.508Z
Text: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says the writer's block she experienced after becoming pregnant with her first child was "terrifying".
"It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning," the acclaimed Nigerian author, 47, tells the BBC's Emma Barnett.
"I'm not sure that it was just entirely physiological but something changed, and I just could not get back into that magical place where I can write fiction."
Adichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Last year, she had twin boys, now 11 months old.
While she was pregnant, she had a "very foggy feeling" and "couldn't think as clearly," she says.
"I'm a person for whom thinking clearly is so important, and so to be in that kind of place emotionally is very frightening," she says.
Adichie is now releasing her first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count.
The book tells the story of four women navigating lives that aren't going to plan.
"I couldn't write for a while, and then I started writing again," she says.
Adichie is known for work that explores themes including feminism, gender and immigration. The novelist's 2012 Ted Talk We Should All Be Feminists helped push her to greater prominence, and was even sampled by Beyoncé on her 2013 song Flawless.
In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, she speaks about topics including parenthood, grief and artificial intelligence (AI).
Adichie's beliefs about gender have led her to reflect on how she'd like to bring up her sons. "I'm determined to raise good men," she says.
"I want to raise my boys to be emotionally comfortable, to be in touch with emotion, to not be afraid of emotion, and also to not be afraid of fear," she continues.
Compared to girls, Adichie believes boys don't have many "wholesome" role models. "This space is just occupied by noxious characters and ideas," she says.
The writer adds that she wants her sons to be "the kind of boys that never start a fight but if you bring a fight to them, they will beat you up".
As well as having her three children, since writing her last novel, Adichie has also lost both of her parents.
"Grief recedes but only in waves and then, at some point, it comes back," she says.
Adichie was surprised by how physical grief felt. "Your heart really is very heavy, you feel as though your body is somehow no longer able to carry the weight of your heart," she says.
The novelist says that grieving for her mother, who died suddenly on her father's birthday in 2021, had a role in shaping her new novel.
When she started writing the book - after her mother died - "I did not think I was writing about my mother," she says. But when she had nearly finished, she reread the manuscript and realised there was "so much about mothers and daughters" in it, even though she hadn't been conscious of this while writing.
"I felt very strongly that, in some ways, my mother had opened the door for me to get back into this magical place that means that I can write fiction," Adichie says. "I kind of thought that she's comforting me, and it was actually deeply emotional for me to make that realisation."
As someone with a deep emotional connection to the creative process, it is perhaps unsurprising that when the conversation turns to AI, Adichie has a strong stance.
The author says that we should not refer to any written content produced by generative AI produces as stories and that the technology is going to make all of us, if we embrace it widely, "increasingly stupid".
She argues that AI could limit human creativity, something she says "we should never think that we can somehow replace".
Even using AI for tasks like summarising work emails can be damaging, she says.
"The ability to summarise is something that requires a certain level of creativity and imagination and intelligence, and it just seems to me that if you're ceding that to something else, what are we going to let our brains do for us?"

Headline: Nigerian Muslims arrested for eating in public during Ramadan
Author: Mansur Abubakar, BBC News, Abuja
Published Date: 2025-03-03T13:02:05.702Z
Text: The Islamic police in the northern Nigerian state of Kano have arrested Muslims seen eating and drinking publicly, as well as those selling food at the start of Ramadan, when Muslims are supposed to fast from dawn until dusk.
The deputy commander of the Hisbah, Mujahid Aminudeen, told the BBC that 20 people had been arrested for not fasting and five for selling food, and that the operations would continue throughout the month, which began on Saturday.
"It is important to note that we don't concern ourselves with non-Muslims," he said.
Mr Aminudeen said any "disrespect" for Ramadan would not be condoned.
"It's heart-breaking that in such a holy month meant for fasting, adult Muslims would be seen eating and drinking publicly. We won't condone that and that's why we went out to make arrests," he said.
He said all 25 had been charged in a Sharia court and would be punished accordingly.
The Hisbah official added that they sometimes get tip-offs when people are seen eating.
"We do get calls from people who are enraged after seeing people eating in public and we act fast by going to the area to make arrests."
He also confirmed the arrest of other people who were seen with "inappropriate haircuts", wearing shorts above the knee and tricycle drivers mixing male and female passengers.
Last year, those arrested for not fasting were freed after promising to fast, while the relatives or guardians of some of them were summoned and ordered to monitor them to make sure they fast.
Those arrested this year were not so lucky as they will have to face the court.
Just over two decades ago, Sharia, or Islamic law, was introduced to work alongside secular law in 12 of Nigeria's northern states that have a majority Muslim population. Sharia does not apply to the Christian minorities living in the states.
Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, has a special significance in Islam.
It is during this month that Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran - Islam's holy book - were revealed to Prophet Muhammad.
Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which lay the basis for how Muslims are required to live their lives. The fast is observed during daylight hours.
Ramadan usually last 29 or 30 days, and is expected to end on Sunday 30 March.

Headline: Mother on trial over abduction of six-year-old daughter in South Africa
Author: Khanyisile Ngcobo, BBC News, Johannesburg
Published Date: 2025-03-03T10:26:15.309Z
Text: The mother of a six-year-old girl who disappeared more than a year ago in South Africa has gone on trial accused of organising her kidnapping.
Kelly Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn were arrested after Smith's daughter, Joshlin, went missing from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, in February last year.
Joshlin's disappearance sent shockwaves across South Africa and despite a highly publicised search for her, she is yet to be found.
All three have pleaded not guilty to charges of human trafficking and kidnapping.
Ms Smith initially said that Joshlin had gone missing after she left the young girl in Mr Appollis's care.
Prosecutors later accused her of having "sold, delivered or exchanged" the six-year-old and lied about her disappearance.
An intense and widespread search then ensued for the young girl but attention soon turned to Ms Smith after her friend and former co-accused, Lorentia Lombaard, turned state witness, according to South Africa's Daily Maverick news site.
Her search even attracted the interest of Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie, who offered a reward of one million rand (£42,500; $54,000) for her safe return.
The trial will run from 3-28 March at the Saldanha multi-purpose centre, which has been repurposed into a high court specifically for the case.
A judge presiding over the case earlier this year explained that the location was selected to "ensure the community has access" to proceedings throughout the marathon trial.

Headline: West African mission leaves Guinea-Bissau after 'president's threats'
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-03T08:26:21.517Z
Text: The West African regional bloc, Ecowas, says a mission deployed to Guinea-Bissau to help resolve an election dispute has left the country after the president threatened to expel it.
The team was sent in last month to help reach a "political consensus" on how to hold elections this year.
Guinea-Bissau's general elections had been scheduled for last November but President Umaro Sissoco Embalo postponed them. He has since announced 30 November this year as the new date.
The opposition has opposed the delay and said Embalo's term should have expired last week, although a Supreme Court ruling recently extended his term in office to September.
In a statement on Sunday, Ecowas said its team had met Embalo, other politicians and civil society groups to try to reach a consensus on when the elections should be held.
Ecowas said its team, together with the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (Unowas), had been deployed to the country from 21-28 February.
It said it had "prepared a draft agreement on a roadmap for elections in 2025 and had started presenting it to the stakeholders for their consent".
The team however "departed Bissau in the early morning of 1st March, following threats by [President] Umaro Sissoco Embalo to expel it", it said.
The president has not responded to the bloc's accusation.
The bloc says it will now present its report to the Ecowas president, including a proposal for an agreement leading to "inclusive and peaceful elections".
Embalo was elected for a five-year term in December 2019, and the standoff over when it should end has heightened tensions in a country that has experienced several military coups since independence in 1974.
There have been two attempts to overthrow Embalo, the latest in December 2023.
This led him to dissolve the opposition-dominated parliament.
The opposition on Thursday called for a nationwide strike, on the day they said the president's term was expiring, with the government deploying security forces across the capital.
A day earlier, Embalo visited Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Headline: DR Congo defies pressure over talks with rebel M23
Author: Anne Soy, Senior Africa correspondent, BBC News, Nairobi
Published Date: 2025-03-03T01:55:20.029Z
Text: Despite growing international pressure, the Democratic Republic of Congo is standing firm on its decision not to have direct talks with the M23 rebel group that has made major advances in the east of the country in recent months.
Last week, the UK government added to calls for the group to be part of an "inclusive dialogue" to help find a political solution to the conflict.
But in an interview with the BBC, DR Congo Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka said her government wants to negotiate with neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of backing the M23.
At least 8,500 people have been killed since fighting escalated in January, according to the Congolese authorities.
Hundreds of thousands have also been forced from their homes amid the chaos triggered by the fighting, in which UN experts and others see Rwanda as having a key role.
"The fact remains that the aggressor of the territorial integrity and of the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Congo is Rwanda," Suminwa Tuluka said, citing a UN experts' report from last year that stated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops had crossed into Congolese territory and were fighting alongside the M23.
Peace talks brokered by Angola hit a deadlock last December after Rwanda demanded that the Congolese government talk directly to the M23.
The rebel group then advanced swiftly, taking control of the cities of Goma and Bukavu in January and February.
At a joint East and Southern African mediation effort last month, regional leaders called for a ceasefire, the exit of "uninvited foreign armed forces" from Congolese territory and also urged for direct negotiations between "state and non-state parties... including M23".
Rwandan President Paul Kagame did not deny the presence of his troops in DR Congo when asked about it. "I don't know," he said in a CNN interview.
The conflict across the border has seen his country, often viewed as a darling of the West, now lose favour fast across the board.
Pressure is mounting on it to withdraw its forces from Congolese soil.
"But it has not yet effectively done so," Suminwa Tuluka said.
She welcomed US sanctions imposed on Rwandan government minister James Kabarebe, saying they would help "put pressure on the aggressors". Rwanda, however, dismissed them as "unjustified and ineffective in resolving the crisis".
The European Commission for its part has suspended "defence consultations" and placed "under review" a memorandum of understanding it signed last year with Rwanda on raw materials.
The Congolese prime minister welcomed the EU Commission's decisions, saying that "the illegal exploitation of resources - that is one of the causes of the conflict".
DR Congo accuses Rwanda of illegally exploiting its mineral deposits in the east of the country, which Rwanda denies.
Adding to the chorus against Rwanda, the UK said last week that among other measures it would pause aid except the money meant for the poorest and most vulnerable groups, unless the country withdraws its troops, engages "meaningfully" in talks and a ceasefire is achieved.
Rwanda described the decision as "punitive", saying it was unreasonable to expect it to compromise its national security.
The Congolese prime minister said that Rwanda was ignoring all the calls to withdraw its troops.
"So, who is standing in the way of [resolving the conflict]? It is not the Congolese government," she argued.
Rwanda has previously acknowledged deploying its forces "defensively and offensively" during the ongoing conflict, claiming the right to defend its territory.
It has also repeatedly accused the Congolese government of harbouring and working with the militant group the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose members include fighters from the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Asked about that, Suminwa Tuluka denied that the Congolese army works with FDLR rebels, but said her country would engage in a process of "neutralising" the militants.
When it came to what would solve the problem if direct talks with the M23 were ruled out, the prime minister said that along with negotiating with Rwanda, the answer was simple for what would guarantee a ceasefire.
"Ensure that Rwandan troops withdraw from Congolese territory and that their M23 stop killing the Congolese populations," she said.

Headline: TikTok profiting from sexual livestreams involving children, BBC told
Author: Nalini Sivathasan, Patrick Clahane & Debula Kemoli, BBC News Investigations & Africa Eye
Published Date: 2025-03-03T00:46:09.815Z
Text: TikTok is profiting from sexual livestreams performed by teens as young as 15, the BBC has been told.
We spoke to three women in Kenya who said they began this activity as teenagers. They told us they used TikTok to openly advertise and negotiate payment for more explicit content that would be sent via other messaging platforms.
TikTok bans solicitation but the company knows it takes place, moderators have told the BBC. TikTok takes a cut of about 70% from all livestream transactions, we have previously found.
TikTok told the BBC it has "zero tolerance for exploitation".
Livestreams from Kenya are popular on TikTok - each night over the course of a week, we found up to a dozen in which women performers danced suggestively, watched by hundreds of people around the world.
Warning: Contains details of a sexual nature
It's two o'clock in the morning in Nairobi, and the TikTok Lives are in full flow.
Music blasts, and users chat over each other, as a woman turns her camera on to twerk or pose provocatively. Emoji "gifts" then fill the screen.
"Inbox me for kinembe guys. Tap, tap," the performers say on repeat. "Tap, tap," is a phrase commonly used on TikTok, calling for viewers to "like" a livestream.
"Kinembe" is Swahili for "clitoris". "Inbox me" instructs the viewer to send a private message over TikTok with a more explicit bespoke request - such as to watch the performer masturbating, stripping or performing sexual activities with other women.
In some of the livestreams we watched, coded sexual slang was used to advertise sexual services.
The emoji gifts act as payment for the TikTok livestreams and - because TikTok removes any obvious sexual acts and nudity - also the more explicit content sent later on other platforms. The gifts can be converted into cash.
"It's not in TikTok's interest to clamp down on soliciting of sex - the more people give gifts on a livestream… [the] more revenue for TikTok," says a Kenyan former moderator we are calling Jo - one of more than 40,000 moderators TikTok says it employs globally.
We discovered that TikTok is still taking about a 70% cut from livestream gifts. The company denied it took such a large commission after we established the same cut in a 2022 investigation.
TikTok has long been aware of child exploitation in its livestreams - having run its own internal investigation in 2022 - but ignored the issue because it "profited significantly" from them, according to the claims of a lawsuit brought by the US state of Utah last year.
TikTok responded that the lawsuit - which is ongoing - ignored the "proactive measures" it had made to improve safety.
Kenya is a hotspot for this abuse, says the charity ChildFund Kenya, compounded by a young demographic and widespread internet usage. The African continent as a whole also has poor online moderation compared to Western countries, the charity added.
Jo, who worked for Teleperformance - contracted by TikTok to provide content moderation - says moderators are given a reference guide of banned sexual words or actions. But this guide is restrictive, says Jo, and does not take into account slang or other provocative gestures.
"You can see by the way they are posing, with the camera on their cleavage and thighs [for example], that they are soliciting sex. They may not say anything, but you can see they are signposting to their [other platform] account, but there's nothing I can do."
Another content moderator for Teleperformance, who we are calling Kelvin, says moderation is also limited by TikTok's increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), which he says is not sensitive enough to pick up on local sexual slang.
Jo and Kelvin are among seven current and former content moderators working on TikTok content who told us their concerns. Jo says about 80% of livestreams flagged in content moderators' feeds were sexual, or advertising sexual services, and TikTok is aware of the scale of the issue.
ChildFund Kenya and other charities have told the BBC that children as young as nine are taking part in these activities.
We have spoken to teenage girls and young women who say they are spending up to six or seven hours a night on the activity and making on average £30 a day - enough to pay for a week's food and transport.
"I sell myself on TikTok. I dance naked. I do that because that's where I can earn money to support myself," says a 17-year-old we are calling Esther. She lives in a poor Nairobi neighbourhood, where 3,000 residents share toilet facilities. She says the money helps her buy food for her child, and support her mother who has been struggling to pay the rent since Esther's father died.
She says she was 15 years old when she was introduced to TikTok Lives by a friend, who helped her bypass the age restrictions - only over-18s can use a Live. Users also need at least 1,000 followers to go live.
So TikTok users with a big following can act as digital pimps - hosting the livestreams selling sexual content. Some of them have back-up accounts, indicating they have been banned or suspended by TikTok in the past.
They appear to know how to evade detection by TikTok's content moderators, while generating the right amount of sexual teasing to pique customers' interest.
"When you're dancing, move away from the camera, otherwise you'll get blocked," shouts a pimp to a woman twerking on screen.
In return for being hosted, the women give pimps a cut of their earnings.
The relationship can quickly turn exploitative, says Esther. She says her digital pimp knew she was under 18, and "he likes using young girls".
He put pressure on her to earn more - meaning she needed to livestream more frequently - and took a larger cut of her earnings than she expected, she says.
"So if an emoji is sent which is 35,000ksh (£213), he takes 20,000ksh (£121) and you only get 15,000ksh (£91)."
Working for him was like being in "handcuffs" she says. "You are the one hurting because he gets the biggest share and yet it is you who has been used."
"Sophie", not her real name, who says she was also 15 when she started livestreaming on TikTok, says she got requests from men in Europe for services on third-party platforms, including from one a German user who would demand that she caress her breasts and genitals for money.
Now 18, she regrets her online sex work. Some of the videos she sent to users via other platforms were then uploaded to social media without her consent, she says.
Her neighbours found out, and warned other young people not to associate with her, she told the BBC.
"They brand me as a lost sheep, and young people are told that I'll mislead them. I am lonely most of the time."
Some of the girls and women we spoke to said they had also been paid to meet TikTok users for sex in person, or had been pressured into having sex with their pimps.
TikTok is keen to establish itself in African markets, but is not employing enough staff to effectively monitor content, the content moderators in Kenya told us.
Kenya's government has shown signs of acknowledging the issue - in 2023, President William Ruto held a meeting with TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew to call for better content moderation on the platform. The government said the company had agreed to tighter regulation, with a TikTok office in Kenya to help co-ordinate operations.
But the moderators we spoke to said, more than 18 months later, neither had happened.
Teleperformance replied that its moderators "work diligently to tag and flag user-generated content based on community standards and client guidelines" and that its clients' systems are not set up to allow Teleperformance to remove offending material or report it to law enforcement authorities.
A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC:
"TikTok has zero tolerance for exploitation. We enforce strict safety policies, including robust Live content rules, moderation in 70 languages, including Swahili, and we partner with local experts and creators, including our Sub-Saharan Africa Safety Advisory Council to continually strengthen our approach."

Headline: DR Congo accuses Rwanda of faking genocide suspects video
Author: David Mercer, BBC News, Will Ross, BBC World Service Africa editor
Published Date: 2025-03-02T16:29:42.379Z
Text: The army of the Democratic Republic of Congo has accused Rwanda of dressing up prisoners in military uniforms in an effort to pass them off as newly-captured rebels linked to the Rwandan genocide.
It comes after Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo said they had captured fighters from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) - a militia founded by ethnic Hutus who took part in the 1994 genocide against Rwanda's Tutsis.
But the DR Congo military said a video allegedly showing the handover of 20 FDLR rebels at a border crossing was "faked".
M23 fighters have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.
The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN.
In its statement, the Congolese military said the Rwandan video was a "faked incident in poor taste orchestrated with the sole aim of discrediting our army".
It said Rwanda had taken old FDLR prisoners and dressed them in new military uniforms to claim they had been newly captured in Goma.
"This is part of the Rwandan strategy to justify the invasion of parts of the DRC's territory," it added.
Rwanda has used the presence of FDLR forces in eastern DR Congo to justify its support for the M23.
The country previously denied backing the M23, but it has also stressed that due to the FDLR presence in eastern DR Congo it has a right to take military action there.
UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.
UN experts also reported last year that the Congolese military had been using several armed groups, including the FDLR, as proxies in the fight against the M23.
The genocide in Rwanda took place over 100 days in 1994.
The ethnic Hutu militia involved in killing up to 800,000 people - the vast majority from the Tutsi community - fled to what is now DR Congo, some forming the FDLR.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who headed the rebel Tutsi force that ended the killing more than three decades ago, sees this "genocidal militia" as an existential threat.
On Thursday, gunfire and explosions ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east. Videos showed chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled.
M23 rebels seized Bukavu from government forces last month following their rapid advance through the region.
The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of an alliance of rebel groups that includes the M23.
The rebels accused DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi's government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on "a foreign army" that he said was operating in the east.
The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control.

Headline: Giving away Chagos Islands not in UK's interest, says Badenoch
Author: Emma Rossiter, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-02T14:51:56.081Z
Text: Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party will not stop opposing a deal that would hand over the Chagos Islands, despite it receiving a favourable hearing from US President Donald Trump.
The proposed agreement would cede the Indian Ocean islands - which house a strategically important joint US-UK military base - to Mauritius, which has claimed sovereignty over them. The military base would then be leased back.
Badenoch told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: "It is not in our national interest to give [them] away and pay for the privilege of doing so."
A Downing Street spokesman said it welcomed that Trump had recognised "the strength of this deal".
Negotiations between the UK and Mauritius were started by the Conservatives in 2022, but an agreement to hand over the archipelago - known officially as the British Indian Ocean Territory - was announced by the Labour government in October.
It has prompted criticism since being announced, as it would see the UK lose the islands while providing Mauritius with annual payments to take them over.
There were also concerns - voiced by Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio - that handing the islands to a nation increasingly affiliated with China posed a "serious" national security threat.
The government says striking a deal was necessary to secure the future of the joint military base, known as Diego Garcia, while resolving the legal dispute over the ownership of the islands.
It also gave Trump a veto over the deal - but the US president said he was "inclined" to agree to it during a meeting with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday.
However, Badenoch has remained adamant that the Tories will not change their views about the deal.
"We will not stop our opposition to the surrender of the Chagos Islands, we will continue," she said, adding that the financial aid for Mauritius under the terms of the deal was "taxpayers' money".
"That is money which the prime minister seems to have confirmed is coming out of the defence increase that he has just announced. That's terrible," she added.
The deal has been put on hold since December while awaiting approval from the Trump administration, and after the then-newly elected prime minister of Mauritius said he had reservations about it.
Ahead of his meeting with the US president, Sir Keir came under fire from Badenoch after newspaper reports claimed that the effective price tag for carrying out the deal had jumped from £9bn to £18bn.
The government had earlier said the figures were "entirely inaccurate".
But Trump said of the deal that he had "a feeling it's going to work out very well" during the cordial White House visit.
"They're talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years actually," Trump said. "That's a long time."
Under the Chagos plan, the UK is expected to lease Diego Garcia - which is well positioned for military operations in Asia and the Middle East - for 99 years, with the option of a 40-year extension.
No specific timeframe for the deal going ahead has yet been released, but a Downing Street spokesman has said it is "progressing".
The UK will still need to work with the Mauritian government to finalise the deal and put it before Parliament for approval.

Headline: How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdom
Author: Farouk Chothia, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-02T03:04:28.631Z
Text: The love life of South Africa's Zulu king has the country agog - and has scandalised his socially conservative subjects as he messes with tradition by seeking a divorce.
Polygamy is part of Zulu culture, but King Misuzulu kaZwelithini has taken the unusual step of going to court to divorce his first wife, Queen Ntokozo kaMayisela.
"Everyone was puzzled. People were not expecting the king to go so far as to file for divorce," Prof Gugu Mazibuko, a cultural expert at South Africa's University of Johannesburg, told the BBC.
"In Zulu culture, there is no divorce. You are not supposed to chase away your wife," she said.
Regarded as the "lion of the nation", the Zulu king is the custodian of age-old traditions that place marriage and polygamy at the heart of royal success.
His role within South Africa may only be ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential, with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars.
The monarch - who grew up in neighbouring Eswatini, studied in the US and came to the throne in 2021 - seems to court controversy.
His coronation was challenged in court by his elder half-brother, who has been trying to snatch the crown from him.
His second marriage appears to be shaky, his attempt to take a third wife hit the buffers and there are also reports of another dalliance with a young princess.
However, the 50-year-old's troubled personal life used to be discussed in hushed tones - that is until he filed divorce papers in December.
Prof Mazibuko acknowledged that historical records appeared to suggest that a Zulu monarch in the 20th Century had divorced one of his queens, but it had been a "top royal secret", given royal divorce is not the norm.
"If a marriage does not work out, the wife will still live in the king's homestead. She will be given her own space. She will not have a relationship with the king, but she and her children will be well-cared for."
It was just before his accession to the throne - following the sudden death of his father and mother four years ago - that the then-Prince Misuzulu married Ntokozo Mayisela.
The two were already a couple and had two children together, but according to another cultural expert, Prof Musa Xulu of the University of Zululand, the decision to marry appeared be be hurried.
"It seems as though he felt he could not be a king without a wife," he told the BBC.
Queen kaMayisela came from an "ordinary family" - as many of the wives of Zulu kings do - in a small mining town in KwaZulu-Natal province.
It was as a cabaret singer performing at a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban that she caught the royal eye, the academic said.
Her senior status in the family was made clear at the king's state coronation in December 2022 when she sat by his side.
But her position is now under threat, with the monarch saying in court papers that they have not lived as husband and wife for at least year and their marriage has irretrievably broken down.
The palace followed this by sending out invitations for the king's wedding to a new bride, Nomzamo Myeni, set to take place in late January. The bride-price, known as lobola, had already been paid in cattle - a prized asset in Zulu culture.
Queen kaMayisela did not take any of this lying down, instituting separate court action to halt the wedding, which was postponed as a result.
Her argument was that the king - known to his subjects as "Ingonyama", meaning Lion - would be committing the offence of "bigamy" without first "converting" his civil marriage to her into a traditional Zulu marriage.
But the judge threw out her case, saying she had had a "turnaround" in attitude as she had already agreed her husband could take other wives.
He noted the monarch had already done so - marrying Nozizwe kaMulela, the MD of Eswatini Bank, in 2022.
Prof Mazibuko explained that polygamy was not initially part of Zulu culture, in fact the first two kings were bachelors.
But it was embraced by their successors - King Misuzulu is the ninth monarch of the Zulu nation - and has become part of Zulu culture.
"That's how we build families, especially the royal family," Prof Mazibuko said.
Queen kaMulela comes from an influential family in Eswatini and the marriage was apparently arranged to strengthen the ties between the royal families.
Yet it is unclear whether the pair are still in a relationship, as the high-powered banker has not been spotted at Zulu cultural events for a while - with speculation their final marriage rituals have not been completed.
The current king's various marriage problems seem to stem from the fact that tradition has not been properly followed.
In the case of the first wife, he opted for a modern-day marriage, without a traditional wedding.
"For a marriage to be perfected under Zulu custom, there has to be a public gathering, with song and dance," Prof Xulu said.
"You, as the bride, must lead with a solo song and the bride-maids dance with you, and you carry a spear which you give to the king - and then there is no going back."
This has left Queen kaMayisela without the protection of tradition - and only the offer of monthly maintenance of $1,100 (£850) for a year, though she was likely to demand more before returning to the life of a commoner, Prof Xulu said.
In the case of the second wife, the academic said lobola had been paid in January 2022, but royal insiders suggest the king felt "those who went to pay didn't have the authority to do so" - plus this union has not been marked with a public ceremony.
The fortunes of the would-be third wife, Nomzamo Myeni, remain unclear as the king failed to marry her in January despite the court giving the go-ahead.
Prof Xulu said that in Zulu culture a "postponed" marriage usually never takes place.
Though Ms Myeni is still being seen with the king, accompanying him to a state event last week where she was referred to as a queen, suggesting their wedding may take place once the king's divorce goes through.
Yet as a commoner she would bring no powerful connections with her, which may be why one of the monarch's aides recently confirmed to local media there was "a new queen-to-be" - Sihle Mdluli, who hails from the royal family of a small ethnic group in South Africa.
The aide suggested she might be named "the mother of the nation" - a title that would make her the most senior queen with her children likely heirs.
But Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if that wedding also failed to take place, as the king's relationships all seemed to run into trouble.
"I am not sure whether he was ready to be king, and whether he has good advisers," the academic said.
He pointed out that the monarch had also been behaving erratically in his public life, sacking several senior officials in his retinue.
On top of this, he has installed himself as the chairman of the board of a financially lucrative land trust, of which he is the sole trustee.
The trust was controversially established shortly before South Africa became a democracy in 1994, giving it control of about 2.8 million hectares (seven million acres) of land in KwaZulu-Natal.
King Misuzulu has also suspended all members of the board, bar one, accusing them of being uncooperative.
He did this against the advice of the government, which pointed out that as chairman he would be required to account to parliament about the trust's operations - something that would not be in keeping with his status as a constitutional monarch.
The dispute remains unresolved, giving the government a major political headache as it tries to avoid going head-to-head with the king.
Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if at some point a powerful rival faction within the royal family launched a fresh bid to dethrone him by asking the courts to rule that he is not "fit and proper" to be king.
The monarch's half-brother, Prince Simakade Zulu, who is the late king's eldest son, has long coveted the crown, but his backers were outmanoeuvred by Misuzulu's allies in succession discussions.
President Ramaphosa later gave Misuzulu a "certificate of recognition", paving the way for him to be funded by the government.
But Prince Simakade's supporters did not give up - going to the High Court to declare his state coronation "unlawful" - and won.
The court ruled that President Ramaphosa had failed to comply with the law, which required him to order an investigation into objections to Misuzulu's accession.
The status quo remains, pending the outcome of an appeal.
The scandals have the potential to weaken the king's position should it come to another tussle for the crown.
Though Prof Mazibuko noted there had always been fierce competition for the Zulu crown - except these days it takes place in court instead of a bloody battlefield.
"He is not the first king to go through a lot," she said. "I hope he survives, and everything settles down."

Headline: 'End of era' for Africa as Namibia buries founding father
Author: Damian Zane, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-01T12:14:55.560Z
Text: Namibia's founding father Sam Nujoma was "a giant among leaders" and left behind "the most precious gift of… freedom", the country's President, Nangolo Mbumba, has said.
He was speaking in front of the large crowd at Heroes' Acre, where the country's most revered citizens are buried, before Nujoma was laid to rest in a mausoleum.
The leader of Namibia's independence struggle against apartheid South Africa died last month at the age of 95.
Nujoma was seen as the last of a generation of African figures who headed anti-colonial movements and fought for freedom.
"Therefore his departure signals an end of an era, a founding father of Africa," President Mbumba said in an earlier speech at a national memorial service on Friday.
"We are not only mourning today, we are celebrating an extraordinary leader who has contributed significantly to our country's independence, who will continue to inspire us for many more years to come," Namibian Given Shiyukifein told the Reuters news agency.
On Saturday, Nujoma's coffin, draped in the Namibian flag, was driven by a military gun carriage from the centre of the capital, Windhoek, where the body was lying in state, to the burial ground on the outskirts of the city.
Mourners had been arriving since the early hours, the independent Namibian newspaper reported.
It added that they waved flags and sang songs in his memory, including Sam Ouli Peni? (Sam, Where are you?) – a popular anthem from the period after independence in 1990.
Among the dignitaries present were the presidents of neighbouring countries Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
Nujoma, one of 10 children from a peasant family, was working on the railway in the late 1940s when he got a political education. He developed a passion for politics and yearned to see his people free from the injustice and indignity of colonialism.
He led the long fight for freedom from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, and helped found the liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s.
As the country's first president – a position he held for 15 years until 2005 - Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability. His policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy.
He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock.
Namibia, then known as South West Africa, was under German occupation from 1884 until 1915, when Germany lost its colony in World War One.
It then fell under the rule of white South Africa, which extended its racist laws to the country, denying black Namibians any political rights, as well as restricting social and economic freedoms.
The introduction of sweeping apartheid legislation led to a guerrilla war of independence breaking out in 1966.

Headline: DR Congo conflict: 500 mpox patients flee clinics after rebel looting
Author: Dorcas Wangira, BBC Africa health correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-28T21:07:07.318Z
Text: More than 500 mpox patients have fled clinics in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo over the last month amid the current conflict.
Officials at Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a leading health agency on the continent, have said they are worried as the missing patients risk spreading the highly contagious disease that is suspected to have killed at least 900 people in DR Congo last year.
The patients fled from facilities in Goma and Bukavu - two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks.
"We were looted. We lost equipment. It was a disaster," Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.
Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever.
According to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.
Dr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.
His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.
At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.
Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.
The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.
They were given 72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns".
"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said.
His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.
"Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions," Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDC's mpox incident manager, said on Thursday.
Over the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory.
Dr Ngongo added that a new variant of mpox with "high potential for higher transmissibility" had also been detected in DR Congo.
The country's ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congo's army, as well as a lack of funding.
The mpox facility at Mugunga, funded by the UN children's agency (Unicef) and BrItish government aid, managed to reopen last week.
But it is already so overstretched that there are times when four or five patients have to share one bed.
"I first fled from Minova to Goma when the M23 rebels began to advance from there," Sadiki Bichichi Aristide, a 23-year-old being treated at Mugunga along with two of his children, told the BBC.
"I began to fall sick in a [camp for displaced people]. It started with my fingers, and then I had lesions, which began to rupture on my hands. My neighbours told me to go to Mugunga with my children. I left my wife behind."
He said he had seen "so many" people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week.
Dr Oummani Rouafi, Unicef's Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters.
But this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said.

Text: More than 50,000 people have fled fighting in eastern DRC into Burundi, risking their lives by swimming across the Rusizi river, using their possessions as life rafts. Over 20 have died in the last two weeks.
Those who made it claim that if they'd stayed in DRC, they would have been forced into conscription by M23 rebels - a claim the BBC has not been able to independently verify. But with the recent rapid and brutal advance of the M23, there are fears that even in neighbouring Burundi they are not safe.

Headline: Moment Bukavu was rocked by deadly explosions
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-02-27T18:24:34.915Z
Text: Explosions during a rally held by a rebel group in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have killed at least 11 people and injured around 60 others.
The blasts happened just after the M23 leaders had addressed thousands of people in Bukavu. The Rwandan backed group recently captured the city from the Congolese military. The Kinshasa government blamed a foreign army which it said was illegally present in the country - an apparent reference to Rwanda.
The M23 rebels said grenades were the same as those used by the Burundian army (which has been fighting on the Congolese government side).

Text: Gunfire and explosions have ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in a city they recently captured in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled the rally in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east, in panic.
Casualty figures are unclear, but AFP news agency has quoted a hospital source as saying that at least 11 people have been killed and 60 others are wounded.
This was the first rally that the Rwanda-backed rebels were holding in Bukavu since taking the city from government forces earlier this month following a rapid advance through the region.
The rebels accused President Felix Tshisekedi's government of orchestrating the attack.
However, Tshisekedi blamed it on "a foreign army" that he said was operating in the east.
The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of the alliance of rebel groups that includes the Rwanda-backed M23.
He promised the crowd that the rebels would bring safety and security to the city.
"There will be special units and patrols that will take place in all the communes," he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.
It is believed that Nangaa and Bertrand Bisimwa of M23 had already left when the attack took place at Bukavu's main square.
In a statement, Nangaa said that two people had been apprehended in connection with the attack, and a search was under way for other suspects.
"This cowardly and barbaric act will not go without consequences," he said.
The rebels have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.
The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN.
The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control.
Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security.
UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.

Text: The BBC is seeking a rising star of African journalism for the BBC News Komla Dumor Award, which is now in its 10th year.
Journalists from across Africa are invited to apply for the award, which aims to uncover and promote fresh talent from the continent.
The winner will spend three months at the BBC headquarters in London, gaining skills and experience.
Applications close on 20 March 2025 at 23:59 GMT.
The award honours the legacy of Komla Dumor, a distinguished Ghanaian broadcaster and former BBC World News presenter, who died suddenly aged 41 11 years ago.
Dumor's widow, Kwansema Dumor, said she was "proud" of her husband's impact at the BBC, and also said her family were "thankful to the BBC for remembering him" through the prize.
The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent.
As well as receiving training, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that they have researched, with the report broadcast to the BBC's global audiences.
Known for championing robust, dynamic journalism, Dumor made a significant impact on Africa and the rest of the world.
The BBC is committed to continuing his legacy through the award by empowering journalists from Africa to tell original and nuanced African stories to international audiences.
Rukia Bulle from Kenya was last year's winner.
During her placement, she travelled to a Senegalese village to report on the Baye Fall, an unorthodox Muslim minority who are often misunderstood by others in the wider faith.
Jonathan Munro, BBC News global director and deputy CEO, said: "We are proud to launch this year's BBC News Komla Dumor award and the search for the next recipient.
"Marking its 10th anniversary is a testament to Komla Dumor's powerful legacy of reporting on African stories with depth, insight and integrity.
"Past winners of the award reflect the exceptional talent across the continent so I look forward to welcoming this year's winner and strongly encourage journalists to apply."
Dumor was the presenter of Focus on Africa, the BBC's first-ever dedicated daily TV news programme in English for African audiences. It was broadcast on BBC World News, which has now merged with the BBC News Channel to create a single 24-hour TV news service.
He was also one of the lead presenters for BBC World News' European morning segment.
He joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of broadcast journalism in his native Ghana where he won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award.
Between 2007 and 2009 he hosted Network Africa on BBC World Service, before joining The World Today programme.
In 2009 Dumor became the first host of the African business news programme on BBC World News, Africa Business Report. He travelled across Africa, meeting Africa's top entrepreneurs and reporting on the latest business trends around the continent.
In 2013 Dumor featured in New African magazine's list of the 100 most influential Africans.

Headline: The 'hero' ship fixing Africa's internet blackouts - the BBC goes aboard
Author: Daniel Dadzie, BBC News, Accra
Published Date: 2025-02-27T00:39:31.213Z
Text: A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online.
It provides a vital service, as last year's internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged.
Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling.
It was the Léon Thévenin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years
"Because of me, countries stay connected," Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC.
"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in," he says.
"You have heroes that save lives - I'm a hero because I save communication."
His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the Léon Thévenin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment.
The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen.
Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent.
Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore.
"As long as the servers aren't in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it's accessing Facebook or any other online service," says Benjamin Smith, the Léon Thévenin's deputy chief of mission.
Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity.
"The cable generally doesn't break on its own unless you're in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks," says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship's remotely operated vehicle (ROV).
"But most of the time it's people anchoring where they shouldn't and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling."
Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic.
"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable," he says.
Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the Léon Thévenin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves.
A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship's anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.
Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia.
Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks.
Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again.
Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables.
"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there's a problem," explains Loic Wallerand, the ship's chief of mission.
There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level.
The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable.
The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged.
If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable.
But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet.
At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage.
In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is.
When the problem is with the cable's insulation - known as a "shunt fault" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost.
After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team.
Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor.
About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully.
"It doesn't sink," says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction.
The ROV's three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed.
Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship.
Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC.
Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated.
When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the Léon Thévenin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship's location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges.
"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted," Mr Wallerand says.
On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year.
"It's part of the job," says Captain Thomas Quehec.
But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices.
They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more.
Adrian Morgan, the ship's chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries.
"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them," he says.
Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son's wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission.
"I've heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn't have a mum," says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago.
"But I'm retiring in six months," he adds with a smile.
Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard.
When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship's mess hall.
Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background.
While Mr Goeieman followed his father's footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime.
"I was involved in gangs when I was younger," Mr Smith says, "My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life."
Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent.
"We are the link between Africa and the world," says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

Headline: UK suspension of aid is 'punitive', Rwanda says
Author: Wedaeli Chibelushi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-26T12:51:01.462Z
Text: The UK's decision to suspend some aid to Rwanda is "punitive", authorities in the East African country have said.
In a statement, the UK said it was against Rwanda's support for the M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising.
Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security.
More than 7,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the conflict escalated in January, DR Congo's government says.
The UK said the humanitarian situation in DR Congo was "critical" and that it would halt bilateral aid to Rwanda, "excluding support to the poorest and most vulnerable".
Earlier this month, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Rwanda receives about £32m ($40m) of bilateral aid from the UK every year.
Along with the suspension of aid, the UK will impose other measures, such as looking into potential sanctions and suspending "future defence training assistance", the statement said.
These measures will last until "significant progress" is made in ceasing hostilities and withdrawing Rwandan military personnel from DR Congo, it added.
UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.
Rwanda's foreign ministry said the "punitive measures" announced by the UK government "in response to the conflict in eastern DRC - where the UK has now clearly chosen a side - are regrettable".
"The measures do nothing to help the Democratic Republic of Congo, nor do they contribute to achieving a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern DRC."
The UK has previously enjoyed good relations with Rwanda. In 2022, the two countries signed a multi-million pound deal, in which some asylum seekers arriving on British soil would be deported to Rwanda.
The deal faced legal challenges and was scrapped last year after a change in the UK's government.
DR Congo's government has been campaigning for international powers to suspend aid and impose sanctions on Rwanda.
Last week, the US Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration, James Kabarebe.
The US accused Kabarebe, a former army chief, of being central to Rwanda's support for M23.
Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controlled in France and the UK, the US Treasury said.
Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions were "unjustified".
The M23 says it is fighting to achieve better rights for the Tutsis, an ethnic minority group in DR Congo, and to bring order to a failed state.
The rebels have captured eastern DR Congo's two biggest cities, Goma and Bukavu.

Headline: Sudan military plane crashes in residential area
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-26T11:54:00.146Z
Text: At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says.
The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians.
The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction.
The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur.
The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced.
The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash.
A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying.
Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports.
The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added.
Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle.
The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south.
In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF.

Headline: 'They took all the women here': Rape survivors recall horror of DR Congo jailbreak
Author: Orla Guerin, BBC News, Goma
Published Date: 2025-02-25T17:38:48.519Z
Text: Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start.
"He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me."
Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January.
"I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life," Pascaline tells the BBC.
He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out.
Her attackers came over the wall from the men's block right next door called "Safina", she says.
"We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped."
Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region.
Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail.
Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.
By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources.
A UN official told the BBC that "at least 153 women had perished", quoting "reliable sources in the prison".
A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands.
She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead.
She walks through the main yard of the women's section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head.
"At one point I didn't know what was happening any more," she says. "It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved."
Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft.
Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it.
"When I sleep at night, everything I've seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here."
Nadine says she was also raped by two men.
"They came with alcohol," she tells the BBC. "They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here."
The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held.
Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.
"I don't think that justice can exist in Congo," she says. "I condemn the way the government is running things."
The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east.
Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children's clothing.
Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them. Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day.
It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence.
She says "children started to die" when tear gas was fired into the women's section.
"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us," Florence says.
"When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe," she adds.
The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else.
Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces.
However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates.
"You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women's prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform."
Florence says she heard "bullets crackling" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.
"If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation."
Some of the prisoners who broke into the women's section were looking for a safer escape route, she says.
They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed. But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.
Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body.
"People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn't count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks," Florence tells the BBC.
She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.
"The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out."
The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one.
Florence says the women's prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors. They were offered no help.
"Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were," she says.
By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling.
The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison.
In a tent in the grounds of Goma's hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend.
She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine.
But her agony is more than physical.
Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison.
"I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don't know what. She died on the spot," Sifa tells the BBC.
She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was "without sin". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother's side.
How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter?
She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence.
The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out.
Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison.
"No-one will follow [this case]," Sifa says. "No-one will be pursued. It's already over."

Headline: Tinubu ex-ally criticises Nigeria reforms
Author: Mansur Abubakar, BBC News, Abuja
Published Date: 2025-02-25T17:19:28.020Z
Text: One of the architects of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu's 2023 election victory has criticised the reforms being carried out by his government.
In an interview with Arise TV, Nasir El-Rufai said the president's decision to import food to lower prices would impoverish the country's farmers.
In response, presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga said that even though El-Rufai had worked hard for Tinubu's election, it was time for him to move on from the disappointment of not being made a minister.
The 65-year-old, one of the founding members of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, was tipped to be one of Tinubu's most influential ministers before his nomination was declined by parliament.
"You don't address food inflation by destroying domestic agriculture," said El-Rufai.
"Food prices may be going down, but farmers are being impoverished because they are being made to compete with subsidised agricultural products from Europe and other countries," he said.
"I have issues with many of them [Tinubu's policies], and I'm in touch with many senior officials of the administration, and I give them my opinion privately."
The former minister also said his party had abandoned its founding values and internal democracy, warning he might leave if reforms were not made.
El-Rufai also said he had supported Tinubu in 2023 not because he was the best but because the 72-year-old was the candidate of his party.
"As a loyal party man, I was duty bound to support the party's candidate,” he noted.
He also spoke about his nomination as a minister which was later turned down by the senate over a security report.
"The idea that the National Assembly rejected me is not true. The decision was made by the president himself. Either he changed his mind, or some other factors influenced him. Regardless, I have moved on," El-Rufai said.
The politician, who has been seen with opposition figures recently, did not rule out moving to another party before the next general elections in 2027.

Headline: Claims of white genocide 'not real', South African court rules
Author: Khanyisile Ngcobo, BBC News, Johannesburg
Published Date: 2025-02-25T16:59:07.600Z
Text: A South African court has dismissed claims of a white genocide in the country as "clearly imagined" and "not real", undermining comments made by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk.
The ruling came as the court blocked a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen.
Grantland Michael Bray wanted to bequeath $2.1m ( £1.7m) to the group to help it "further its messages of racial hatred and separation".
But the court ruled this request was invalid, vague and "contrary to public policy".
Trump has referred to the "large-scale killing of farmers" in South Africa, while Musk has condemned what he said were "racist ownership laws" and previously condemned the "genocide of white people".
Despite vowing to crack down on immigration, Trump has said that white South African farmers would be allowed to settle in the US as refugees because of the persecution he said they faced.
Musk was born and grew up in South Africa before moving to the US.
The court action was brought by Mr Gray's four siblings, who are also trustees and beneficiaries of the family trust.
In it, they claimed that their brother had become "obsessed with the idea of an impending genocide of white people in South Africa" in the last 10 years of his life.
He died in March 2022.
Mr Gray, who was paralysed following an accident aged 26 while doing military service, had also become paranoid, believing the supposed "genocide" would occur soon.
"That idea was further fuelled by his already present racism and the online content that he was exposed to," Judge Rosheni Allie summarised in a 15 February ruling that has just come to light.
Mr Gray first met members of the Boerelegioen in 2020 and allegedly gave them about $326,000 (£258,000) in gold coins to help fund their cause and gain membership of the racist group.
The Boerelegioen describes itself as a "civil defence movement that enables citizens to resist the promised slaughter of whites in RSA [Republic of South Africa] as well as the theft of their property".
Mr Gray subsequently made the organisation a beneficiary to his estate, specifying that a portion of the money go towards the various training programmes the group ran.
But because there were three entities all bearing the Boerelegioen name, the court found that Mr Gray's bequest made was "vague concerning which entity was the intended beneficiary" of his will.
"The only expression of the [Mr Gray's] intention that is evident is the intention for the funds to be used for 'training' as well as [his] own assertions that he wanted the funds used to benefit an organisation which he deemed to be one which will exterminate every black person in South Africa and will be used to defend or ward off a white genocide, which is clearly imagined and not real," Judge Allie said.
On the public policy issue, Mr Gray's siblings contended that Boerelegioen wanted to use the funds to "further... its messages of racial hatred and separation".
Boerelegioen says it simply provides security and training services to communities and does not exclude anyone on the basis of race, gender or religion.
Judge Allie ruled in favour of the siblings and ordered Boerelegioen to pay the costs in the court case.
Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order freezing financial aid to the country over a new law allowing for land seizures by the South African government under certain circumstances.
The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.
But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.
South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024.
Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.
In contrast, 961 women were murdered alongside 273 children.

Headline: Uganda probes death of Nigerian footballer in shopping mall
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-25T16:23:51.476Z
Text: Police in Uganda are investigating the death of a Nigerian professional footballer who allegedly fell from a shopping mall in the capital, Kampala.
Abubakar Lawal, 29, reportedly fell from a third-floor balcony at the Voicemall Shopping Arcade, where he had gone to visit a Tanzanian friend. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead, the police said.
They said Lawal's friend, identified as Omary Naima, had left him in her room - which is part of the mall building - preparing tea before the incident happened.
Lawal was a striker playing for local team Vipers Sports Club, which has expressed its sadness for the "untimely passing of our beloved player".
Tributes have been flowing in for the Nigerian forward, fondly known as "Man from Sokoto".
He has been with Vipers since July 2022 after a two-year stint with AS Kigali in Rwanda.
In 2023, he helped Vipers win the league and cup double. In a post on X, the club said: "Lawal (Man from Sokoto) was a unique person".
"He had a big heart of gold. He really cared about people and went out of his way to help. He was incredibly generous."
His former team in Nigeria, Nasarawa United, said: "We mourn the sudden demise of our ex-player Abubakar Lawal earlier today. May God grant him eternal rest."
Ugandan footballer Mustafa Kizza said he would be forever missed: "It's hard to take in that you're no more Lawal A kind, talented, jolly, and loving person you have been."
Local media say the matter has left more questions than answers amid conflicting reports over the circumstances of Lawal's death.
Some media initially reported that he had died in a motorcycle accident.
As a result of such "contrary information", Nigeria's authorities should probe the incident, Nigerian international Ahmed Musa said on social media.
He added: "Lawal's soul deserves a thorough investigation and justice must be served if anyone is found guilty."
Police in Uganda said they were already investigating the exact circumstances of the death.
"Authorities are retrieving CCTV footage and conducting thorough interrogations to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident," police said.
The police have retrieved some items belonging to the deceased player, including two smartphones, shoes, headsets and a training kit.
"Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses," the police added.

Headline: Regrets, executions and coups: Four takeaways from former Nigerian military ruler's book
Author: Mansur Abubakar, BBC News, Abuja
Published Date: 2025-02-25T15:41:09.260Z
Text: Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993.
A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend.
Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time.
Here are four takeaways from the book:
This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.
In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.
The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.
The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.
Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.
Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote.
However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.
"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret," Babangida writes.
At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country’s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.
Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later.
Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.
Abiola’s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.
"Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,” he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.
Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections.
General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.
"We were very close friends," Babangida recalls.
"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close."
However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.
"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path."
Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.
"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future," he writes.
Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.
The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an "Igbo coup" - a label Babangida rejects.
He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.
The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.
The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.
Babangida writes: "It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.
"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country."
The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war.
Many Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.
"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced," he writes.
"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.
"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow," Babangida says.
He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.

Headline: 'People will starve' because of US aid cut to Sudan
Author: Barbara Plett Usher & Anne Soy, BBC News, Nairobi
Published Date: 2025-02-25T00:16:28.781Z
Text: The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned.
Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.
It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.
The conflict between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.
The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.
"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors," says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. "People are screaming from hunger in the streets."
The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was "serving US interests", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.
The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.
The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance - on which the communal kitchens depend - will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.
The closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.
The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID.
It is a "huge setback" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who has set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms.
The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN.
Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works.
"It was ground-breaking," says Ms Tracy. "The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets [humanitarian group] in Syria."
For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.
There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege.
Most of the kitchens had closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon "we expect to see a lot of people starving".
Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID.
"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens]," she said, "but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was."
"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding," says a member of a former USAID partner organisation.
They are "exhausted, traumatised and underfunded" and "we were scaling up to help them".
The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful.
"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous," it said in response to a BBC query.
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances.
In 2024 the US was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan.
Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries.
"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger," said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month.
The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further.
"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise," says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director.
He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. "We are strained. It's extremely difficult."
They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, "it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger", says Ms Dagesh.
Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority.
"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast," she said.
Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people.
They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing.
Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape.
Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods.
They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight.
With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders.
Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained.
The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise "to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum".
It does not help that the agency was already underfunded.
The UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut "everything", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive.
The US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo.
"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs," Mr Balde told the BBC.
Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on "very dangerous journeys", he says.

Headline: US star John Legend defends playing Rwanda concert during war
Author: Natasha Booty in London & Anita Nkonge in Kigali, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-24T14:59:14.241Z
Text: American singer-songwriter John Legend has told the BBC he is unfazed by a public backlash against his decision to perform in Rwanda, despite the country's involvement in the war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.
"I don't believe that we should punish the people of Rwanda and punish the people of other countries when we disagree with their leaders," he said after last week's concert in Kigali.
In recent weeks, M23 rebels, backed by Rwanda, have seized the two largest cities in the mineral-rich east of the DR Congo.
There is evidence Rwanda has sent 4,000 troops across the border to support the rebels.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are now destitute having fled their homes, and shocking violence, including the rape of children, has skyrocketed.
Critics argue that Legend could have made a powerful statement by pulling out of the concert, especially given his highly respected "EGOT" status as someone who has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.
Fellow Grammy-winner Tems did pull out of a concert she was due to give on Saturday in Rwanda, saying she would "never, ever intend to be insensitive to real-world issues".
But Legend defended his decision to headline the Move Afrika event in Kigali, which was run by the Global Citizen NGO and attracted thousands of fans from across the continent.
He said he was not being paid for the performance but felt it was his duty to help "grow touring capabilities" on the African continent, which is often overlooked by international stars on so-called world tours.
"I'm aware of what's happening [in DR Congo] and I'm aware of the calls there have been for me to not do this show, but I really believe that the mission of Move Afrika is still important," he told the BBC.
Delighted fans at the sold-out show agreed, but the social media backlash was ferocious enough to force Legend to delete an Instagram post he had made promoting the event.
Belgium-based activist Denise Zanesa had argued that "performing under the banner" of Rwanda "would be akin to collaborating with oppression itself", in a message posted to X (formerly Twitter).
It was a sentiment echoed by others, including Simone Umba in the US, who wrote in a TikTok video caption: "So are we ready to talk about Rwanda's use of Black American culture in their soft campaigning to normalise their terrorising of eastern Congo?"
Taking a political stance would have been nothing new for the star.
Legend is outspoken in his criticism of US President Donald Trump. He also severed ties with former mentor Kanye West when he ran for president, suspecting it was part of a wider Trump campaign to "siphon" black people's votes away from the Democrats.
The debate over Rwanda's relationship with popular global figures is also not new.
Most recently, Rwanda has been accused of "sportswashing" - with critics saying it uses the feel-good factor of international football to cover up alleged human rights abuses at home.
The East African nation is said to receive $1bn (£800m) a year in foreign aid and its tourism arm - Visit Rwanda - has lucrative sponsorship deals with Arsenal in England, Bayern Munich in Germany and Paris St-Germain in France.
When asked his thoughts on the topic, Legend's aide told the BBC that he would not answer that question.
It appears that, as far as Legend and his team are concerned, his music itself should do the talking.

Headline: Kenya receives 17 rare antelopes from the US
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News, Nairobi
Published Date: 2025-02-24T14:14:58.228Z
Text: Kenya has received 17 mountain bongos - a very rare type of antelope - from a conservation centre in the United States.
The antelopes are third-generation descendants of mountain bongos taken from Kenya in the 1960s.
The return of the critically endangered animals, from the Rare Species Conservation Foundation in Florida, was hailed as a "monumental step" in Kenya's conservation efforts.
From about 500 in the 1970s, less than 100 mountain bongos are estimated to remain in the wild in Kenya, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).
This was due to habitat loss, poaching, illegal activities, disease and small fragmented populations, the KWS said.
Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano described the arrival of the bongos at the country's main airport on Sunday night as "emotional and so cool", and a benefit for Kenya's tourism and conservation sectors.
The animals were taken to wildlife sanctuaries in Meru county near Mount Kenya, where they will be nurtured before they are gradually introduced to their natural habitat.
Ms Miano said the mountain bongo, "a species originally only found in Kenya, has suffered untold grief over the decades... dwindling to alarming proportions".
She said the plan was to grow the population to 700 by 2050.
The mountain bongo, which has a bright chestnut-red colour with narrow white stripes, is the largest African forest-dwelling antelope, according to the KWS.
It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a Critically Endangered species - with more individuals in captivity than in the wild.
The first repatriation to Kenya was in 2004 when 18 mountain bongos were flown into the country.
KWS director-general Erastus Kanga said Kenya was expecting another batch of the mountain bongos from zoos in Europe in the next three months.
From captivity, the bongos have to go through a series of adaptation phases for them to build the immunity needed to survive in the wild.
In 2022, the head of conservancy at Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy (MKWC) told a Kenyan TV station that some of the bongos repatriated in 2004 had successfully been integrated into the wild and had started breeding.
The MKWC official, Robert Aruho, however, said that others had died from tick-borne diseases, adding that building immunity takes time.

Headline: Sudan army ends two-year siege of key city
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-24T14:01:00.336Z
Text: The Sudanese army says it has broken a near two-year siege imposed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the key southern state capital of el-Obeid.
The breakthrough came hours after the RSF signed a political charter in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to establish a breakaway government in areas under its control.
The RSF and the army have been in a vicious battle for power since April 2023, with tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced from their homes.
The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south.
El-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state, is a strategic hub connecting the capital, Khartoum, to Darfur. This is the latest army advance in recent weeks following the recapture of several parts of Khartoum from the RSF.
There was jubilation on the streets as Sudanese soldiers marched into the city.
A military spokesman, Nabil Abdallah, confirmed the gains in a statement, saying army forces had destroyed RSF units.
Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim said the move was a "massive step" in lifting the RSF siege of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, and would also allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to Kordofan.
Sudanese civil society activist Dallia Abdlemoniem told the BBC Newsday programme that the recapture of the city " was "huge" and "significant".
She said the RSF had "held the civilians captive for nearly two years" in the city.
The situation there was "horrific", she said, adding that there had been no medical or food aid in an area considered "to be very risky in terms of famine and malnutrition". She said she hoped more aid would now be allowed in.
"Lifting the siege brings life back to the city," Ahmed Hussein, a 53-year-old trader in el-Obeid, told the AFP news agency.
Ms Abdelmoniem said the army was "making serious groundwork in terms of moving towards the west, which is where the RSF is mainly centred".
The latest fighting around el-Fasher has forced medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to halt operations at Zamzam, a famine-stricken camp nearby, which houses about 500,000 displaced people.
MSF said it was a "heartbreaking decision" but it had "little choice" because it was too dangerous for its staff to operate there.
Both the army and the RSF have been accused of committing grave atrocities against civilians during the war, with their leaders being sanctioned by the US. In addition, RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide in Darfur.
Both deny the accusations.
Kenya's hosting of the RSF last week as it sought to form a parallel government was criticised by some human rights groups.
On Sunday, Sudan's Foreign Minister Ali Youssef said his country would "not accept" any country recognising "a so-called parallel government".
Earlier, Sudan's military government had warned it would take retaliatory measures against Kenya and has since recalled its ambassador from Nairobi.
In response, Kenya's foreign ministry said there was "no ulterior motive" in "providing non-partisan platforms to conflict parties".

Headline: The Kenyans saying no to motherhood and yes to sterilisation
Author: Danai Nesta Kupemba, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-24T01:31:47.325Z
Text: For as long as Nelly Naisula Sironka can remember she has never wanted children - and with one irreversible decision the 28-year-old Kenyan has ensured she never will get pregnant.
Last October, she took the definitive step of undergoing a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation - permanently closing the door on motherhood.
"I feel liberated," the organisational development expert tells the BBC, adding that it has ensured her future is now entirely her own.
The operation prevents pregnancy by blocking a woman's fallopian tubes and is sometimes referred to as "getting your tubes tied".
Between 2020 and 2023, roughly 16,000 women in the East African country underwent tubal ligation, according to Kenya's health ministry.
It is unclear how many of these women didn't already have children.
Yet Dr Nelly Bosire says the kinds of women coming forward seeking sterilisation in Kenya is changing.
"Traditionally, the most common candidates for tubal ligation were women who already had multiple children," the Nairobi-based gynaecologist told the BBC.
"But now, we are seeing more women with fewer children opting for the procedure."
Sterilisation is only recommended for women who are certain they do not want to have biological children in the future, as reversal is difficult.
"Doctors don't typically encourage tubal ligation because the success rate of a reversal is very poor," said Dr Bosire.
Despite coming from a large family, Ms Sironka said she never felt pressured to start her own - though societal norms in Kenya do place an expectation on women to have children.
She credits her father with her stance as he encouraged her to focus on education - and gave her a love of reading.
Books by US feminist authors like Toni Morrison, Angela Davis and bell hooks were a revelation.
"I interacted with women's life stories that didn't feature children at all," said Ms Sironka, who is now the chief of operations at Feminists in Kenya, an organisation which works to end gender violence.
"It made me realise that a life like this was possible."
She had contemplated sterilisation for years, but decided to go ahead after saving up the money for the operation and finding herself in a stable job that allowed her to take time off.
It cost her 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£190; $230) at a private hospital.
Ms Sironka felt that women's rights were being eroded around the world - especially as women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which also influenced her decision.
It made her fear that a woman's right to control her own body might be eroded elsewhere - and that she should do the procedure while she still could.
"Within Africa and in America, there has been a rise in fascism and authoritarian regimes, a perfect example of such is Kenya," she argued.
When she told her family, it did not come as a surprise to them, as she had always been very vocal about her desire for a child-free life.
And as for dating and relationships?
"I'm still thinking about it," she said with a shrug.
And Ms Sironka is not alone in choosing a child-free life, challenging traditional expectations of womanhood.
Across social media, there are those speaking openly about their choice not to have children and undergo sterilisation.
Among them is Muthoni Gitau, an interior designer and podcaster.
She shared her tubal ligation journey in a 30-minute YouTube video last March, explaining her decision to have the procedure.
"I think the first time I ever articulated... [that] I did not want to have children, I was about 10," she told the BBC.
Her mother was heavily pregnant at the time, and a random question about her future popped into the conversation.
"I saw a possible partner. I saw travelling. I just never saw children," she said.
Like Ms Sironka, Ms Gitau's decision was driven by a strong conviction to live life on her own terms.
After trying birth control pills, which she said made her nauseous, she sought a more permanent solution.
When she first approached a doctor about tubal ligation at the age of 23, she was met with resistance.
She was given what felt like a sermon about how children were a blessing from God.
"He asked me, 'What if I meet someone who wants kids?'" she said.
The doctor seemed to have more consideration for an "imaginary person" rather than the actual patient sitting in front of him, she said.
Ms Gitau said the dismissal was "heart breaking". It was another decade before her wish was finally granted.
Dr Bosire points out that a significant challenge in Kenya is getting medics to shift their mindset and truly appreciate a patient's right to make decisions about their health.
"This ties in with our culture, where people believe it isn't normal for women to want a tubal ligation," she said.
Another Kenyan gynaecologist, Dr Kireki Omanwa, admitted the issue was a matter of debate amongst colleagues and in medical circles.
"It remains inconclusive," he told the BBC.
But Ms Gitau was not deterred and last year approached another doctor - this time at a non-governmental organisation that provides family planning services.
She was armed with a bullet-point list of reasons to support her decision and was relieved to find there there was no pushback: "The doctor was very kind."
Currently single, she is living happily with her decision, which she feels gives her control over her own life.
The 34-year-old is also happy with the reaction to her video - and relieved that there has been no major backlash.
She says most people online have been cheering her on, which has seen her confidence grow.
"Women can contribute to the world in so many other ways," she said.
"It does not have to be through raising a whole human being. I am grateful to live in a generation where choice is a thing."

Headline: Mali to investigate claims soldiers 'executed' women and children
Author: Paul Njie, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-22T19:10:03.252Z
Text: Mali's military government says it is investigating allegations that soldiers "coldly executed" at least 24 civilians in the north of the country on Monday.
That claim was made by a separatist Tuareg rebel alliance, called Azawad Liberation Front (FLA), which is battling the Malian government in the same region.
The FLA accuse Malian forces and Russian Wagner mercenaries of intercepting two passenger vehicles travelling to Algeria from the Malian city of Gao and killing the civilians on board, including women and children.
In a statement, army chief Gen Oumar Diarra said the allegations "relayed by terrorist networks, allies and sponsors" follow other "unfounded" claims against state forces.
For many years, the Malian government has been struggling against both Tuareg rebels seeking a breakaway state in the north and jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.
The military which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021 hired Russian mercenaries from the paramilitary group Wagner to help improve security in the country.
Both government forces and the Russians have often been accused by rights groups of committing gross human rights abuses against civilians, which they deny.
Last month, Mali was one of three countries under military rule to leave the West African regional bloc Ecowas, after refusing its demands to restore civilian rule.
The withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger dealt a huge blow to Ecowas, which at 50 years old is considered Africa's most important regional group.
Mali's military leaders also ended ties with former colonial power France, whose troops left the country in 2022 after more than a decade fighting Islamist insurgents.
The following year, all 12,000 UN peacekeepers left Mali on the junta's instructions.

Headline: Anger as aid worker dies after DR Congo shooting
Author: Natasha Booty, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-22T11:51:01.131Z
Text: An aid worker has died from gunshot wounds in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where Rwanda-backed rebels who captured two key cities in recent weeks are trying to seize more territory.
Jerry Muhindo Kavali, 49, was injured two days ago by a bullet that struck the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) office in Masisi where he was working.
He was taken to hospital in Goma for life-saving treatment but died of his wounds on Saturday.
Colleagues say he was deeply dedicated to humanitarian work and "always had a smile on his face".
Kavali's death has angered aid workers trying to help the tens of thousands of Congolese people whose lives have been destroyed by the war.
"Even war has its rules", said MSF in response to the news.
The town of Masisi, where the MSF worker was shot, has witnessed fierce fighting between militias allied with the Congolese army and rebels belonging to the M23 and Alliance Fleuve Congo rebel groups.
The bullet that killed Kavali was "one of many bullets to hit our premises over recent weeks", the MSF head of programmes Stephan Goetghebuer said.
Key areas already under M23 control include provincial capitals Goma and Bukavu, and the rebels appear to be continuing their advance.
Eastern DR Congo is rich in minerals and this battle for control of the region partly has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
It has been riven by conflict for more than 30 years and attempts in recent years to integrate rebels into the Congolese army have failed.
Experts now fear what effects the conflict will have on the wider East Africa region.
On Friday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution condemning the M23 offensive in eastern DR Congo, urging Rwanda to stop supporting the rebels, and saying they should immediately leave Congolese territory "without preconditions".
This week, the US announced sanctions on M23 Spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka and Rwandan minister James Kabarebe for his alleged role in the conflict.

Headline: How DR Congo's Tutsis become foreigners in their own country
Author: Wedaeli Chibelushi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-22T01:16:14.763Z
Text: The notorious M23 rebel group is wreaking havoc in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the region's two biggest cities in a deadly uprising which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
Central to their campaign is the assertion that ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo are being persecuted.
Digging into the status of Tutsis in DR Congo - and how it relates to the M23 uprising - is a complex and sensitive matter that goes to the heart of who is considered Congolese.
For starters, many global authorities argue that in their purported fight against discrimination, the rebels have committed unjustifiable atrocities. The UN and US, for instance, have sanctioned M23 leaders over allegations of war crimes, such as sexual violence and the killing of civilians.
Secondly, some regional analysts say that rather than seeking to defend Tutsis, the M23 - and Rwanda, which backs the rebel group - is primarily seeking to exploit the eastern DR Congo's vast mineral wealth.
It is also worth noting that there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in DR Congo - there is no official estimate - and many do not support the actions being carried out in their name.
That being said, experts and organisations like the UN have documented decades of discrimination against Congolese Tutsis and the Banyamulenge - a Tutsi sub-group concentrated in the South Kivu province.
This ranges from ethnic killings, to workplace discrimination, to hate speech on the part of politicians.
At the root of this discrimination is the association of Tutsis with neighbouring Rwanda, which has been led by Tutsis since 1994. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Congolese Tutsis played a key role in violent Rwandan-backed rebellions against the governments then running DR Congo.
The perception that Congolese Tutsis are "foreign" can have deadly consequences.
Bukuru Muhizi, a researcher and economist from South Kivu's Mwenga territory, told the BBC that people from various generations of his family had been killed because of their Banyamulenge and Tutsi identities.
He said that in the past six years, his great-uncle and great-uncle's son were killed by Congolese soldiers and local militia fighters. The Congolese armed forces have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on this allegation.
Mr Muhizi said his family has lived in present-day DR Congo for centuries and that he "wished the world knew" his community was experiencing what he called a "silent genocide".
Muragwa Cheez Bienvenue, a Banyamulenge activist, said he was once targeted by airport staff in the city of Bukavu.
"I was stopped - they told me I look like [Rwandan President] Kagame and they had me pay around $150 (£120) to save myself from being imprisoned," he told the BBC, adding that he supports the M23's cause.
Prior to colonisation, part of the territory that is now DR Congo was subject to the Rwandan monarchy, which is Tutsi. It had long been fighting expansionist wars, extending the kingdom to include more and more of East Africa.
Tutsis, Hutus and other ethnic groups lived in the Rwandan kingdom and had done so since at least the 19th Century. But when colonial powers drew up arbitrary borders in Africa, the kingdom was split between present-day DR Congo and Rwanda.
Subsequently, other Tutsis have migrated to DR Congo in waves. In the mid-20th Century, Belgian colonialists brought workers over from present-day Rwanda to staff their plantations, while others came on their own accord in search of a better life.
Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees began arriving in DR Congo, fleeing waves of ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries have long been dominated by their Tutsi minorities, leading to tensions with the Hutu majority.
Many more are thought to have arrived in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered. But when a Tutsi-led government seized power and ended the massacres, some returned, especially after some of those responsible for the genocide then fled into DR Congo.
As DR Congo's Tutsi and Banyamulenge communities grew, the Congolese authorities "alternately empowered and the undermined" them, Jason K Stearns, a DR Congo analyst, wrote in his book The War That Doesn't Say Its Name.
In the early 1970s, then-President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to anyone who had originated from Rwanda or Burundi, provided they were present on Congolese territory before 1960.
But in 1981, parliament rowed back on these rights and many Tutsis, Banyamulenge and people from other minority groups were "derived of their nationality and left stateless", a UN report noted.
In the 1990s, Tutsis and the Banyamulenge were subject to multiple massacres in DR Congo. For instance, a report by the UN says that the Congolese army aided armed groups in killing nearly 300 Banyamulenge civilians in the city of Baraka in 1996.
It also states that "many" Tutsis and Banyamulenge lost their jobs and suffered discrimination and threats.
Today, the constitution considers the Tutsi and Banyamulenge groups to be Congolese and some individuals from these communities occupy senior military and governance positions. In fact, Lt-Gen Pacifique Masunzu, the man leading the fight against the M23 as the commander of a key area in eastern DR Congo, is from the Banyamulenge community.
But there is still significant evidence of discrimination. In 2024, experts working for the UN said that in South Kivu, Banyamulenge are commonly seen as harmful to their neighbouring communities. This discourse incites "hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence", the experts said.
There have also been recent reports of Tutsi and Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese army being murdered. According to Human Rights Watch, a mob killed a Banyamulenge military officer in 2023 "in an apparent case of ethnic hatred".
Politicians - past and present - have also pushed discriminatory sentiment.
Anti-Tutsi feelings appear to rise during M23 rebellions, say DR Congo experts such as Mr Stearns.
He told the BBC he had seen "pretty terrifying" social media posts over the past few weeks - "a phenomenon of people in other parts of the country expressing doubts over a certain person, often an army officer or police officers... the way he looks, and claiming that certain people look like they're Rwandan".
Although some Congolese Tutsis may back the M23's current uprising, Mr Stearns says "many of them feel uncomfortable with the consequences this will have for them as a community, because once again, this means that they will be portrayed as treasonous rebels".
The Congolese government has gone some way in acknowledging the discrimination against Tutsis. For instance, earlier this year President Félix Tshisekedi said he had "had enough" of anti-Banyamulenge speech and alleged that such comments gave Rwanda the pretext to invade DR Congo.
However, the authorities have also played down allegations of widespread persecution. Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told the BBC: "We have 450 tribes and there is conflict between some of them in many parts of the country... The government position is against any kind of discrimination or hate speech against every community".
Mr Bienvenue on the other hand told the BBC he "strongly" believed his ethnic group was discriminated against, giving the example that his sister was once sacked after being told she "looked like a Rwandan spy".
This is despite his family living in the same area for centuries.
"The Banyamulenge have been here since Congo was Congo!" he said, exasperated.

Headline: South Africa invites Ukraine's Zelensky for state visit
Author: Khanyisile Ngcobo, BBC News, Johannesburg
Published Date: 2025-02-21T14:17:54.351Z
Text: South Africa is set to host Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on a state visit, President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed on X without giving a specific date.
The invite comes at the end of a week which saw Kyiv excluded from US-Russia talks on how to bring an end to the three-year war in Ukraine.
In a phone conversation, Ramaphosa and Zelensky "agreed on the urgent need for an inclusive peace process", according to a statement from the South African president. A sentiment Zelensky echoed by saying "nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine".
South Africa, which has in the past been accused of having a closer relationship with Moscow, has tried to play a role in finding an end to the fighting.
In 2023, Ramaphosa led a delegation consisting of seven African countries, including Egypt, Senegal, Zambia, and Uganda, and met Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
South Africa has historic ties with Russia, and both countries form part of the influential Brics bloc - an alliance of major economies that also includes Brazil, India and China.
Ramaphosa, in a post shared on his X page, said: "I welcome the constructive engagement I had with President [Zelensky] and I look forward to hosting him in South Africa soon for a state visit."
Zelensky, on his part, said he had thanked Ramaphosa for "South Africa's support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity" in their conversation. "We all hope to achieve a just and lasting peace this year," he added.
Ramaphosa and Zelensky have had regular conversations since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - and have met in person - but despite Zelensky's interest in a state visit to South Africa, there has been no movement to make this happen until now.
The Ukrainian leader back in December expressed his interest in coming to South Africa during an engagement with African journalists at the International Food Summit, according to South African online publication News24.
"I will be in Pretoria with pleasure, but you must ask Mr Ramaphosa because I think he is more busy," he told the publication.
Dr Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, hailed the planned state visit as a "brilliant" move by South Africa – because it not only allows Kyiv a platform to express its concerns amid the US-Russia talks but sends "a number of messages globally".
"Ramaphosa is being clever because [US President Donald] Trump might want to dismiss South Africa as a... small African country but we are yet again able to demonstrate that we can operate above our station internationally."
He added that Zelensky may be appealing to South Africa due to the country's relationship with Russia and its role as an "honest broker" with no vested interest in the war.
Zelensky's continued engagement with world leaders comes amid its increasingly tense relationship with the US, which it considers a key ally.
The tension took a turn for the worse this week when Trump accused Zelensky of being a a "dictator" who has "done a terrible job".
South Africa's invite also comes at a time of increasingly strained relations with the US. The Trump administration recently cut off aid to the country over a new land expropriation law.
Ramaphosa has said that his country "will not be bullied".

Headline: Nigeria ex-military leader for first time admits regret over cancelled poll
Author: Chris Ewokor, BBC News, Abuja
Published Date: 2025-02-21T13:05:27.383Z
Text: Nigeria's ex-military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida has expressed deep regret for the first time for annulling the results of the 1993 presidential election.
The poll was supposed to bring about an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. The date of the vote – 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.
Gen Babangida was forced to resign. Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.
Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.
The former military leader, 83, expressed his regret at the launch of his autobiography A Journey in Service in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday.
"Undoubtedly credible, free and fair elections were held on 12 June 1993," he told the audience made up of the cream of Nigerian society, including Tinubu, two former presidents – Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan - and two other ex-military leaders, Abdulsalam Abubakar and Yakubu Gowon.
"However, the tragic irony of history remains that the administration that devised a near-perfect electoral system and conducted those near-perfect elections could not complete the process.
"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret."
Gen Babangida, popularly known as IBB, also acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, won the election.
However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.
For three decades, the circumstances surrounding the 1993 election have been shrouded in controversy, with conflicting accounts emerging overtime.
This new admission, seen as reopening old wounds, has triggered fresh debates rather than closure.
Many people will be expecting the former military ruler to also provide answers to some questions relating to his policies at the time.
Gen Babangida, who overthrew another military leader Muhammadu Buhari in 1985, led the county for eight years.
Multiparty democracy did eventually return to Nigeria in 1999 with the election of Obasanjo – who had also been a former military leader – as president.

Headline: Veteran Ugandan politician charged with treason
Author: Swaibu Ibrahim, BBC News, Kampala
Published Date: 2025-02-21T11:46:40.406Z
Text: Veteran Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye has been charged with treason in a civilian court after his controversial case was transferred from a military tribunal.
Treason is a capital offence in Uganda and if found guilty the 68-year-old cold be sentenced to death.
He was charged alongside two other suspects, but they did not enter a plea on the grounds that the charges against them could only be heard in a higher court.
Besigye, who has run for president against long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni four times, has been in detention since he was dramatically abducted in Kenya in November and taken back to Uganda to face a military trial.
But a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court last month said that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional and ordering all such cases to be transferred.
The move angered President Museveni, who called it "a wrong decision".
At the start of last week, Besigye had begun a hunger strike over his continued detention.
The charges stem from accusations that he was plotting to remove Museveni from power by force.
Friday was the first first time Besigye had appeared before a civilian court for formal charges, after the Supreme Court ruling.
Visibly frail, he was wheeled before the Nakawa magistrate court in the capital, Kampala, alongside his aide and co-accused Obeid Lutale.
The opposition politician has now called-off his hunger strike, his lawyer Erias Lukwago told journalists.
According to the charge sheet presented before court, Besigye is accused of holding meetings in Switzerland, Greece and Kenya between 2023 and November last year in a plot to overturn the government.
He was also accused of soliciting for military, financial and other logistical support to topple Museveni's government.
Besigye was charged alongside Mr Lutale and Denis Oola, a military officer.
Previous charges heard in the military court of illegal possession of ammunition and treachery were not included in the new charge sheet.
During proceedings, Besigye's lawyer asked the court to order that he be transferred to a better health facility outside the prison but Magistrate Esther Nyadoi dismissed the application, saying she was unable to grant such a request.
She ordered the accused to be remanded until next month to allow the prosecutor to finish the investigation.
Besigye used to be a personal doctor for Museveni, who has been in power since 1986.
The veteran opposition figure has previously accused the Ugandan authorities of political persecution.
He has been less active in politics in recent years, and did not contest the 2021 election.

Headline: Rwanda angered by US sanctions over DR Congo violence
Author: Wycliffe Muia, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-21T10:00:59.540Z
Text: The Rwandan government has condemned the US decision to sanction a government minister for his alleged role in the conflict in the east of neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.
Announcing the financial sanctions on Thursday, the US Treasury Department said Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration James Kabarebe, a former army chief, was central to his country's support for the M23 rebel group.
Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controls in Britain and France, the US Treasury said.
On Friday, the UK said there would be "consequences" for Rwanda over its alleged role in DR Congo.
Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions would not resolve the conflict in the DR Congo, terming them "unjustified and unfounded".
They come as the M23 appears to be continuing its advance after capturing two major cities in recent weeks in the mineral-rich east of DR Congo.
The rebel group, mainly comprised of ethnic Tutsis, has seized the cities of Goma and Bukavu - sparking a major humanitarian crisis that left families devastated.
Western powers have accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 with arms and as well as backing from the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF), accusations Rwanda denies.
The US Treasury Department on Thursday said Kabarebe was sanctioned because "he is central to Rwanda's support" for the M23 armed group.
It said Kabarebe together with Kanyuka were "linked to violence and human rights abuses" in DR Congo.
"Today's action underscores our intent to hold accountable key officials and leaders like Kabarebe and Kanyuka, who are enabling the RDF and M23's destabilising activities in the eastern DRC," said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.
"The United States remains committed to ensuring a peaceful resolution to this conflict."
But Rwanda dismissed the US action, saying Kigali's aim was only to secure its border and an "irreversible end to the politics of armed ethnic extremism in our region".
"Rwandans have the right to live in peace and without the perpetual threat of insecurity originating from the DRC," the ministry statement stated.
"Punitive measures, including sanctions, make no contribution toward long-term security, peace and stability for all the countries of the Great Lakes region," it added.
DR Congo welcomed the US sanctions, saying it wanted to see more such measures.
"This marks the beginning of a long series of sanctions that we want to be more robust from the UN Security Council, the European Union and other partners in order to force Rwanda to withdraw its troops and cease its criminal activities on our soil," government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said in a statement posted on social media.
Addressing G20 foreign ministers in South Africa on Friday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy termed the reported involvement of Rwandan troops a "blatant breach of the UN Charter which risks spiralling into a regional conflict".
Speaking at the venue Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira condemned the recent attacks on the UN forces and regional peacekeepers in DR Congo.
For its part, China maintained that it "firmly supports the African people in independently resolving African problems and opposes external interference in the internal affairs of African countries".

Headline: Trailblazing African film-maker and Cannes winner dies
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-20T09:21:05.133Z
Text: Malian film director Souleymane Cissé, one of the pioneers of African cinema, has died aged 84.
His daughter, Mariam Cissé, confirmed his death at a clinic in the capital Bamako, expressing shock and mourning "the loss of a man who dedicated his life to film and art".
The cause of his death has not been announced.
Cissé gained international recognition in 1987 when his film Yeelen (The Light) won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the first film-maker from sub-Saharan Africa to win an award at the prestigious festival.
His trailblazing career spanned more than 50 years, winning many accolades along the way.
In 2023, Cissé was honoured by Cannes with a Carrosse d'Or award, usually given to directors who have "marked the history of cinema with their boldness, their exacting standards and their intransigence in staging".
Cissé was also a double winner of the grand prize at the biennial Pan-African Film Festival, Fespaco.
At the time of his death he had been due to travel to Burkina Faso to preside over the jury at the festival, which opens on Saturday.
Tributes have been pouring in for Cissé for his dedication to African storytelling.
Mali's Culture Minister Mamou Daffé lamented the loss "of this monument of African cinema", while fellow Malian director Boubacar Sidibé said the country's film industry was in "mourning".
Film lovers have praised Cissé's works for their complexity, political engagement and deep humanity.
His first feature film, Den Muso (The Young Girl) shot in 1975, was in the local Bambara language, and is considered an African classic.
The film is about a young girl who is raped, becomes pregnant and is rejected by her family.
The film was banned by the Malian authorities, and Cissé was jailed for having accepted French funding. He wrote the screenplay for his second film, Baara (Work), while in prison.
He made other films including Finyè (The Wind) in 1981, and Yeelen (The Light), which won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 1987. His last film in 1995 was Waati (Time).
Cissé was born in Bamako, and spent part of his childhood in neighbouring Senegal.
Later, he studied film in Russia's capital Moscow, becoming one of the first generation of African film-makers.
Cissé went on to champion government support for and investment in the film industry.
He was the founding president of the union representing West Africa's entrepreneurs in cinema and audiovisual arts.
Cissé was often outspoken about other barriers to the spread of African cinema - criticising "censorship" and "contempt", and urging young film-makers not to act like "beggars who must plead every time for financing from Europe" but instead seek greater independence.
Hours before his death, he reportedly urged Mali's military government to help the country's industry catch up with its continental rivals.
"It is not enough to make cinema, the works must also be visible," the AFP news agency quoted Cissé as saying.
"May the authorities help us with the construction of cinemas."

Headline: 'Robbers stole the crosses from my daughter's and my mother's graves for scrap'
Author: Alfred Lasteck, BBC News, Morogoro
Published Date: 2025-02-20T01:28:35.942Z
Text: Grave after grave after grave in this cemetery in the eastern Tanzanian city of Morogoro has been vandalised.
In some, there is a gap where a metal crucifix once stood, in others the religious symbol is bent as thieves, who were hoping sell it to scrap merchants, tried and failed to remove it.
More than 250 have been targeted in one small section of the Kola Municipal Cemetery alone.
The crimes mostly happen at night when there is no security and there are no cemetery workers around.
They have left families devastated and the sites desecrated, sparking anger.
For more than two decades, Pudensiana Chumbi has been going to the cemetery about once a month to visit the graves of her daughter and mother - and to her distress both have been desecrated over the last few years, multiple times.
The first to be targeted was the grave of her mother who died in 2000.
A few months after the family had managed to save up to replace the stolen cross in late 2021, her daughter's grave was damaged. It was nearby and a little older - her daughter had died in 1997 aged 15.
Before Ms Chumbi could make a decision about fixing her daughter's cross, to her horror the new cross on her mother's grave was stolen.
In a quandary about what to do next, she felt metal was not an option when it came to replacing her daughter's cross.
"This is my child's grave - my fourth child," she said pointing towards the concrete cross.
The theft of crosses and markers from graves has become a disturbing trend in this part of Tanzania, driven by the rising demand for scrap metal.
"The people doing this are cursed because everyone is sad about what is going on," Ms Chumbi tells the BBC.
"There are some young men who now demand payment to guard graves overnight, especially those with tiles."
Tiles can also be sold on for people to use as decorations in their home.
Augustine Remmy, Ms Chumbi's brother, says it is upsetting for the whole community.
"This is too bad… when these areas that deserve respect are subjected to such bad acts, it truly hurts a lot," he tells the BBC.
The rash of thefts reflects a desperation among some to make some money that overrides ethical concerns about damaging sacred sites.
The criminals can earn between 700 and 870 Tanzanian shillings ($0.27-$0.34; £0.22-£0.28) per kilogramme.
It is not a huge amount of money but it can be enough to pay for a plate of food from a vendor or some locally brewed alcohol.
"Metal dealers often buy without asking questions," says one man who admitted to the BBC that he had stolen crosses from a cemetery to sell on the scrap metal market.
Agreeing to speak on condition of anonymity, he describes how the thieves would first go to welders who cut the crosses into pieces before taking them to the scrap merchants.
The merchants are faced with the choice of buying cheaper stolen goods or abiding by the law.
Izire Ramadhani, a dealer in Morogoro city centre, recalls how in 2023 he, along with some other scrap merchants, caught someone trying to sell a stolen cross and reported him to the authorities.
"In the past, they used to bring us crosses. But then we took one of them to the police, and later he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison," Mr Ramadhani tells the BBC.
He says this led to a reduction in the theft of crosses, although there has been a recent increase.
Mr Ramadhani insists that he does not buy stolen goods.
"If a cross is brought here, the person coming to sell to us will be in trouble because we will take him to the police."
Thieves have also begun targeting other grave markers like tiles and marble decorations, which can easily be sold on to other buyers.
Dr Ndimile Kilatu, Morogoro's health officer, said the city's authorities planned to improve cemetery security by introducing fences and guards but warned that "this requires resources and time.
"It is not something that we can do today or tomorrow."
He also mentioned initiatives to educate scrap metal dealers about the materials that should not be bought, such as grave markers and railway components.
Tanzania's government has also pledged to regulate the scrap metal industry.
Deputy Prime Minister Dotto Biteko has emphasised the need for licensed businesses to adhere to the laws and regulations.
"What is required is just to enforce that and keep the population educated on the same subject. We will keep so educating our people so that we put our infrastructure safe," he told the BBC.
Religious leaders are also appealing to their communities to do more to prevent those involved in these crimes from carrying them out.
Pastor Steven Msigara from the Jesus Assembles of God in Morogoro has called for a united effort to educate young people on the need to respect sacred places.
"Together, we must restore their dignity, we know some youth are exposed to bad acts but we can return them to the right track," he says.
For relatives of those whose graves have been desecrated, there is a feeling of frustration.
Ms Chumbi wants more money to be spent on security at the cemeteries as well as a commitment to look after the sites with care befitting a place where loved ones are laid to rest.
She is in the process of replacing her mother's cross for a second time - and, as in her daughter's case - is opting for concrete.

Headline: Uganda discharges Ebola patients
Author: Makuochi Okafor, BBC Africa health correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-19T17:50:44.258Z
Text: Uganda has discharged eight patients who have recovered from the Sudan strain of Ebola after they tested negative twice, health officials have said.
The disease has killed one person and infected eight others since an outbreak was reported last month, but 265 people, who were listed for monitoring, remain in quarantine.
This is the eighth Ebola outbreak in Uganda since the first infection was recorded in 2000.
The Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (SUDV) is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues. It is one of several strains of the Ebola virus known to cause outbreaks.
Unlike the more common Zaire Ebola virus, there is no approved vaccine for the Sudan strain.
However, the government launched a trial vaccine earlier this month.
Only a 32-year-old male nurse is known to have died in the latest outbreak.
Uganda's Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero confirmed the discharge of the eight patients, and said they should not be stigmatised.
"I urge their families and communities to receive and interact with them normally," the minister added.
The UN World Health Organization (WHO) said their recovery was "an important milestone" in efforts to contain the outbreak.
The Sudan strain is severe, normally killing at least 40% of those infected, but the fatality rate this time is low, the WHO said.

Headline: South Africa's finance minister fails to unveil budget after tax row
Author: Khanyisile Ngcobo, BBC News, Johannesburg
Published Date: 2025-02-19T16:44:56.451Z
Text: South Africa's Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana has been forced to postpone the unveiling of the national budget following sharp disagreements within the coalition government.
Coalition partners derailed his budget after opposing his plan to raise value-added-tax (VAT), which would have seen the prices of goods go up at a time when South Africans are hard-hit by the cost-of-living crisis.
Godongwana is a member of the African National Congress (ANC), which was forced to enter into a coalition after losing its parliamentary majority in elections last year.
His failure to table the budget sent shockwaves in South Africa, as it has never happened since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.
The currency plummeted against the US dollar, as markets reacted negatively to the news.
The Democratic Alliance (DA), which is the second-biggest party in the coalition, was one of the most vocal critics of the proposed budget.
Its leader John Stenhuisen said the party could not in "good conscience" agree to a VAT increase from 15% to 17% as it would have "broken back the back of our economy".
VAT was last increased in 2018 from 14% to 15%.
The ANC's other coalition partners, like the Freedom Front Plus, said they were only told of the proposed hike before Godongwana was due to table the budget.
Godongwana told journalists that the planned increase was mentioned in the cabinet last week.
The budget will now be tabled on 12 March, following further discussions to iron out differences, he said.
The opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) expressed dismay over the postponement, saying it was a "symptom of weak, indecisive, and opportunistic governance".
But the DA hailed the postponement as a "victory", and said it would push for a budget that is "better for growth and employment".

Headline: Netherlands to return stolen Benin Bronzes to Nigeria
Author: Danai Nesta Kupemba, BBC
Published Date: 2025-02-19T13:39:24.994Z
Text: The Netherlands says it will return more than 100 Benin Bronzes that British troops looted from Nigeria in the late 19th Century and which ended up in a Dutch museum.
Thousands of these culturally significant sculptures and carvings were stolen during the violent destruction of Benin City, in modern-day Nigeria's Edo state, in 1897.
The treasures were sold, some to private collectors and others to museums like the Wereldmuseum in The Netherlands, which has displayed the artefacts for decades.
The return of the 119 artefacts was the "largest repatriation of Benin antiquities", said Olugbile Holloway, director-general of Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).
Despite the name, not all the statues are made of bronze. They include figurines, tusks, sculptures of Benin's rulers, and an ivory mask. They were made during between the 15th and 19th Centuries.
A transfer of agreement is due to be signed on Wednesday. Mr Holloway added that he hoped this would set a good example for other countries.
In 2022, Germany was the first to return over 20 Benin bronzes in a bid to deal with its "dark colonial history".
"With this return, we are contributing to the redress of a historical injustice that is still felt today," said Dutch Minister of Culture, Education, and Science Eppo Bruins, reports the AFP news agency.
The sculptures, prized for their beauty and technical artistry, are of spiritual and historical significance for the people from that part of Nigeria.
Their theft still remains a point of pain for the descendants of those from the ancient Benin kingdom.
This move may increase pressure on other institutions to return the Benin Bronzes, especially the British Museum, which has more than 900 artefacts.
Protests and demonstrations have taken place outside the British Museum as part of a campaign for their return.
However, an act of parliament prevents the British Museum from sending them back.
For many in Nigeria, the Benin Bronzes are a potent reminder of the violence of colonialism.
The NCMM has issued formal repatriation requests to museums across the world.
Nigeria said it plans to open the Edo Museum of West African Art in Benin City in 2026, designed by the British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye, to house the largest collection of Benin Bronzes ever assembled.

Headline: Even in his final seconds of life, first gay imam pushed boundaries
Author: Khanyisile Ngcobo, BBC News, Johannesburg
Published Date: 2025-02-19T00:16:15.080Z
Text: The execution-style killing of an openly gay imam, Muhsin Hendricks, in South Africa has left people in the LGBTQ+ community fearful for their safety - but also determined to forge ahead with the campaign to end their marginalisation in religious circles.
Reverend Toni Kruger-Ayebazibwe, an openly gay Christian cleric, told the BBC that Hendricks was a "gentle spirit" who brought light into any room he occupied.
"The gap Muhsin leaves is massive," she said, adding that she knew for a fact that there were "a large number of queer Muslims around the world who are grief stricken".
The 57-year-old was shot dead in what appeared to be a hit on Saturday in the small coastal city of Gqeberha.
Initial reports that Cape Town-based Hendricks had been in Gqeberha to perform the wedding ceremony of a gay couple have been dismissed as untrue by his Al-Gurbaah Foundation.
"He was visiting Gqeberha to officiate the marriages of two interfaith heterosexual couples when he was tragically shot and killed," it said in a statement.
It is unclear why the couples had asked Hendricks to oversee their ceremonies, but it suggests that he was pushing the boundaries, even in the last seconds of his life.
Traditional imams in South Africa rarely, if ever, perform the marriage of a Muslim to a non-Muslim - something that Hendricks clearly had no issue with.
He had, according to a faith leader that the BBC spoke to, conducted one such marriage ceremony and was on his way to conduct the next one when he was gunned down in his vehicle.
Two leading bodies that represent imams - the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) and the United Ulama Council of South Africa (UUCSA) - condemned Hendricks' killing.
"As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views," the MJC said, while the UUCSA said it condemned "all forms of extra-judicial killings".
However, Hendricks - who did his Islamic studies in Pakistan - was a pariah in their circles, as they hold the view that Islam prohibits same-sex relations.
They pointedly referred to him as "Mr Hendricks", rather than by religious titles like imam or sheikh.
In contrast, Hendricks' supporters hailed him as the world's first openly gay imam who made it possible for them to reconcile their sexuality with their Islamic faith.
That he was a trail-blazer is not surprising - South Africa's constitution, adopted in 1996 after the end of white-minority rule, was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation.
Then in 2006, South Africa became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage.
Once in a heterosexual marriage with children, Hendricks came out as gay in 1996 - and, according to The Conversation, he later broke another taboo by marrying a Hindu man.
He then spearheaded the formation of The Inner Circle as "an underground social and support group" for queer Muslims.
It started out at his home in Cape Town, and has "proven to be very successful in helping Muslims who are queer to reconcile Islam with their sexuality", The Inner Circle's website says.
Despite South Africa having a thriving LGBTQ+ scene, members of the community still face some stigmatisation and violence.
Only a few of the country's religious groups have adopted policies that are more favourable towards the community, among them the Dutch Reformed Church and the Methodist Church of Southern Africa.
The Dutch Reformed Church was in 2019 forced by the courts to reinstate a policy it had introduced four years earlier, but then scrapped, allowing same-sex marriages and for gay and lesbian pastors to be in romantic relationships.
The following year, the Methodist Church said that while it was "not yet ready to apply for its ministers to officiate at same-sex marriages", no congregant residing in a member country that recognised civil unions would be "prevented from entering into such a union which can be as same-sex or opposite sex couples".
Reverend Ecclesia de Lange, the director at Inclusive and Affirming Ministries (IAM), told the BBC that even in instances where faith groups had adopted inclusive policies there were still "pockets of very strong conservatism".
"The traditional interpretations of sacred texts continue to exclude LGBTQ+ people, so the struggle for acceptance within faith communities remains ongoing," she said.
Senior lecturer in Islamic Studies at South Africa's University of the Western Cape, Dr Fatima Essop, reflected on the "distressing" vitriolic content circulating on social media in the wake of Hendricks' killing.
"I just find that completely shocking and so far removed from our... Islamic tradition, which is all about compassion and mercy and preservation of human life," she told the BBC.
Dr Essop added that while she understood some of the strong feelings against Hendricks' work, there was "absolutely no justification, Islamic or otherwise, for this kind of violence".
And while the motive is unclear, Hendricks' killing - and the negative comments that followed - was likely to make people fearful to "speak about their sexuality or sexual orientation", Dr Essop said.
Reverend Kruger-Ayebazibwe said that while Hendricks' shooting would make LGBTQ+ leaders rethink their security, it would not deter them from campaigning for change "because the work matters too much".
Hendricks has already been buried at a private ceremony, though his Al-Gurbaah Foundation has pledged to organise a memorial in the near future to "honour his immense contributions".
For Teboho Klaas, the religion programme officer at The Other Foundation, which champions LGBTQ+ rights in southern Africa, his killers may have cut his life short "but not his legacy because he has multiplied himself".

Headline: Rebels leave families devastated in wake of DR Congo advance
Author: Orla Guerin, BBC News, Goma
Published Date: 2025-02-18T17:52:14.175Z
Text: Heshima winces in pain as he tries to shift his weight, sweat beading on his face. The slight 13-year-old sits on a bed in a tent in the grounds of an overcrowded hospital in Goma city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Heshima's left leg is a bandaged stump, his stomach is streaked with burn marks, and both of his parents have been killed.
A relative, Tantine, tells us who is to blame: M23 rebels - backed by Rwanda and battling the Congolese army, known as the FARDC. The rebels now control the two largest cities in this mineral-rich area, which borders Rwanda.
"It was a Sunday," she says. "There was fighting between them and the FARDC. They dropped the bomb, and I lost six members of my family."
The M23 portray themselves as freedom fighters, bringing peace and order to a failed state, and a failed leader in Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi.
The rebel group, mainly comprised of ethnic Tutsis, has been on the march since early 2022, seizing swathes of territory - with the help of up to 4,000 Rwandan troops.
That is according to UN experts who say Rwanda has "de facto control" over the group - claims Kigali and Rwandan President Paul Kagame deny.
The price of the M23's gains can be counted at Ndosho Hospital, where Heshima is being treated.
Doctors are struggling to clear a backlog of civilians and soldiers wounded at the end of January, when the rebels took Goma. The M23 say they "liberated" the city.
The death toll in the fighting was close to 3,000 people, according to a UN estimate.
Four operating rooms are in use - simultaneously - throughout the day and sometimes at night.
"It's been a terrible situation for the doctors," says Myriam Favier of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which supports the hospital.
The medics have been sleeping in the operating theatres, she says.
"Our medical supplies were looted at the very beginning of the escalation of the conflict. And we had an influx that was unseen before - between 100 and 150 patients a day for weeks."
That is now down to about 10 admissions per day, according to Ms Favier, and "right now people are just trying to live again".
Drive around Goma and the streets hum with motorbikes. Many shops are open, and pavement sellers are back with their piles of onions and avocados and tomatoes.
There is little sign of well-armed M23 fighters. They do not stand on street corners. They don't need to. Everyone knows they are in charge.
People would accept the devil here, one local man said, if they thought he would bring peace.
Others are more wary. A journalist said many in the media are "self- censoring" what they report, waiting to gauge how the new rulers will behave.
One activist told me many were "living in a big silence" because of fear of reprisals by the rebels.
"This is the most worrying period of Goma's history," he said. "I am afraid, the future is very uncertain."
Not according to the M23.
"Expect peace, security, development, job creation… a future with zero refugees, zero corruption, zero hunger," Willy Manzi, a newly appointed M23 vice governor who has recently returned from Canada, posted on the social media platform X.
But a different message was delivered to tens of thousands of people who have sought refuge from fighting in recent years in a network of camps in Goma.
They were given 72 hours to go. The M23 want the camps erased, along with any rival armed groups hiding in them.
"They came and told us, 'You have three days to leave,'" says Divine, 19, who has one child on her hip, and another at her feet.
"We were very scared because we have nowhere to go. Our houses have been destroyed. Hunger is killing us here, but how we can go home to nothing?"
As she speaks a crowd gathers around us. There are silent nods and worried faces.
"They were our enemies and now they are our neighbours," says one man, who asks not to be named.
Home for Divine is Bulengo camp - an expanse of scrappy white tents, perched on dark volcanic rock, surrounded by green hills.
Many of the shelters are little more than scraps of tarpaulin. But the camp was something to cling to - until the M23 ultimatum.
When we visited many were already packing up, salvaging bits of wood and plastic, and rolling up bedding.
After ordering people out the camps the M23 later said they were "encouraging voluntary returns".
It does not feel voluntary to many of the displaced.
Human rights groups say it fits a pattern of abuses by the rebels who they accuse of indiscriminate shelling, gang rape and summary executions.
They level the same accusations at the Congolese army and their allies.
The decades long conflict has its roots - in part - in the Rwanda genocide of 1994, when around 800,000 people, mostly Tutis, were killed by Hutu extremists.
Afterwards many Hutus fled into DR Congo, including some involved the genocide. Rwanda says they remain a threat.
Critics say Kigali has its eye on DR Congo's vast mineral wealth, crucial for much of the world's technology including laptops and mobile phones.
There are growing fears that the scramble for control of these riches could trigger a new regional war, with implications far beyond Africa.
Either way - if history is any guide - the treasures beneath the soil are unlikely to benefit the people here.
Back at Bulengo camp we met Alphonsine, who was leaving with her extended family, bent double with the weight of belongings tied to her back.
She said it would be a two day walk to reach her area, and there was nothing to go back to. Her home had been destroyed.
"How will you survive?" I asked.
"I came from suffering," she said, "and I leave in suffering."

Headline: Villagers killed execution-style in Sudan, activists say
Author: Natasha Booty, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-18T13:33:35.362Z
Text: More than 200 unarmed civilians have been killed in a cluster of villages in Sudan over three days by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that is involved in a brutal conflict with the military, a local rights group has said.
The Emergency Lawyers network said the attacks happened in al-Kadaris and al-Khelwat towards the north of White Nile state - areas where the military had no presence.
RSF fighters were guilty of "executions, kidnappings, enforced disappearances and property looting", the network added.
The RSF, which was allied to the military before the civil war broke out in April 2023, has not commented on the allegations.
The two had come to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.
Some senior RSF leaders are currently in Kenya where they are expected to announce plans to form their own government in areas under their control.
Analysts warn the move could deepen divisions in Sudan.
Humanitarians have been sounding the alarm over Sudan, where the conflict has forced about 12 million people from their homes.
Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, with both the RSF and army accused of committing atrocities.
At the heart of this conflict is a falling out between Sudan's de facto ruler and army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan "Hemedti" Dagalo, who leads the RSF.
The RSF was recently dealt a significant blow when the army regained control of parts of the capital, Khartoum - including its military headquarters.
Beyond the capital, the army has also won near total control of the crucial state of Gezira.
Following the setbacks, the RSF has rebounded with plans to launch a rival government in areas still under its control, which are mainly in Darfur and parts of Kordofan state.
The RSF is meeting allied groups in Nairobi to finalise the adoption of what it calls a "political charter for the Government of Peace and Unity".
Gen Burhan has rejected the move, and has vowed to reclaim the whole of Khartoum.
He is currently based in Port Sudan, having been forced to leave Khartoum months after the civil war broke out when the RSF seized the military headquarters and the presidential palace.

Headline: Detained Ugandan opposition figure treated in clinic overnight
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-17T17:05:30.864Z
Text: Detained Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye, on hunger strike for a week, has been returned to prison after being in a clinic overnight, his allies have said.
The 68-year-old was rushed to a private medical facility in a prison ambulance as his his health was deteriorating, his lawyer Erias Lukwago wrote earlier on Facebook.
Besigye was charged in a military court with illegal possession of a firearm, threatening national security, as well as treason, which carries the death sentence. He denies the accusations.
The news about his health came hours after a cabinet minister said he had seen Besigye in jail. He urged him to resume eating and pledged to drop his military trial.
Another leading opposition politician, Bobi Wine, along with human rights activists, went to the prison on Monday to visit Besigye.
But Bobi Wine said that prison officers refused to let them see him as he was very weak.
"This man is actually dying. Dr Besigye is in a terrible state. He cannot leave his bed," Bobi Wine told reporters as he called for his release.
He added that Besigye's co-accused, Obed Lutale, "told us that Besigye collapsed this morning when they were trying to carry him out of his bed".
When contacted by the BBC, Uganda Prisons spokesperson Frank Baine refused to comment.
"I said no comment, that is enough," he added.
Besigye, who has run for president against long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni four times, has been in detention since he was dramatically abducted in Kenya in November and taken back to Uganda to face a military trial.
Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional.
The government had insisted Besigye's military trial would continue and President Museveni dismissed the ruling as "a wrong decision", vowing to challenge it.
But on Sunday, Information Minister Chris Baryomunsi said he had seen Besigye in prison "in the presence of his doctors" and had asked him to end the hunger strike "as the government fast-tracks the transfer of his case from a court martial to a civil court".
Besigye's wife, Winnie Byanyima, however said the visit was "highly suspicious".
"As a government minister, you are not a concerned visitor - you are his captor," Ms Byanyima, who is the director of the UN's HIV/Aids programme, posted on X.
"We will hold you and your government fully accountable for any harm that comes to him," she added.
On Sunday night, a lawmaker allied to the detained politician said Besigye had been taken to a clinic in a suburb of Kampala "amidst very heavy security deployment".
Francis Mwijukye added Besigye was "being pushed in a wheel chair".
Wafula Oguttu, a former leader of the opposition in parliament and a Besigye ally, said prison officers around the clinic told him they would take him back to jail after a series of tests had been conducted.
Oguttu told the BBC that he had not been allowed to enter the clinic.
One of Besigye's political aides, Harold Kaija, said he was now back in prison.
Besigye went on hunger strike a week ago to protest against his continued detention by the military, with his trial yet to start.
He is a former ally of Museveni - who has been in power since 1986 - and was once his personal doctor.
Besigye has previously accused the authorities of political persecution. In recent years he has been less active in politics and did not contest the 2021 election.
Besigye appeared before a court on Friday - in a separate case - looking frail. The Ugandan medical doctors' association has since called for his "immediate release" on health grounds.
There have increasing calls by the family, opposition and human rights groups for Besigye to be released on medical grounds.

Headline: Mauritius ex-PM bailed after 'suitcases of cash' arrest
Author: Yasine Mohabuth, BBC News, Port Louis
Published Date: 2025-02-17T15:43:20.439Z
Text: Mauritius' former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has been released on bail following his dramatic arrest on Saturday on money laundering charges.
He had been detained along with three others after the anti-corruption agency said it had seized suitcases of cash and luxury watches in raids on 10 locations, including Jugnauth's home.
The former prime minister's lawyer said he denied the charges against him.
Jugnauth's arrest came 100 days after his landslide defeat in elections, with his successor Navin Ramgoolam vowing to root out corruption. But few Mauritians expected the Financial Crimes Commission (FCC) to move so quickly, or to arrest the former prime minister on such serious charges.
Some people took to the streets of the capital, Port Louis, to celebrate by lighting firecrackers, while a handful of his supporters turned up outside court on Monday to show their solidarity with him, chanting: "Pravin! Pravin!"
His wife Kobita - who is not facing the charges - was released after being questioned for hours by investigators on Saturday.
Her 63-year-old husband spent the night in a detention centre, before a magistrate granted him bail late on Sunday, setting it at $32,000 (£26,000).
Jugnauth's co-accused - two prominent businesspeople and a deputy mayor - are still in detention, pending the outcome of their bail applications.
Their lawyers have not yet commented on the charges against them.
About $2.4m in local and foreign currencies - including US dollars, euros and UAE dirhams - were seized during the raids, FCC spokesperson Ibrahim Rossaye said.
Seven luxury watches, including five high-end Cartier timepieces, were also confiscated, he added.
As part of his bail conditions, Jugnauth has been ordered not to contact witnesses or to interfere with them.
He must also stay at a fixed address and must inform the police if he decides to relocate.
Jugnauth was the prime minister from 2017 to 2024 and is a member of one of the dynasties that has dominated politics in Mauritius.
Jugnauth oversaw a historic deal with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer regarding the future of the Chagos Islands.
The agreement aims to settle the long-standing sovereignty dispute over the islands, but his successor has accused him of negotiating a bad deal and has reopened talks.

Headline: South Africa police 'hot on heels' of suspects in gay imam killing
Author: Damian Zane, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-17T13:24:42.249Z
Text: Police in South Africa are "hot on the heels" of the suspects behind the killing of Muhsin Hendricks, dubbed the world's first openly gay imam, Deputy Justice Minister Andries Nel has said.
The 57-year-old was in a car when he was shot dead in broad daylight in the coastal city of Gqeberha on Saturday.
CCTV footage of the incident shows a hooded figure running out of a pick-up truck that was blocking Hendricks' vehicle and then firing shots through the window.
The imam was well known for his work in creating a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims and his killing shocked the LGBTQ+ community and beyond.
An investigation is under way but Nel told the Newzroom Afrika TV channel that it was too early to say whether it was a hate crime.
Without giving further details, Nel said he was told by Deputy Police Minister Polly Boshielo that officers were tracking down the suspected killers.
Paying tribute to Hendricks, Nel said that he "was a South African that we can all be proud of, a South African that we can all aspire to be".
Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam, which oppose same-sex relations.
While being clear that it did not agree with Hendricks, South Africa's Muslim Judicial Council (MJC), one of the country's main religious bodies, condemned the killing.
"As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views," it said.
Another leading Muslim body - the United Ulama Council of South Africa -condemned "extrajudicial killings" and urged people not to jump to conclusions about the motive.
South Africa's constitution, adopted after the end of white-minority rule in 1994, was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation and in 2006, became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage.
But despite a thriving LGBTQ+ community, gay people still face discrimination and violence. The country also has one of the highest murder rates in the world.
Hendricks came out as gay in 1996, which shocked the wider Muslim community in his home city of Cape Town and elsewhere.
That same year, he founded The Inner Circle, an organisation providing support and a safe space for queer Muslims seeking to reconcile their faith and sexuality before going on to establish the inclusive Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque.
He was the subject of a documentary in 2022 called The Radical, in which he said about the threats he faced: "The need to be authentic was greater than the fear to die."
Hendricks often spoke about the importance of interfaith dialogue and the need to address the mental health issues and trauma faced by LGBTQ+ individuals within religious communities.
He told the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association World Conference in Cape Town last year: "It is important that we stop to look at religion as the enemy."

Headline: What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?
Author: Damian Zane, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-16T20:17:39.007Z
Text: The mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Numerous armed groups have competed with the central authorities for power and control of the potential fortune in this vast nation.
The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect – notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people.
After a rapid advance in the east, fighters from the M23 rebel group have captured a number of key cities and towns.
Their first major coup was at the end of January with the taking of Goma – a city in the North Kivu province that is home to more than a million people.
Sitting on the border with Rwanda and the shores of Lake Kivu, Goma is a vital trading and transport hub that is within reach of mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand.
When the rebels took over Goma, UN aid agencies warned of a major humanitarian crisis with shortages of food and water, hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and bodies lying on the streets.
The M23 have also seized another key city in the region, South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu.
Other locations now under M23 control include Masisi, Rutshuru and Katale.
The rebels previously threatened to continue their offensive to the capital, Kinshasa, although analysts say this may be unlikely, as the city is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away, on the other side of this vast country.
The M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group.
They say that several previous deals to end the fighting have not been respected - they take their name from a peace agreement that was signed on 23 March 2009.
Shortly after its creation in 2012, the M23 rapidly gained territory and seized Goma – acts that were met with international opprobrium and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations.
It was forced to withdraw from Goma, and then suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Congolese army along with a UN force that saw it expelled from the country.
M23 fighters then agreed to be integrated into the army in return for promises that Tutsis would be protected.
But, in 2021, the group took up arms again, saying the promises had been broken.
M23 leader Sultani Makenga is a Congolese Tutsi who previously fought in the Rwandan army.
Rwanda has in the past consistently denied that it supported the M23, but ever since 2012 UN experts have accused it of providing weapons, logistical support and even ultimately commanding the rebels.
DR Congo's government, as well as the US and France, have also identified Rwanda as backing the group. Last year, a UN experts report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the M23.
On Friday, Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told the BBC that the country's troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over to its territory.
Rwanda previously said it was being scapegoated and blamed the recent fighting on the Congolese authorities, saying they had refused to enter into a dialogue with the M23.
A peace process, mediated by Angola and involving Rwanda and DR Congo, did result in a ceasefire deal last year, however that soon fell apart and fighting resumed.
The origin of the current fighting can partly be traced back to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
About 800,000 people – the vast majority from the Tutsi community - were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists.
The genocide ended with the advance of a force of Tutsi-led rebels commanded by Paul Kagame, who is now president.
Fearing reprisals, an estimated one million Hutus then fled across the border to what is now DR Congo. This stoked ethnic tensions as a marginalised Tutsi group in the east – the Banyamulenge – felt increasingly under threat.
Rwanda's army twice invaded DR Congo, saying it was going after some of those responsible for the genocide, and worked with members of the Banyamulenge and other armed groups.
After 30 years of conflict, one of the Hutu groups, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which includes some of those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, is still active in eastern DR Congo.
Rwanda describes the FDLR as a "genocidal militia" and says its continued existence in the DR Congo's east threatens its own territory. The Rwandan spokesperson said they wanted to return to Rwanda to "finish the job".
It accuses the Congolese authorities of working with the FDLR - accusations which DR Congo denies.
Rwanda is unlikely to stay out of DR Congo unless it is satisfied that the FDLR is no longer a threat to itself, or to the Tutsi communities in eastern DR Congo.
DR Congo and multiple UN reports have accused Rwanda of using the conflict as a way of looting Congolese minerals, such as gold and coltan, which is used to make mobile phones and other electronic items such as cameras and inside cars.
In recent years, the M23 has seized several lucrative mining areas and a report by UN experts last December said that around 120 tonnes of coltan was being sent by the M23 to Rwanda every four weeks.
They also noted a huge rise in Rwanda's mineral exports in recent years, most of which is believed to come from DR Congo.
Rwanda has consistently denied allegations of exploiting DR Congo's minerals.
A UN peacekeeping mission has been in place since 1999. The current force – known as Monusco – is made up of more than 10,000 troops.
However, of these, only the Force Intervention Brigade is allowed to carry out offensive operations against armed groups. It was this force that helped defeat the M23 in 2013.
Monusco has been the target of anger from ordinary Congolese who see it as failing to do its job. President Félix Tshisekedi, deeming the mission a failure, had asked it to leave by the end of last year.
But the departure was delayed and in December the mission was extended for another year.
The Southern African Development Community (Sadc), a regional grouping of 16 countries, has also deployed a military force to eastern DR Congo, but it has been unable to halt the rebels.
South Africa has said 14 of its soldiers have died in clashes with the M23. Soldiers from the likes of Malawi and Tanzania have also been killed.
Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, warned Rwanda that further attacks on its troops would be considered a "declaration of war".
Rwanda's President Paul Kagame hit back, accusing South Africa of being part of a "belligerent force" involved in "offensive combat operations".
The UN said that Uruguay had lost one of its soldiers who was part of the Monusco force.

Headline: Second DR Congo city falls to Rwanda-backed rebels
Author: Emery Makumeno, BBC News, Kinshasa
Published Date: 2025-02-16T17:36:50.112Z
Text: Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have entered Bukavu, the second-largest city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the regional governor's office.
Some people lined the streets to clap and cheer the fighters as they marched and drove into the city centre without resistance. It is the second city after Goma to fall to the rebels in the mineral-rich region in the past few weeks.
The Congolese government has acknowledged its fall and urged residents to stay at home "to avoid being targeted by the occupying forces".
The UN and European countries have warned that the latest offensive, which has seen hundreds of thousands of people forced from their homes, could spark a wider regional war.
A resident in Bukavu, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns for her safety, told the BBC on Sunday that most people were still afraid to leave their homes.
"Since yesterday the children and the youth took the weapons. They are shooting everywhere in all directions, they are looting," she said.
"This morning the M23 entered and they were acclaimed by the people, very happy to see them. We don't know if it's because they are afraid or because they found that there were no authorities in the city.
"The place where I live the crackling [gunfire] can still be heard."
On Friday, the M23 captured Bukavu's main airport, which is about 30km (18 miles) north of the city - and then began advancing slowly towards the city, which is the capital of South-Kivu province.
The provincial governor, Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki, confirmed to the Reuters news agency the fighters were in Bukavu city centre by Sunday morning, adding that Congolese troops had withdrawn to avoid urban fighting.
This left a security vacuum in the city on Saturday with chaotic scenes playing out, including a reported prison break from the central prison.
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said a warehouse with nearly 7,000 tonnes of food was looted.
The city of around two million people on the southern tip of Lake Kivu borders Rwanda and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.
Its fall represents an unprecedented expansion of territory for the M23 since their latest insurgency started in late 2021 - and is a blow to the government of President Félix Tshisekedi.
Government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said Rwanda was violating DR Congo's territorial integrity through expansionist ambitions and human rights abuses.
The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region - as well as having troops on the ground - so it can benefit from its natural resources, something Kigali denies.
President Tshisekedi wants his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to face sanctions over the latest unrest.
But President Kagame has dismissed such threats - and has repeatedly pointed out that Rwanda's main priority is its security.
He has long been angered by what he sees as the failure of the Congolese authorities to deal with the DR Congo-based FLDR rebel group, which he sees as a danger to Rwanda.
The group is made up of some members of the ethnic Hutu militia accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda when over 100 days around 800,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi ethnic group, were killed.
Troops from the Tusti-led M23 gathered at the Place de l'Indépendance in central Bukavu on Sunday, where one of its commanders, Bernard Byamungu, was filmed chatting to locals and answering their questions in Swahili.
He urged government forces "hiding in houses" to surrender - and accused the withdrawing military of spreading terror by arming local youths who had gone on a looting rampage.
The African Union (AU) - which has been holding a heads of state summit in Ethiopia this weekend - again urged the M23 to disarm.
"We are all very, very concerned about an open regional war," Reuters quotes the AU's peace and security commissioner Bankole Adeo as saying.

Headline: Dozens killed in Mali illegal gold mine collapse
Author: Ian Aikman & Thomas Naadi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-16T15:50:35.596Z
Text: More than 40 people, mostly women, were killed after an illegal gold mine collapsed in Mali on Saturday.
The collapse took place near Kéniéba, in Mali's western, gold-rich Kayes region.
The victims had climbed into open-pit areas left by industrial miners to look for scraps of gold when the earth around them caved in, a gold miner's union leader told Reuters.
This is Mali's second deadly mining accident in three weeks, after at least 10 people were killed when a mining tunnel flooded late in January.
There are conflicting reports on the number people who died in Saturday's accident.
A local police source told the AFP news agency that 48 people were killed in the collapse, while the head of an industry union told Reuters there were 43 victims.
"Some of the victims fell into the water. Among them was a woman with her baby on her back," the local police source told AFP.
Rescue workers have been able to retrieve the bodies, local sources told the BBC.
Mali is one of the biggest gold producers in the world.
Accidents are common in the country as much mining activity is unregulated, with miners using unsafe methods to dig for gold.
Just over a year ago, at least 40 people were killed after a tunnel collapsed in a mine.
It is also common for illegal miners - mostly women - to try to recover gold from abandoned sites due to poverty.
A spokesperson from the country's mines ministry confirmed to Reuters that the accident had taken place between the towns of Kéniéba and Dabia, but declined to give further details.
Ministry teams are drawing up a report at the scene, Reuters reports.
The collapse on Saturday occurred at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, according to AFP.
Beijing is heavily invested in developing Mali's mining industries, with the approval of its government.
Since Mali is rich in natural resources, including gold, iron ore, manganese, lithium, and uranium, it is an attractive destination for Chinese investors.
While such investment has improved Mali's infrastructure, especially in the transportation sector, the government has accumulated significant debt obligations to China, raising concerns about its ability to repay the loans.
Chinese mining activities have also been criticised for contributing to environmental pollution in the country.
Mali is currently engaged in a dispute over revenue sharing with one of the largest mining companies in the country, the Canadian firm Barrick.
Last month, the Malian government seized gold bars worth $245m (£194m) from Barrick and issued an arrest warrant for its CEO, Mark Bristow.
Mr Bristow said he had "no doubt" the conflict would be resolved in an interview with Bloomberg this week.

Headline: World's 'first openly gay imam' shot dead in South Africa
Author: Todah Opeyemi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-16T12:26:11.223Z
Text: Muhsin Hendricks, a pioneering figure dubbed the world's first openly gay imam, has been shot dead in South Africa.
The 57-year-old cleric ran a mosque in Cape Town intended as a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims. He was killed on Saturday morning after the car in which he was travelling near the southern city of Gqeberha was ambushed.
"Two unknown suspects with covered faces got out of the vehicle and started firing multiple shots at the vehicle," police said in a statement.
News of Hendricks' death has sent shockwaves through the LGBTQ+ community and beyond, prompting an outpouring of tributes from across the globe.
Julia Ehrt, executive director at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (Ilga), called on the authorities to thoroughly investigate "what we fear may be a hate crime".
"He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith, and his life has been a testament to the healing that solidarity across communities can bring in everyone's lives," she said.
Hendricks was killed after he had reportedly officiated at a lesbian wedding, though this has not been officially confirmed.
The details of the attack emerged through security footage that was shared on social media.
It shows a car pulling up and blocking the vehicle in which Hendricks was travelling as it was pulling away from the curb. According to police, the imam was in the back seat.
The angle of CCTV footage reveals what happened from one side of the road - an assailant jumps out of a car, runs to the ambushed vehicle and shoots repeatedly through the back passenger window.
Hendricks' Al-Ghurbaah Foundation, which runs the Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque in the Wynberg suburb of Cape Town, confirmed he had died in a targeted attack on Saturday morning.
But Abdulmugheeth Petersen, chair of the foundation's board, appealed via a WhatsApp group for their followers to be patient, stressing the importance of protecting Hendricks' family.
Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam and championed a compassionate, inclusive faith.
South Africa's post-apartheid constitution was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation and in 2006, became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage.
But despite a thriving LGBT community, gay people still face discrimination and violence. The country also has one of the highest murder rates in the world.
Hendricks came out as gay in 1996, which shocked the wider Muslim community in Cape Town and elsewhere.
That same year, he founded The Inner Circle, an organisation providing support and a safe space for queer Muslims seeking to reconcile their faith and sexuality before going on to establish the inclusive Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque.
He was the subject of a documentary in 2022 called The Radical, in which he said about the threats he faced: "The need to be authentic was greater than the fear to die."
Hendricks often spoke about the importance of interfaith dialogue and the need to address the mental health issues and trauma faced by LGBTQ+ individuals within religious communities.
He told the Ilga World Conference in Cape Town last year: "It is important that we stop to look at religion as the enemy."
Reverend Jide Macaulay, an openly gay Anglican minister, described Hendricks' death as "truly heartbreaking".
The British-Nigerian LGBTQ rights activist runs House of Rainbow, an organisation that provides support for gay people in Nigeria where same-sex relationships or public displays of affection are illegal, and paid tribute to Hendricks' bravery.
"Your leadership, courage, and unwavering dedication to inclusive faith communities have left an indelible mark," he said.
Sadiq Lawal, a gay Muslim man living in Nigeria, told the BBC that Hendricks, had made such an impact as he had made "the impossible possible" by saying the words: "I'm a queer imam."
"He's a mentor to many queer Muslims in Africa, especially in Nigeria, because of religious extremism," he said.
"I'm still in shock and devastated."

Headline: Why Uganda's iconic crested crane faces extinction
Author: Wycliffe Muia, BBC News, Mbarara
Published Date: 2025-02-16T02:48:15.767Z
Text: With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.
All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.
The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; £4m) for those found to have killed one.
Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.
It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.
"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed," Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.
But for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.
"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area," Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.
Another farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.
"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything," she told the BBC.
Also known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
They are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.
Standing at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.
But with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.
"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years," Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.
In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.
This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.
"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction," Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.
Around Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn.
Conservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.
Dozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.
"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage," Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.
Mr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.
Farmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.
"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage," he told the BBC.
However, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.
"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes," he told the BBC.
Sarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.
Cranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.
"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying," Ms Kugonza told BBC.
Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.
But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.
"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero," said Mr Muheebwa.
They attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.
Scientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.
Any destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.
Their monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.
"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you," Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.
This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.
And in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.
President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.
The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.
Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained "very low".
For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.
"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes," he said.

Headline: Gunfire and looting in DR Congo city as rebels advance
Author: Alex Therrien, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-15T17:53:04.637Z
Text: Chaotic scenes have been unfolding in Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as the M23 rebel group continues its offensive in the region.
On Saturday there were reports of sporadic gunfire and widespread looting in the city, including at a World Food Programme depot, with residents sheltering in their homes.
It follows conflicting reports about whether the Rwanda-backed rebels had entered the key city of Bukavu, after advances in the region. On Friday M23 fighters seized Kavumu airport, north of Bukavu.
The UN and the European Union have voiced alarm over the worsening conflict.
A threat by Uganda's army chief to attack a Congolese town has sparked fears the conflict could flare into a wider regional war.
UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres told an African Union summit on Saturday a regional escalation must be avoided "at all costs" and there was "no military solution".
"And the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC must be respected," Guterres continued.
The European Union said it was "urgently" considering all options following the news from Bukavu.
"The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered," it warned.
The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its natural resources - a claim Rwanda has denied.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance.
On Saturday, the streets of Bukavu were deserted as residents hid in their homes.
One woman in the city told the BBC people were avoiding going outside as gunfire rang out and youths looted and destroyed shops.
"I only have enough food for three days. As a woman it is difficult for me to go outside because I could be raped [by the looters or the armed groups]. We feel abandoned by the authorities."
The looting included the World Food Programme's depot in Bukavu, which housed 6,800 metric tons of food, a spokesman for the UN aid agency told the Reuters news agency.
Claude Kalinga said the stealing of supplies would deepen the difficulties faced by those in need. The agency had already suspended its activities for weeks due to the deteriorating security situation.
There have been conflicting reports over whether M23 fighters have entered Bukavu, as the group claims, and to what extent.
Two residents of the northern Bukavu suburb of Bagira said they had seen rebels on the streets and no sign of fighting.
However, an M23 source, two Congolese army officers and multiple Bukavu residents, on Saturday told Reuters that the rebels had not yet entered the city centre.
The capture of Bukavu, a city estimated to have an urban population of more than a million people, would represent an unprecedented expansion of territory under the M23's control since the latest insurgency started in 2022.
Bukavu, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.
Meanwhile, on Saturday, the chief of Uganda's defence forces, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a post on X he would attack the town of Bunia, also in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, unless "all forces" there surrendered their arms within 24 hours, igniting fears of a wider conflict.
The threat by Kainerugaba, whose father is the president of Uganda, adds to fears that the region risks slipping back into a broader war reminiscent of conflicts in the 1990s and 2000s which killed millions.
Uganda's military since 2021 has supported the Congolese army in its fight against Islamist militants in the east, but UN experts say Uganda has also backed the M23 group.
The mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect – notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people.

Text: M23 rebels in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have entered Bukavu, the eastern region's second-largest city.
Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance which includes M23 rebels, told Reuters news agency the rebels had entered the South Kivu provincial capital on Friday evening and would continue their advance on Saturday.
The Rwandan-backed militants' progress comes despite international calls for a ceasefire and a resumption of peace talks.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance.
Last month, the Tutsi-led M23, which is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, seized Goma, the main city in the mineral-rich east. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied.
The M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region.
The city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.
Earlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 30km (19 miles) north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance.
But there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC.
In a village further north - Mayba - 70 bodies were found in a church, according to local media reports.
A local community coordinator in North Kivu, Vianney Vitswamba, told the DR Congo news agency 7Sur7 that the bodies were found tied up. Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels - an Islamic State-linked group - were blamed, but the BBC has not confirmed the report.
Residents of Bukavu contacted by the BBC said the authorities advised residents to remain indoors.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be sanctioned, accusing it of having "expansionist ambitions", the AFP news agency reports.
"We will no longer put up with our strategic resources being plundered for the benefit of foreign interests under the complicit gaze of those who feed on chaos," he is quoted as saying.
As well as being accused of backing the rebels, which Rwanda has denied, the country is also said to have its own troops in eastern DR Congo.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has said his country's priority is security. He has said Rwanda is in danger from Hutu rebels in DR Congo and has dismissed any threat of sanctions.
The news of the latest advance comes as the continent's heads of state are due to meet at an African Union (AU) summit in Ethiopia on Saturday.
The head of the AU commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat is quoted by AFP as saying that a ceasefire "must be observed" adding that "military campaigns are not going to solve these problems. There is a general mobilisation of Africa today on this issue and I hope that we will be able to impose this ceasefire".

Headline: Liberian president suspends hundreds of officials over asset declaration failure
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-14T11:25:07.735Z
Text: Liberian President Joseph Boakai has suspended more than 450 top government officials for failing to declare their assets to the anti-corruption agency.
They will be off work without pay for a month or "until they submit the required declarations", according to the presidency.
Boakai said that the officials had contravened the code of conduct for state officials by not being transparent about what they own.
The president, who had pledged to fight corruption when he came into office last year, said failure to comply undermined efforts to combat corruption and ensure accountability.
The law requires all public officers to declare their wealth before taking up their posts and when they leave positions in government.
The Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) published the list of all the 457 affected public officials, noting it was doing so as prescribed by law.
Boakai, who pledged to fight corruption when he came into office last year, said failure to comply undermined efforts to combat corruption and ensure accountability.
"Public officials are reminded that asset declaration is not only a legal obligation but also a fundamental measure to promote transparency and restore public trust in governmental institution," he said in a statement.
Last July, the president announced that he was reducing his salary by 40%, saying he hoped to set a precedent for "responsible governance" and demonstrate "solidarity" with Liberians.
The government of his predecessor, George Weah, had faced accusations of corruption and lavish spending, sparking mass protests amid a rise in the cost of living.
On Wednesday, some of the suspended officials visited the anti-corruption commission offices in order to comply with the requirement.
There has been mixed reaction over the president's move.
Political analyst Abdullah Kiatamba was quoted by Liberian newspaper FrontPage Africa as being supportive of the president's anti-corruption stance, but raised concerns about the challenges some officials faced in submitting their asset declarations.
Civil society group Solidarity and Trust for a New Day described Boakai's move as insufficient.
"Suspending these officials for just one month is a meaningless, symbolic gesture - a slap on the wrist that no serious person should take seriously," it said in a statement.
Update 14 February: References to the ministers of health and education being among those censured have been removed as they said they had filed their declarations.

Headline: DR Congo singer killed filming music video in war-torn Goma
Author: Emery Makumeno & Wycliffe Muia, BBC News Kinshasa & Nairobi
Published Date: 2025-02-14T08:06:42.348Z
Text: A popular Congalese musician has been killed while filming a music video in Goma, which was overrun by M23 militants, after releasing a song condemning the rebel occupation of the city.
The body of Delphin Katembo Vinywasiki, better known as Delcat Idengo, was found in a street on Thursday with his head partially covered with blood. Unconfirmed reports say the artist was shot.
Idengo, who was a critic of all sides in the conflict, was among hundreds of inmates who escaped from a prison in Goma, after the militants seized the city last month.
The east of DR Congo has been engulfed in fighting as armed groups and the army battle it out for control of the mineral-rich region.
It is not clear who was behind the killing.
"Justice will be done," government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya posted on X platform, terming the musician's killing an "abominable act". He blamed the M23.
But the M23 pointed the finger at government-aligned forces, calling on them to hand over their weapons.
The killing comes amid growing tension in the area after the Rwanda-backed M23 captured Goma, in a major escalation of the fighting in late January.
Around 2,900 people have been killed and about 700,000 others forced from their homes in the recent hostilities, the latest UN figures suggest.
The rebels are now pushing towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu - another key city in the region - despite regional peace efforts to end the conflict.
Idengo's death has sparked fresh fears in North Kivu as protesters took to the streets of Beni, where he was born, to demand justice.
Videos shared on social media showed the musician's body lying on the ground after the incident in the Kilijiwe area, in the north of Goma.
According to the witnesses, Idengo, who was wearing military trousers for the video, died on the spot after the attack.
The Congolese ministry of arts and culture described the incident as an "assassination".
"A committed voice, he carried, through his music, the aspirations and hopes of an entire generation," the ministry posted on X.
Idengo was awaiting trail after his jailing last year for inciting people to take up arms and force UN peacekeepers to leave the country.
In 2021, he was prosecuted for insulting President Félix Tshisekedi and spreading "false rumours" in one of his songs where he accused the president of not fulfilling his promises. He was sentenced to 10 years, but was later acquitted.
"The nation has lost a patriot committed to national cohesion. I mourn the loss of Idengo. It is high time for this war to end. Humanity above all!" Martin Fayulu, an opposition leader who came third in the 2023 general election, posted on X.
Moïse Katumbi, another opposition figure who came second in the election, condemned Idengo's killing.
"His murderers, whoever they are, must be quickly identified and very severely condemned," Katumbi posted on X.

Headline: Ghana's ex-finance minister declared a fugitive
Author: Thomas Naadi, BBC News, Accra
Published Date: 2025-02-12T19:32:30.846Z
Text: Ghana's former finance minister Ken Ofori-Atta has been declared a fugitive by prosecutors over his alleged involvement in multiple corruption cases when he was in government.
Ofori-Atta had left Ghana to evade investigations, and all necessary steps would be taken to bring him back, Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyabeng said.
Ofori-Atta has been accused of causing financial losses to the state, including over a controversial national cathedral, which remains a hole in the ground despite the alleged spending of $58m (£46.6m) of government money.
Ofori-Atta has not commented on the allegations. According to Agyabeng, the ex-minister's lawyers said he was out of the country for medical reasons.
Agyabeng told a press conference that Ofori-Atta, 66, failed to attend an interview with the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), despite being told he was a suspect.
Ofori-Atta left Ghana in early January, and had no intention of "willingly" returning, Agyabeng said.
The OSP was, therefore, declaring him a "wanted person".
"He is a fugitive from justice," the special prosecutor added.
Ofori-Atta was finance minister from January 2017 to February 2024, when the New Patriotic Party (NPP) was in power.
It lost elections in December to the National Democratic Congress (NDC).
President John Mahama, who was inaugurated in January, went on to establish an investigative committee known as Operation Recover All Loot.
The committee has received over 200 complaints of corruption, amounting to more than $20bn in recoverable funds.
Mahama has directed the attorney general and minister of justice to launch investigations into these allegations, stating that Ghana will no longer be a safe haven for corruption.
However, some Ghanaians have criticised him for discontinuing cases against his former allies on trial.

Headline: Sudan fighters accused of storming famine-hit camp
Author: Barbara Plett Usher, Africa correspondent

Text: A paramilitary force in Sudan has stormed the country's largest displacement camp, looting and setting fire to the market and several homes, a local refugee group has said.
The Zamzam camp in North Darfur has been hit by intense artillery shelling since late last year, but this is the first time the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been accused of sending in fighters.
An eyewitness told the BBC the situation at the camp was "extremely catastrophic", and there were many casualties.
The nearby city of el-Fasher, one of the centres of the civil war that erupted in 2023, is already under siege by the RSF as it battles the army.
The military and RSF had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.
The Sudanese IDPs and Refugees Bloc said Zamzam camp was invaded on Tuesday.
However, an RSF spokesman denied its fighters had penetrated it, saying they had seized a nearby military base belonging to an armed group that fights alongside the Sudanese military, after it had shelled RSF checkpoints for days.
BBC Verify has confirmed social media footage that shows men waving guns triumphantly with flames behind them and saying they are in the camp.
The insignia has been removed from their uniforms, but the man filming the video has RSF markings.
Asked about the damage to the market the RSF spokesman said the group had "circulated a message in which we committed to protect the camp residents and asked them to stay away from the fire exchange areas".
Zamzam hosts about half a million displaced people who were already suffering from famine.
Reports said the attack forced thousands of them to flee again.
Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which runs a hospital in Zamzam, said it had received seven dead bodies and 21 injured people at the hospital it runs in Zamzam.
Most of them were in a serious condition, but the hospital lacked the ability to care for all of them, an MSF spokesperson added.
The eyewitness the BBC spoke to said the hospital no longer had a functioning surgery.
North Darfur's Health Minister Ibrahim Abdullah Khater told the BBC that the wounded were not able to reach el-Fasher for treatment because the RSF was blocking the road and preventing access to the city.
"The ones suffering the most are the displaced people," he said.
The humanitarian catastrophe worsened late last year when Zamzam came under heavy artillery fire, which aid organisations, including MSF, blamed on the RSF.
A group of international non-governmental organisations issued a statement in December, saying the attacks on Zamzam marked "an escalation in violence on a site which has previously been spared from active hostilities", although it was "consistent with a pattern of attacks" on other camps for displaced people.
"This underscores the reality that there are now no safe places for people to flee to in North Darfur," it said.
The siege of el-Fasher began last April - a year into the conflict.
It is the only city still under army control in Darfur, where the RSF has been accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities.

Headline: US aid pause hits DR Congo humanitarian work - UN
Author: Wedaeli Chibelushi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-12T13:58:21.152Z
Text: A pause in US foreign aid has "severely impacted" humanitarian efforts in conflict-hit Democratic Republic of Congo, a senior UN official in the country has said.
Bruno Lemarquis told reporters that DR Congo was the largest recipient of US humanitarian assistance last year - 70% of the African country's aid had come from Washington.
US President Donald Trump's decision to pause all international aid was, therefore, a "major source of concern", Mr Lemarquis said.
The suspension comes as intense clashes between the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group and DR Congo's army worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis.
Approximately 700,000 people are said to have been forced from their homes since the fighting escalated last month.
In Goma, a city captured by the M23 last month, residents told the BBC of damaged livelihoods and hospitals overwhelmed by those injured in conflict.
The risk of epidemics such as cholera and mpox were also high in Goma, Mr Lemarquis said during Tuesday's briefing.
He added that an increased number of residents needed food aid as prices had risen, but the US pause on foreign aid hindered agencies from tackling these issues.
"Our ultra dependence on US funding means a lot of programmes had to shut down on everything we are doing. So, it's emergency health, it is emergency shelter." Mr Lemarquis said.
President Trump froze all foreign assistance provided by the United States, by far the world's biggest aid donor, on his first day back in office, calling for a review to ensure it abided by his "America First" foreign policy.
Trump's administration has targeted the government's main overseas aid agency, USAID, saying its spending is totally unexplainable.
The dramatic suspension of humanitarian assistance has hit programmes across the world - one veteran humanitarian worker told the BBC the pause was "like an earthquake across the aid sector".
Pepfar, a ground-breaking US programme countering the global spread of HIV, is among those that have been heavily impacted.
"The program is shuttered…. Services are shut," Dr Atul Gawande, the former Assistant Administrator for Global Health at USAID, told the BBC last month.
He said clinics that served 20 million people with HIV were affected.
And in Syria, water, sanitation and security services were all upended at the al-Hol displacement camp following Trump's directive.
Critical services have also been hit in Afghanistan, a country whose health sector receives a huge portion of its funding from the US.
A doctor responsible for USAID-funded projects there told the BBC that more than 60 of his team, including midwives, nurses and doctors, were told to stay at home after funding was paused.
"If the funding halt continues, mothers will be forced to give birth at home as the facilities are closed and it will increase mortality rates," one midwife said.

Headline: Oil clean-up 'scam' warnings ignored by Shell, whistleblower tells BBC
Author: Simi Jolaoso, BBC News, Niger Delta
Published Date: 2025-02-12T01:24:41.327Z
Text: A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption.
The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well.
But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (£805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.
One close observer has described the clean-up project as a "con" and a "scam" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.
Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: "The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.
"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities."
The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.
The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.
Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.
It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable.
The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago.
The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.
The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods.
Grace Audi, 37, lives with her partner and two-year-old in Ogale in Rivers state, where there have been at least 40 oil spills from Shell's infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, the UK-law firm representing the communities in this case.
Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, £2.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8.
It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state.
Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.
"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere," the 50-year-old mother of six said.
Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.
"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick.
"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering."
In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area.
It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.
It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.
The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).
This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.
Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $270m.
However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.
One person aware of the project spoke to the BBC about their concerns - and asked to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.
"It's common knowledge that really what we're doing is a scam. Most of it is to fool the Ogoni people," the whistleblower said.
"It's a con perpetuated so that more money can be put into the pot and end up in the pockets of politicians and other people in power."
The allegations about failings at Hyprep include:
In the minutes of one meeting in 2023, attended by representatives from Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the UNEP and Hyprep, it was pointed out that "incompetent" contractors were "being engaged again" and that they should "not be allowed to further degrade the environment".
In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were "regularly reported with deviations".
In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the "extremely poor standards" of the clean-up would continue.
The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.
But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.
In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the "institutional challenges" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of "future funding" towards it.
Shell told the BBC: "Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative."
This is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched.
In 2015, Shell agreed to a £55m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.
The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.
However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.
Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as "oil bunkering".
"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard," Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.
"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.
"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution."
Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.
The company said: "We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads."
The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.
Some locals have accused the oil giant of "running away" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.
They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.
"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life," Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.
"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to.
"It is unclear how Renaissance [Africa] will act going forward. At least with Shell we have means of holding them to account."
Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which comes from the Niger Delta region.
Locals, whose main source of livelihood has been agriculture and fishing, told the BBC that since the discovery of oil, or what some refer to as "black gold", their home had been pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.
They say they have seen no benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe who blames recent oil spills in Rivers state for her failing crops.
"Formerly if I harvest I can eat some with my family and even sell some… but for the past few years I could not get anything. It's really bad," the 42-year-old the BBC.

Headline: Rebels attack DR Congo army ending lull in fighting
Author: Wedaeli Chibelushi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-11T17:18:09.241Z
Text: The Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have attacked Congolese government forces in the South Kivu province, breaking a two-day lull in fighting.
Heavy shelling began on Tuesday morning, three days after a summit of East and Southern African leaders called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.
The rebels have seized vast swathes of land in the eastern DR Congo, including the major city of Goma.
They are now pushing towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu - another key city in the region.
Around 2,900 people have been killed since early January as a result of the hostilities, the latest UN figures suggest.
Approximately 700,000 others are estimated to have been forced from their homes and thousands more injured.
Tuesday's fighting erupted near Ihusi, a locality around 70km (43 miles) from Bukavu and 40km from the South Kivu's airport, security sources told news agency AFP.
A spokesperson for the Congo River Alliance (known by its French acronym AFC), an alliance of rebel groups including the M23, suggested its fighters could take their battle to Bukavu.
Lawrence Kanyuka responded to the arrests by the Congolese authorities of 84 army personnel for crimes such as killing civilians near Bukavu, saying: "If these crimes persist, we will take full responsibility to eradicate the threat at its source and protect our people".
Meanwhile, reports say that hundreds and thousands of refugees, who have fled the ongoing fighting, were being forced to return home by the M23.
The M23 has denied this allegation, but French broadcaster RFI reported that several large camps for displaced people have been dismantled and their inhabitants made to trek back to their villages in conflict zones.
Ocha, the UN's humanitarian agency, said the M23 had given displaced people in Goma 72 hours to return to home.
Mr Kanyuka said such reports were "propaganda" and that displaced people were returning voluntarily. The M23 "does not compel anyone to return without firm security guarantees", he said.
The M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights, while DR Congo's government says the rebels are seeking control of the eastern region's vast mineral wealth.
DR Congo and the UN accused Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23 - an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied.
But recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat.

Headline: Huge data price hike sparks anger in Nigeria
Author: Mansur Abubakar, BBC News, Abuja
Published Date: 2025-02-11T14:09:33.759Z
Text: Nigerians are expressing outrage over a big jump in the price of mobile data charged by some of the country's major phone networks.
MTN - Nigeria's largest operator - trebled the cost of one of its most popular weekly offers. Airtel has also increased its tariffs.
A price jump was expected as the telecoms regulatory body had approved an increase, but in an announcement three weeks ago it said it had capped it at 50%. The phone companies wanted to boost their revenue in order to cover rising costs.
Nigerians have been living through a long cost-of-living crisis with inflation rates not seen for three decades. Any increase in prices adds to the struggle for many to make ends meet.
In response to customer complaints, MTN said on X that the price adjustment was necessary to serve subscribers better.
"We apologize for any inconvenience caused,” the company added. Airtel is yet to comment.
Subscribers only realised what had happened when they went to buy data over the past few hours.
The BBC has contacted Airtel for more information on the changes.
Many comments on social media called out the increase saying that it could cut off a lot of people at a time when the economy is in turmoil.
One target for criticism has been the rise in MTN's 15GB weekly bundle from 2,000 naira ($1.33; £1.08) to 6,000 naira ($3.99).
"What sort of outrageous increase is that?... Just making sure the masses suffer more," one commenter on X said.
"Triple the amount? The end time is near," another wrote.
Subscribers are also complaining that MTN's 1GB bundle has more than doubled in price and Airtel has trebled the cost of a similar offer.
People who use Globacom - the third largest network - say they have not been affected by increases.
The Nigeria Communications Commission, which regulates the telecom companies, is yet to react to the price rises which in some cases appear to exceed the cap that it had recommended.
Digital content creator Mubarak Uniquepikin told the BBC that the tariff hike could have a major impact for businesses that depend on being online.
"The economy is already comatose and for this to come in now when a lot of people can't rent shops and have taken their business online is bad," he said.
"Many young people already find it difficult to buy data and this would definitely make it worse for them."
Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation. A rise in inflation caused by the war in Ukraine was exacerbated when in 2023 President Bola Tinubu's government dropped the fuel subsidy.
The authorities also followed a policy of currency devaluation.
Both measures were intended to restore long-term stability, but in the meantime many people have suffered.

Headline: Detained Ugandan politician starts hunger strike
Author: Swaibu Ibrahim, BBC News, Kampala
Published Date: 2025-02-11T12:41:53.050Z
Text: Detained Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye has begun a hunger strike as his time spent in detention awaiting trial nears three months.
Besigye, 68, was charged in a military court with possession of pistols and attempting to purchase weapons abroad - accusations which he denies.
On Tuesday, an aide from Besigye's political movement, the People's Front for Freedom (PFF), told the BBC: "We believe he is protesting because he should not still be in prison - he should be home."
Besigye's trial was initially postponed until January - it is now unclear when the court case will begin.
Besigye used to be a personal doctor for Uganda's longtime president, Yoweri Museveni, but went on to become an opposition leader.
He has contested and lost four presidential elections against Museveni, who has been in power since 1986. The veteran opposition figure has previously accused the Ugandan authorities of political persecution.
He has been less active in politics in recent years, and did not contest the 2021 election.
However, Besigye returned to the headlines last month after he was dramatically abducted while visiting Kenya and forcibly taken to Uganda.
The detention sparked widespread condemnation and fears of a clandestine exchange of intelligence between the two neighbours.
Besigye was then charged along with an aide, Obeid Lutale. Mr Lutale also denied the charges.
In a landmark ruling last month, Uganda's Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional for military courts to try civilians, ordering the transfer of all such cases to civilian courts.
The move angered President Museveni, who dismissed it as "a wrong decision" and vowed to challenge the ruling.
Besigye has had various other run-ins with the law.
On Tuesday, the opposition politician was expected to appear before a civilian court for a hearing on a 2022 case in which he is accused of holding an unlawful demonstration. However, he did not attend the hearing, citing health reasons.
In 2005, Besigye was arrested while returning from a political rally ahead of the 2006 presidential polls and charged with treason. The charges were thrown out by the courts.
He was also charged with rape in a separate case. The charges were later dropped. He said all the allegations were part of a campaign of political persecution.
Museveni has defended the use of military courts to try civilians.
He said any crime involving a gun was dealt with in a military court to ensure the country's stability as civilian courts took too long to deal with cases.
Opposition parties have frequently complained about restrictions on political activities, alleging that Museveni fears political competition.
Museveni's supporters deny the allegation, and say he has maintained stability during his rule of almost 40 years.

Headline: South Sudan president sacks top leaders and spy chief
Author: Nichola Mandil, BBC News, Juba
Published Date: 2025-02-11T10:46:33.983Z
Text: South Sudan's President Salva Kiir has sacked two of his vice-presidents, the country's spy chief and other senior officials.
The dismissals were announced in a series of presidential decrees read on the state broadcaster. No reasons were given for the move.
South Sudan has five vice-presidents as part of a 2018 peace agreement to end a civil war.
The oil-rich nation became the world's newest country in 2011 after seceding from Sudan - but it was then engulfed by civil war after Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar fell out. The 2018 power-sharing agreement has been fraught with problems.
One of the vice-president removed from office is James Wani Igga, a veteran politician and general, who has been in the position since 2013 and has been the deputy chair of SPLM, the party of the president.
The other is Hussein Abdelbagi Akol, from an opposition alliance (SSOA) which is not part of the main opposition movement (SPLM-In Opposition) of First Vice-President Riek Machar.
Akol has been appointed the minister for agriculture, replacing Josephine Joseph Lagu from the same SSOA alliance who now becomes a vice-president.
Benjamin Bol Mel, who was sanctioned by the US in 2017 for alleged corruption, has been appointed to replace Igga as vice-president.
Mel, previously a special presidential envoy for special programmes, has been the subject of speculation that he was being fronted as a potential successor of Kiir.
The president has not appointed replacements for the health minister and the governor of the south-western state of Western Equatoria, who are both from Machar's party.
He has also not appointed a substantive replacement for the sacked spy chief, Akec Tong Aleu, who had only served four months after having been appointed in October.
The 2018 peace deal gives the president prerogative to appoint and dismiss government officials at both national and state level.
He can only appoint and dismiss officials who belong to other political parties with the consent of the leadership of those parties.
It is not clear whether the dismissal of Western Equatoria governor and the health minister were recommended by their party leader, Machar. The SPLM-In Opposition has not commented on the matter.
South Sudan has not conducted an election since independence.
The first nationwide vote was scheduled to take place in 2015, but the election could not go ahead due to the conflict that erupted in December 2013.
It was then supposed to happen in 2022, but polls were postponed for two years and were due two months ago.
The vote was postponed again, and the country's leadership said the election will now take place in December 2026.

Headline: Why some Ghanaians are fighting in insurgency-hit Burkina Faso
Author: Ed Butler, BBC World Service, Reporting fromTamale, Ghana
Published Date: 2025-02-11T02:15:30.857Z
Text: Three Ghanaians have told the BBC of their involvement in the fighting between Islamist insurgents and the military in neighbouring Burkina Faso, describing scenes of sometimes indiscriminate violence and bloody battles.
"We are always with the dead. In some battles, I've seen 40, 50 or 100 dead people," one of the men told the BBC.
The three, all in their late thirties or early forties, said they had fought in Burkina Faso multiple times since 2018. They crossed the porous 550km-long (340-mile) border between the two countries, without being detected by the security forces.
They denied being primarily motivated by religion or being trained by the jihadists, saying they went to fight to defend civilian communities with whom they had strong family and ethnic ties.
"My elder brother, his wife and children were all killed by the [Burkinabe] army. It pains me a lot. The military came to their community in the forest. They killed all of them, a whole household, including 29 people," one of the men said.
But another of the men did articulate religious zeal, saying: "If you die while fighting with the jihadists, then you are driving to jannah (an Islamic word for paradise), on the path of the righteous."
Challenged over whether they had taken part in civilian attacks, the men were divided.
One denied doing so, but another conceded that he did.
"Some local people support the military in attacking us, that's why we have to kill them too," he said.
"You know... I'm not happy to fight like this. The number of people we kill, the people the military kill, it's very bad. But this fight has entered our blood," he added.
All three spoke on condition of anonymity.
The BBC was unable to confirm their claims but they showed us pictures of weapons, described the location of recent conflicts and named jihadist commanders in Burkina Faso.
The BBC was put in touch with the men through contacts at cattle markets in northern Ghana, where jihadist groups are alleged to be recruiting fighters.
In 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.
And the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank, in a report released last July, said the jihadists had "minimal success" recruiting in Ghana.
However, the men offered a different perspective, telling the BBC, in claims that could not be verified, that people from "all parts of Ghana" and from "many" ethnic groups were joining the insurgency in Burkina Faso.
"Some are fighting for jihad. Some are doing it for business," one of them said.
The financial incentive comes in the form of the plentiful livestock that the jihadists steal from communities driven out of their villages.
"When we attack a community, we take their animals: sometimes 50, sometimes 100," the BBC was told by one of the men.
The cattle are allegedly brought to northern Ghana, and sold at markets.
The trafficking across the border was confirmed to the BBC by cattle dealers.
It is thought to have become a major income stream for groups like Jama'at Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate that is the most active jihadist group in Burkina Faso. It also operates in Niger and Mali.
The West African region was described by the UN last year as the epicentre of global jihadist violence.
Aid agencies say that over the last decade some two-million people have been displaced by the insurgency in Burkina Faso and tens of thousands killed.
Ninpoa Nasuri is one of the thousands who have fled to Ghana to escape the violence.
She told the BBC her husband was killed in front of her in 2024 during a raid on their village in eastern Burkina Faso by fighters from JNIM.
"They grabbed the men, and they beat them to death. My husband was a farmer. He had nothing to do with the government militia or the conflict," she told the BBC.
Other refugees described similar acts of violence by the Burkinabe military.
"Some of the people they were killing were aged 80, aged 90. These people can't hold a gun, can't fight with anybody. They killed them for no reason," Saafiya Karim said.
Ghana has so far remained largely untouched by the insurgency, although some attacks have taken place in neighbouring Togo and Ivory Coast.
In a recent statement to Ghanaian journalist Mohammed Eliasu Tanko, a man calling himself a representative of JNIM said the group had no interest in launching attacks in Ghana.
"They (JNIM fighters) are not allowed to take any action against Ghana. This is a clear and certain statement. JNIM do not seek war against Ghana," the man, known as Ansari, said in the statement, which the BBC has seen.
However an upsurge in communal violence in one part of northern Ghana has raised concerns that the jihadists are trying to exploit the conflict to their advantage.
The town of Bawku is embroiled in a decades-long struggle between different ethnic groups for control of the local chieftaincy. More than 100 people are thought to have been killed in clashes since fighting intensified in last October.
"The evening in Bawku is always [one of] gunshots and fierce exchanges. People use AK47s, M16s, all kinds of automatic rifles," a resident told the BBC.
JNIM smugglers are accused of selling weapons to both sides.
"We understand they are supplying weapons that they have taken from the military in Burkina Faso. They do this by relying on the trucks that travel up to Niger and back carrying onions. They hide the weapons inside those trucks," Tanko told the BBC.
"One intelligence officer confirmed to me this was the new way they are bringing firearms in. And the Ghanaian security are ill-equipped to be able to detect these vehicles coming through, putting Ghana in a very critical situation," he added.
Ghana's Defence Minister Edward Omane Boamah did not respond to a BBC request for comment.
President John Mahama, who took office in January after winning December's presidential election, visited Bawku last month in an effort to promote peace between the rival groups. However, gunfights continue to be reported.
Ghana's governing party spokesman Sammy Gyamfi told the BBC that ending the violence in Bawku was the government's "number one priority".
"The violence is already spreading and if care is not taken it's likely that insurgents from the wider region can take advantage of this conflict," he said.
The three men the BBC spoke to said they did not rule out the possibility of the insurgency spreading.
"This thing can go to any place, or to any country. It didn't exist in Togo but now the attacks are happening there. If they can go to Togo, they can get to Ghana. This thing is strong, it's powerful," one of them said.
But another of the men took a cynical perspective, saying the insurgents in Burkina Faso were no longer waging an "Islamic struggle".
"They just kill the people, and steal their livestock. What is happening is not jihad and so I do not like it," he said.

Headline: South Africa mourns pioneering female nuclear scientist
Author: Danai Nesta Kupemba, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-10T16:36:54.981Z
Text: South Africa's first black female nuclear scientist, Senamile Masango, a trailblazer who set out to inspire young women, has died aged 37, the government has confirmed.
Ms Masango, dubbed "the queen of science" by some in South Africa, passed away on Sunday. The cause of her death is unknown.
Headstrong and ambitious, she "was a beacon of hope for many young people, especially women", a statement from Deputy President Paul Mashatile said.
Despite her success she said she faced discrimination as a black woman as she constantly had to prove that she knew what she was talking about.
Nevertheless, her unwavering determination earned her deep respect in her field.
Ms Masango was the first African woman to join an African-led team conducting experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory.
"Masango's tireless efforts to promote science education and empowerment, particularly among women and disadvantaged communities, will be deeply missed," a statement from South Africa's Department of Science, Technology and Innovation said.
Born in 1987 in the rural village of Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, the historical seat of the Zulu monarchy, Ms Masango's mother was a princess in the royal family, and her father was a prominent figure.
She grew up in a polygamous family, with her mother being the youngest of three wives.
It was a challenging family set-up, she told local newspaper Sowetan Live, but she learned how to stand up for herself.
Her parents quickly recognised her early passion for learning and encouraged her to read extensively.
At 11, her geography teacher spoke about astronauts, sparking a lifelong interest in science.
"I was so fascinated to learn that there are people who travel to space - leave this dimension - and go to the moon," she told Global Citizen, an organisation dedicated to ending extreme poverty.
"That's when I fell in love with science."
Ms Masango enrolled at the University of Zululand at 16 to study physics, but after becoming pregnant and failing some modules, she had to drop out.
With her family's support, she returned to complete her degree and later earned an MSc in nuclear physics at the University of the Western Cape, graduating with distinction.
Tragically, her daughter died in a car crash aged seven.
Beyond her academic accomplishments, Ms Masango established a foundation dedicated to encouraging young women to pursue science.
"Girls are discouraged at an early age from taking science subjects; it is the root cause of the lack of women in the nuclear space," she said.
Her remarkable achievements included being named one of South Africa's most successful black women scientists under 35 in 2019 and earning a spot on the Mail & Guardian's 200 Young South Africans in Science and Technology list.
In 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community.
But throughout her career, Ms Masango faced misogynoir - the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender.
"The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think!"
"There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth," she said.
Yet, she persevered, using her journey to help inspire a new generation to pursue science fearlessly and boldly.

Headline: Sudan army plans new government as it advances in capital
Author: Basillioh Rukanga, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-10T07:55:36.853Z
Text: The Sudanese military has called for diplomatic support for a new government that it says it wants to form after it recaptures the capital, Khartoum, from rival forces.
The Sudanese army has been regaining control of areas in the city previously held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in recent weeks.
Army leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan told a meeting of politicians who back the army over the weekend that he would form a "technocratic" wartime government with a prime minister.
He insisted there would be no negotiations with the RSF. The two sides have been fighting for approaching two years - a conflict that has forced 12 million from their homes and left many starving.
Gen Burhan also said there would be a new constitution prior to the formation of the transitional government.
"We can call it a caretaker government, a wartime government, but it's a government that will help us complete what remains of our military objectives, which is freeing Sudan from these rebels," he said on Saturday.
A statement by the foreign ministry on Sunday called on "the international community, particularly the United Nations, the African Union, and the Arab League, to support the roadmap presented by the state as a national consensus for establishing peace and stability and completing the tasks of the transition".
The army and the RSF, which once worked together, have since been involved in a vicious power struggle.
The ongoing war, in which tens of thousands have been killed, broke out in April 2023 after Gen Burhan and RSF head Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo fell out over the future shape of the government.
The conflict has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, according to international aid agencies.
Both the army and the RSF have been accused of committing grave atrocities against civilians, with their leaders being sanctioned by the US. In addition, the RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide in the Darfur area.
Both forces deny the accusations.
In recent weeks, the army has had huge victories against the RSF in the capital and Gezira state.
The paramilitary force has retreated from these areas overpowered by the army's expanded air power as well as ground support by allied militias.
It however still controls most of the west of the country, where intense conflict has been going on as it seeks to consolidate its control of the Darfur region.

Headline: The DR Congo rebel leader whose fighters have created turmoil
Author: Wedaeli Chibelushi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-10T02:46:28.239Z
Text: The Democratic Republic of Congo is in turmoil - fighters from the notorious M23 rebel group have been surging through the country's east, battling the national army and capturing key places as they go.
In just a fortnight, thousands of people are said to have been killed and the fighting has sparked an ominous war of words between DR Congo and its neighbour, Rwanda.
So how did DR Congo - the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa - get here?
The origins of this complex conflict can be understood through the story of one man - M23 leader Sultani Makenga, who is the subject of various war crime allegations.
He is sanctioned by the US of using child soldiers, which he has denied. The UN has accused him of being responsible for sexual violence.
To go back through Makenga's life so far is to look into decades of warfare, intermittent foreign intervention and the persistent lure of DR Congo's rich mineral resources.
His life began on Christmas Day in 1973, when he was born in the lush Congolese town of Masisi.
Raised by parents of the Tutsi ethnic group, Makenga quit school at the age of 17 to join a Tutsi rebel outfit across the border in Rwanda.
This group, named the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), were demanding greater Tutsi representation in Rwanda's government, which at the time was dominated by politicians from the Hutu majority.
They also wanted the hundreds and thousands of Tutsi refugees who had been forced from the country by ethnic violence to be able to return home.
For four years, Makenga and the RPF fought the Hutu-dominated army in Rwanda. Their battle was enmeshed with the 1994 genocide, when Hutu extremists killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
When looking back at this time in a rare 2013 interview, Makenga stated: "My life is war, my education is war, and my language is war... but I do respect peace."
The RPF gradually seized more and more land before marching into Rwanda's capital, Kigali, and overthrowing the extremist Hutu government - many of whom fled into what is now DR Congo.
With the RPF in power, Makenga was absorbed into the official Rwandan army and rose to the rank of sergeant and deputy platoon commander.
"He was very good at setting up ambushes," one of Makenga's fellow RPF fighters told the Rift Valley Institute non-profit research organisation.
His progress in the Rwandan army hit a ceiling however. The fact that he only had a basic education and spoke broken French and English was "an obstacle to his military career", the Rift Valley Institute said.
Makenga is also said - to this day - to be very reserved and to struggle with public speaking.
In 1997, he was part of the Rwanda-backed forces who ended up seizing power in DR Congo, ousting long-serving ruler Mobutu Sese Seko. In his place they installed veteran Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
However, Makenga began to clash with his superiors - he was arrested by the Rwandan authorities after refusing orders to return to Rwanda, a UN Security Council report said.
He was therefore imprisoned for several years on the island of Iwawa.
Meanwhile, relations between Kabila and Rwanda's new leaders deteriorated.
Rwanda had sought to crush the Hutu militiamen who were responsible for the genocide but had fled across the border in 1994. Rwanda's fear was that they could return and upset the country's hard-won stability.
But Kabila had failed to stop the militants from organising and he also started to force out Rwandan troops.
As a result, Rwanda invaded DR Congo in 1998. When Makenga was released from prison, he was appointed to serve as a commander on the front line with a Rwanda-backed rebel group.
Over the years, he gained a reputation for being highly strategic and skilled at commanding large groups of soldiers into battle.
After Rwandan troops crossed into DR Congo, there was a surge in discrimination against the Tutsi community. Kabila alleged that Tutsis supported the invasion, while other officials incited the public to attack members of the ethnic group.
Makenga - still in DR Congo - accused the Congolese leader of betraying Tutsi fighters, saying: "Kabila was a politician, while I am not. I am a soldier, and the language that I know is that of the gun."
Several neighbouring countries had been drawn into the conflict and a large UN military force was deployed to try to maintain order.
More than five million people are believed to have died in the war and its aftermath - mostly from starvation or disease.
The fighting officially ended in 2003 but Makenga continued to serve in armed groups opposed to the Congolese government.
In the spirit of reconciliation, Tutsi rebels like Makenga were eventually amalgamated into the Congolese government's armed forces, in a process called "mixage".
But the political sands in DR Congo are ever shifting - Makenga eventually defected from the army to join the rising M23 rebellion.
The M23 had become increasingly active in DR Congo's east, stating that they were fighting to protect Tutsi rights, and that the government had failed to honour a peace deal signed in 2009.
Makenga was elevated to the rank of an M23 general, then soon after, the top position.
In November 2012 he led the rebels in a brutal uprising, in which they captured the city of Goma, a major eastern city with a population of more than a million.
DR Congo and the UN accused Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23 - an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied. But recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat.
By 2012, Makenga and others in the M23 were facing serious war crimes allegations. The US imposed sanctions on him, saying he was responsible for "the recruitment of child soldiers, and campaigns of violence against civilians". Makenga said allegations that the M23 used child soldiers were "baseless".
Elsewhere, the UN said he had committed, and was responsible for, acts such as killing and maiming, sexual violence and abduction.
Along with asset freezes, Makenga was facing a bitter split within the M23. One side backed him as leader while the other backed his rival, Gen Bosco Ntaganda.
The Enough Project, a non-profit group working in DR Congo, said the two factions descended into a "full-fledged war" in 2013 and as a result, three soldiers and eight civilians died.
Makenga's side triumphed and Gen Ntaganda fled to Rwanda, where he surrendered to the US embassy.
Nicknamed the "Terminator" for his ruthlessness, Gen Ntaganda was eventually sentenced by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to 30 years for war crimes.
However, months after Makenga's triumph, another, larger threat appeared. The UN had deployed a 3,000-strong force with a mandate to support the Congolese military in reclaiming Goma, prompting the M23 to withdraw.
The rebel group was expelled from the country and Makenga fled to Uganda, a country which has also been accused of supporting the M23 - an allegation it denies.
Uganda received an extradition request for Makenga from DR Congo, but did not act on it.
Eight years passed. Dozens of other armed groups roamed the mineral-rich east, wreaking havoc, but the Congolese authorities were free of the most notorious militants.
That is, until 2021.
Makenga and his rebels took up arms again, capturing territory in North Kivu province.
Several ceasefires between the M23 and the Congolese authorities have failed, and last year a judge sentencing Makenga to death in absentia.
During the M23's latest advance, in which the rebels are said to be supported by thousands of Rwandan troops, Makenga has barely been seen in public.
He instead leaves the public speeches and statements to his spokesperson, and Corneille Nangaa, who heads an alliance of rebel groups including the M23.
But Makenga remains a key player, appearing to focus on strategy behind the scenes.
He has said his relentless fighting has been for his three children, "so that one day they will have a better future in this country".
"I shouldn't be seen as a man who doesn't want peace. I have a heart, a family, and people I care about," he said.
But millions of ordinary people are paying the price of this conflict and if he is captured by the Congolese forces, Makenga faces the death penalty.
Yet he is undeterred.
"I am willing to sacrifice everything, " he said.

Headline: Sam Nujoma, first president of Namibia, dies aged 95
Author: Thomas Mackintosh & Farouk Chothia, BBC News, London
Published Date: 2025-02-09T21:41:29.339Z
Text: The first president of independent Namibia, Sam Nujoma, has died at the age of 95 in the capital Windhoek, the country's current leader has announced.
Nujoma led the long fight for independence from South Africa in 1990 after helping found Namibia's liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s.
After independence, Nujoma became president in 1990 and led the country until 2005.
Nujoma had been hospitalised over the past three weeks with an illness from which he "could not recover", Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba said in a statement announcing the death with "utmost sorrow and sadness".
He "inspired us to rise to our feet and to become masters of this vast land of our ancestors," President Mbumba said.
He added: "Our founding father lived a long and consequential life during which he exceptionally served the people of his beloved country."
King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla had been "profoundly saddened" to learn of Nujoma's death.
In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, the King paid tribute to Nujoma's "lifelong commitment to freedom and democracy" and "immense" contribution to history.
Nujoma retired as head of state in 2005, but continued to lead the party before stepping down in 2007 as president of the ruling Swapo party after 47 years at the helm.
Many Namibians have reacted to his death with sadness, fondly remembering him as "father of the nation", says the BBC's Frauke Jensen in Namibia's capital, Windhoek.
A teary-eyed Mbumba visited Nujoma's home to offer condolences to his family, including his wife Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune, 91.
Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability after independence from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, in 1990.
Nujoma's policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy.
He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock.
Namibia's Vice-President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who is due to be inaugurated as president in March after leading Swapo to victory in elections, said his "visionary leadership and dedication to liberation and nation-building laid the foundation for our free, united nation".
African leaders have joined in paying tribute, with African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat describing Nujoma as "the epitome of courage, never wavering from his vision for a free Namibia and a unified Africa".
South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the former Namibian president was an "extraordinary freedom fighter" who played a leading role in not only his country's fight against colonialism, but also in the campaign that led to white-minority rule ending in South Africa in 1994.
"President Nujoma's leadership of a free Namibia laid the foundation for the solidarity and partnership our two countries share today - a partnership we will continue to deepen as neighbours and friends," Ramaphosa added.
Kenya's President William Ruto said Nujoma was a "visionary leader who dedicated his life to the liberation and development of his country".
Funeral details have not yet been announced.

Headline: Bodies of migrants found in Libya mass grave, authorities say
Author: Richard Kagoe, BBC News, Reporting fromNairobi, George Wright, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon
Published Date: 2025-02-09T18:56:32.463Z
Text: The bodies of at least 28 migrants have been recovered from a mass grave in a desert in south-east Libya, the country's attorney general said.
The grave was discovered north of Kufra, just days after another mass grave with 19 bodies was found on a farm in the same city.
Officials found the latest grave following a raid on a human trafficking site, where authorities freed 76 migrants who had been detained and tortured, the office of the attorney general posted on Facebook.
One Libyan and two foreigners have been arrested, it added.
"There was a gang whose members deliberately deprived illegal migrants of their freedom, tortured them and subjected them to cruel, humiliating and inhumane treatment," the statement said.
Images shared online - which the BBC has not independently verified - show police and volunteers digging in the sand before placing corpses in black bags.
The search in Kufra - more than 1,700 kilometres (1,056 miles) from Libya's capital Tripoli - is continuing.
The attorney general says the bodies recovered have been taken for autopsy, with investigators suspecting links to smuggling networks. Authorities are documenting the testimonies of survivors.
Last year, a mass grave containing the bodies of at least 65 migrants was found in the south-west of Libya. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) described it as "deeply shocking" at the time.
Since the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has become a key transit route for migrants risking dangerous desert and Mediterranean Sea crossings to reach Europe.
Unicef has said that in 2024 the number of people who died or went missing in the Mediterranean, trying to reach Europe, surpassed 2,200.

Headline: How Somalis see the 'Black Hawk Down' battle three decades on
Author: Abdishukri Haybe, BBC Somali
Published Date: 2025-02-09T12:41:41.783Z
Text: The expression Black Hawk Down, the title of a Hollywood film, has become shorthand for a 1993 US military disaster in Somalia.
Eighteen American soldiers lost their lives in the fighting that began on 3 October, but so did hundreds of Somalis.
As Netflix launches a documentary about those events, the BBC has spoken to some Somalis still scarred by what happened.
Despite being surrounded by the debris of an ongoing civil war, Mogadishu's residents in the early 1990s embraced the moments of serenity.
The warm Sunday sunshine and cooling ocean breeze made for the perfect opportunity for Binti Ali Wardhere, 24 at the time, to visit relatives with her mother.
"That day was calm," she remembers.
But like everyone else in the city she was unaware that the Americans were getting ready to attack warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed – and what happened would change her life forever.
The US had deployed soldiers to Somalia in 1992. They were there to support a UN mission that offered humanitarian assistance to alleviate a famine – in part caused by the collapse of the central government.
But after Aideed was blamed for being behind the killing of 24 UN peacekeepers in June 1993, he became a focus of military action.
This included a US raid in July in which at least 70 Somalis died, marking a turning-point in the way the Americans were viewed. It also led to the deployment of elite US Rangers.
On 3 October, the US got intelligence that Aideed would be at a meeting with his top officials at a hotel. The Americans launched an airborne operation that was supposed to take 90 minutes – in the end it lasted 17 hours.
For Binti, the first sign that something unusual was happening was the sound of deafening explosions that started just after 15:30 local time.
Mogadishu residents had become accustomed to the sound of fighting, but there was something about the magnitude of these blasts and the shockwaves they caused that felt abnormal.
People began fleeing in all directions.
Determined to understand what was happening, Binti climbed to the rooftop of her relative's house. From there, she saw that the fighting was taking place in her own neighbourhood.
Two US Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, one at 16:20 and the other at 16:40. The taskforce was surrounded and then a rescue mission began.
Fearing for her family, Binti ran for home.
"To this day, I still see the bodies scattered in the streets," she says.
Binti reached her house just after 18:00 and was relieved to find everyone safe.
The fighting eased a little bit, bringing a brief moment of calm.
She served tea as her husband discussed the war with a neighbour. But he did not have a chance to taste the tea as a shell hit their house.
Binti felt her hand get partially severed. She fell to the ground, a woman collapsed on top of her.
"There was hot water running over my head. I thought to myself: 'Who opened the water pipe?'"
She then realised it was the blood of the person on top of her, who had died. It was Binti's neighbour who had come to their house for safety.
That night, Binti also lost her husband, Mohamed Aden, and two sons - 14-year-old Abdulkadir Mohamed and 13-year-old Abdurahman Mohamed.
Four of her other children, along with her brother, who had been staying with them, were injured. Her brother later succumbed to his injuries.
Ifrah, who was just four years old at the time, was permanently blinded.
Binti's eldest son, now a father himself, continues to struggle with mental health issues. To this day, the sight or sound of an aeroplane sends him into hiding.
He did not know it on that quiet Sunday morning, but prominent cameraman Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, also known as Ahmed Five, was to play a major role in how the events were seen.
Twenty-nine at the time, he had already documented clan wars, famine and the chaotic events of Mogadishu and its suburbs.
That day, he was not thinking about work when the explosions rattled the air.
The sounds of helicopter gunfire and heavy machine guns signalled something more intense than the crackle of AK-47 that he normally heard.
Ahmed always carried his camera, knowing that in Mogadishu anything could happen at any moment. He instinctively began documenting the unfolding chaos and headed towards the heart of the battle.
"Although this situation was completely different from the ones I had worked in before, I still decided to record these events and take on that responsibility," he tells the BBC.
The closest event he had ever witnessed to this was the July raid which galvanised anti-American sentiment and set the stage for October's confrontation.
On the first day, he filmed some of the fighting between the US soldiers and the Somalis.
Then on the second day, he was led to a house where US pilot Michael Durant was being held.
Mr Durant had been flying the second Black Hawk that had come down after it was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. After crashing, his three crew members were killed in the fighting along with two others who had gone to rescue them.
"It was a huge gun battle. They say that 25 Somalis were killed by gunfire at crash site two, so that gives you some insight into how much shooting was going on," Mr Durant later told the BBC.
He was saved when a gunman recognised that the pilot might have value as a prisoner.
Ahmed then filmed the nervous and battered American who had several scars on his face. He can be seen confirming his identity while breathing heavily and glancing to his side at an interrogator, who is out of shot.
Until that point, neither the US nor Aideed knew Mr Durant was being held, Ahmed says.
"I handed the videotapes to a UN plane that flew daily from Mogadishu to Nairobi [in neighbouring Kenya].
"The first report of the Mogadishu battle to reach the world was from the footage I recorded. At the time, I was working as a freelancer for CNN."
The images captured by Ahmed made headlines around the world.
They also fed into the debate about US combat policy in the African continent, which shifted after the fighting in Mogadishu.
"This is something I take pride in - though at the time, I didn't anticipate its impact," Ahmed says.
Within six months, the US had withdrawn its forces from Somalia. The perceived failure of the Somali mission made the US wary of intervening in subsequent African crises.
The third of October started as a day of celebration in Saida Omar Mohamud's household as that morning she gave birth to a baby girl.
Relatives and neighbours gathered at her home to congratulate her, as the family prepared for a traditional name-giving ceremony.
But the mood shifted once the fighting started.
Chaos erupted as the first helicopter crashed in front of Saida's home.
Within moments, she remembers at least 10 US soldiers storming into the house.
They gathered everyone into the living room, ordering them not to move and turned it into an impromptu field hospital.
The family watched in shock as wounded soldiers were laid on their dining table, receiving emergency medical treatment.
"Although they were afraid, they made us scared as well. They turned our house into a stronghold," Saida says.
As well as her own searing memories, Saida left a permanent reminder of that day with what she decided to call her daughter,
As Somalis say, "no name is given without a reason" and so Saida's little girl is now known as Amina Rangers.
The Netflix documentary features "raw, immersive storytelling with first-person interviews from both sides of the Battle of Mogadishu", according to the publicity. It sheds light on the horrors experienced by Somalis like Binti during the conflict.
"This time, Somalis were given the opportunity to share their account of events. It is crucial that both sides of the story are always told," Ahmed Five says.
But for Binti Ali, simply telling the story is not enough.
She lost loved ones in the war. Yet she feels the devastation inflicted on Somali families like hers remains largely unacknowledged.
"It was the Americans who destroyed my house, killed my husband, my two sons, and my brother, and left my family in lasting misery," she says, her voice breaking.
"At the very least, they must admit what they have done and compensate us."

Headline: Sam Nujoma: The revolutionary leader who liberated Namibia
Author: Wycliffe Muia in Nairobi & Frauke Jensen in Windhoek, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-09T04:44:41.003Z
Text: Revered as "father of the nation" and the icon of Namibia's liberation struggle, Sam Nujoma lived up to these expectations in more ways than one.
His warm, broad smile and easy-going manner made him likeable and accessible.
Whether donning a tracksuit to join a fun-run along Windhoek's Independence Avenue, or insisting his driver hang back from official motorcades, he aimed to be a man of the people.
Now, four decades after leading Namibia through a bitter guerrilla war against South Africa's racist apartheid government and on to independence, Nujoma has died aged 95.
He died on Saturday after being in hospital for three weeks due to "ill health", President Nangolo Mbumba announced in a statement, adding that the death had "shaken" the country.
The giant who shaped Namibia's national identity leaves a void few can hope to fill.
Namibia, previously called South West Africa, suffered decades of looting and colonial violence at the hands of Europeans who had flocked to the country around the turn of the 20th Century.
Starting in 1904, German colonisers killed tens of thousands of Namibians in what has been dubbed the world's "forgotten genocide". German officers used black Africans as guinea pigs for horrific crimes later repeated by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
Namibia was under German occupation from 1884 until 1915, when Germany lost its colony in World War One.
Namibia then fell under the rule of white South Africa, which extended its racist laws to the country, denying black Namibians any political rights, as well as restricting social and economic freedoms.
The introduction of sweeping apartheid legislation led to a guerrilla war of independence breaking out in 1966.
By this stage, Nujoma was already involved in the fight against white-minority rule.
The self-confessed "elder son of a peasant family" from the northern village of Etunda had a modest start in life, with little more than a primary school education.
Married to Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune with whom he had four children, and working on a railway, he held a deep passion for politics and yearned to see his people free from the injustice and indignity of colonialism.
Inspiration came in the stories of early Namibian resistance leaders, such as Hendrik Witbooi, who fought against the Germans in the 1880s.
By 1959, Nujoma had become the head of the Owamboland Peoples organisation, the independence movement that was a forerunner to Swapo.
A year later, aged 30, Nujoma was forced into exile. With no passport, he used his cunning to adopt different personas and blagged his way onto trains and planes - ending up in Zambia and Tanzania before heading to West Africa.
With the help of Liberian authorities who were early backers of black Namibians' push for independence, Nujoma flew to New York and petitioned the UN to help grant Namibia its independence - but South Africa refused.
Nujoma was branded a "Marxist terrorist" by South Africa's white leaders for leading forces that fought alongside the anti-apartheid movement, posing a formidable challenge to the oppressive regimes in several southern African countries.
With support from Cuban troops who were fighting in neighbouring Angola, Swapo guerrillas were able to attack South African bases in Namibia.
Returning from exile, Nujoma was swiftly rearrested by the South African authorities and deported to Zambia six years later.
"We knew that only military force and mass political mobilisation backed by the support of the people would force South Africa out of Namibia," Nujoma narrated in his autobiography Where Others Wavered, which was published in 2001.
He led Swapo forces from exile, before returning to the country in 1989, a year after South Africa had agreed to Namibian independence.
South Africa was becoming more isolated internationally and the cost of military intervention was increasing. Namibia finally gained independence in 1990 after almost 25 years of warfare.
In Namibia's first democratic elections in 1990, Swapo won a huge majority and Nujoma became the country's first president.
Nujoma was especially concerned with the plight of children, introducing maintenance payments obliging absent fathers to contribute to the cost of raising their offspring.
He also championed the advancement of women, helping to change traditional patriarchal practices that forced widows out of the family home once their husband died.
He also appeared keen to preserve stability to ensure development efforts were supported by international donors.
Nujoma was re-elected for two more terms in 1994 and 1999 - when he was criticised for having the constitution changed so that he could stand for a third term in office.
When criticised for his style of government or questioned about his party's political past, the wide smile could turn sour. Pointing a finger at whoever dared openly question or criticise, he would sometimes lose his countenance and hurl insults.
He openly abhorred same-sex relationships, but never went as far as changing the constitution or the law to make them illegal.
Nujoma always valued his close friendship with Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, yet as Namibia's president he mostly steered clear of open aggression against those who did not agree with him.
However through the Swapo machinery, he would quite happily exert pressure on the common man to tow the party line and allow the party to delve into government coffers to ensure continued rule.
Nujoma's cabinet was often dictated to rather than reaching decisions by joint debate, such was his power.
When he stepped down as president in 2005 and as Swapo president in 2007 after serving as the party leader for 47 years – he handed power to his successor, Hifikepunye Pohamba.
Even after leaving office, Nujoma still wielded considerable power over the party and government from behind the scenes.
Yet his achievements while in office are undeniable, with many Namibians praising him for leading the country's smooth transition to democratic rule.
Since independence, Namibia has been seen as one of Africa's success stories, with regular peaceful and democratic elections.
And, despite the humiliations and injustices heaped upon black Namibians by white colonisers, Nujoma upheld the country's constitution in safeguarding the basic rights of all Namibians whatever their ethnicity.
The policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other economic sectors.
Nujoma's ability to unify a nation of three million people – across 10 ethnic and linguistic communities – won him many admirers.
In recognition of his towering achievement, the Namibian parliament granted him the official status of "Founding Father of Namibia" in 2005. Numerous international honours included the Lenin Peace Prize, the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize and the Ho Chi Minh Peace Prize.
In his latter years, Nujoma disappeared from the limelight, preferring instead to spend time with his large family.
He is remembered for his easy charm and unwavering conviction - father not just to a family but a whole nation.

Headline: African summit urges immediate DR Congo ceasefire
Author: Sammy Awami, BBC News, Reporting fromDar es Salaam, Jaroslav Lukiv, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon
Published Date: 2025-02-08T20:20:12.832Z
Text: Leaders from east and southern Africa have called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end the deadly fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
At a crisis summit in Tanzania, the Southern African Development Community and East African Community (EAC) blocs urged all warring parties to hold peace talks within five days, including with the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.
The rebels - fighting government forces - have seized vast swathes of land in the eastern DR Congo, including the city of Goma. Their push towards Bukavu has raised fears of a wider regional war.
As part of their talks, army chiefs have also been told to draw up a security plan for Goma and surrounding areas.
The latest UN figures suggest 2,900 people have been killed since early January, as a result of the hostilities between M23 and armed forces of the DR Congo.
Around 700,000 are estimated to have been displaced and thousands more injured.
Saturday's gathering in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's biggest city, brought together heads of state and government representatives to try to resolve the worsening security and humanitarian situation.
"The summit emphasises that political and diplomatic engagement is the most sustainable solution to the conflict," said the follow-up communique.
It also demanded the reopening of Goma airport and other key routes to facilitate humanitarian aid, as well as the withdrawal of uninvited foreign armed forces from Congolese territory.
M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights while DR Congo's government says the Rwanda-backed rebels are seeking control of the eastern region's vast mineral wealth.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame - who was at the summit - has repeatedly denied any involvement in supporting the rebels.
But, as reported last month by the BBC's Ian Wafula, a group of UN experts maintains the Rwandan army is in "de facto control of M23 operations" - detailing how M23 recruits are trained under Rwandan supervision and supported by high-tech Rwandan weaponry.
Following the summit, Kagame posted on Facebook, accusing the DR Congo of "mounting a security problem against our country".
The DR Congo's President, Félix Tshisekedi, opted to appear at the summit via video link. Prime Minister Judith Suminwa was there in person.
There was no immediate response from Suminwa or the Congolese delegation to the joint communique.
Kenyan President William Ruto, the current EAC chairperson, stressed military solutions alone could not resolve the crisis.
"We must resist the temptation to think that we can somehow shoot or bombard our way into a solution in the face of such a complex situation," he said.
Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan underscored a "collective responsibility" of regional leaders to end the conflict, saying "history will judge us harshly if we remain still and watch the situation worsen day by day".
The ongoing conflict dates back to the 1990s, but has rapidly escalated in recent weeks.
The DR Congo is so vast - two-thirds the size of Western Europe - that it is a member of both the East and Southern African blocs.

Text: The seizure by M23 rebels of vast tracts of land in the mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has triggered a humanitarian and diplomatic crisis, involving several neighbouring countries.
An alarming number of African armies already have troops deployed in the conflict zone, which has a long history of outside interference.
The DR Congo is so vast - two-thirds the size of Western Europe - that it is a member of both the East and Southern African blocs.
The two regional groupings are joining forces to hold an emergency summit on Saturday to try and end the fighting.
So, who are the main players and what do they want?
First and foremost is the Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi. He wants to regain territory lost to the rebels, including the largest eastern town of Goma, and to prevent them from seizing more.
He blames Rwandan leader Paul Kagame for backing the M23 with weapons and troops, accusing Kigali of invading Congolese territory with the aim of looting the country's mineral wealth and orchestrating regime change.
The case that Rwanda is supporting the M23 offensive is based on evidence presented in a UN report and broadly accepted by many African and Western governments, who have demanded that Kagame withdraw his forces.
However, to Tshisikedi's frustration, none have matched their rhetoric with action and responded to Kinshasa's calls for sanctions and other tough measures.
The Congolese leader is also worried about keeping his seat.
"I think the political survival of his government is at stake," said Jason Stearns, a former UN investigator in DR Congo and currently a professor at Simon Fraser University.
There is concern that the M23 campaign might embolden internal opposition forces or trigger a coup in his army, which has a reputation for being fragmented and undermined by corruption.
In this conflict, Rwanda's long-time leader Kagame is the centre of attention, but he's practised at deflecting it.
He has a long history of military intervention inside DR Congo linked to the aftermath of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Rwanda does not admit to providing military support to the M23, but repeatedly insists it will do anything necessary to defend itself.
Kagame maintains that Rwanda's priority is to destroy an armed group formed by the Hutu genocide perpetrators, who massacred Rwandan Tutsis and then fled to what is now eastern DR Congo.
He has accused DR Congo's army of joining forces with them and others to not only slaughter Congolese Tutsis - who the M23 claims to be fighting to protect - but to threaten Rwanda.
At a diplomatic level, Rwanda wants confirmation of its narrative – that the conflict is a Congolese problem, and Kigali is simply defending its borders against the spill-over of a civil war.
It's demanding that Kinshasa negotiate directly with the M23, which it refuses to do.
But what it's really after, said Mr Stearns, is "to maintain a sphere of influence in the eastern DR Congo".
Rwanda has economic as well as security interests.
Kigali denies UN evidence that it smuggles vast amounts of gold and other metals out of eastern DR Congo and sells them as its own. But access to DR Congo's mineral wealth has been a driver of conflict in the region for decades.
There are others this time around, not least the personal animosity between Kagame and Tshisekedi.
"Kagame wants to teach Tshisekedi a lesson about who's the strong guy on the block," said Richard Moncrieff, who monitors Africa's Great Lakes region for the International Crisis Group (ICG).
The Rwandans are "just going to keep fighting until he makes concessions and…gives them fairly free rein in [the eastern province of] North Kivu," he added.
Rwanda sees Burundi's army as another security threat in eastern DR Congo.
The nation that borders both Rwanda and DR Congo has had thousands of soldiers there for years. They went to hunt down Burundian rebels but are now supporting Kinshasa's army in battles against the M23.
Relations between Rwanda and Burundi are hostile. The two countries have a similar ethnic make-up but unlike Rwanda, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi. Both countries have accused each other of trying to overthrow their respective governments.
Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye has posted a strongly-worded warning on social media.
"If Rwanda continues to make conquests," he wrote, "I know that war will even arrive in Burundi… One day he [Kagame] wants to come to Burundi - we're not going to accept that. The war will spread."
The threat would increase if the M23 continues its advance from Goma into the province of South Kivu closer to Burundi's border, which is where its forces are stationed.
"What Burundi is seeking here is regime survival," said Mr Stearns.
"Burundi is worried that if Rwandan troops… extend their influence into South Kivu that could destabilize the government in Bujumbura. What's at stake here is stopping this rebellion before it gets too close to home."
Some fear a repeat of the two wars that engulfed the region in the late 1990s, which drew in nine different countries and reportedly led to millions of deaths.
This time, direct clashes between the two armies could extend the DR Congo's conflict beyond its borders.
Uganda is not directly involved, but it also has troops in eastern DR Congo.
They are helping the Congolese government with a different security threat – hunting down militants with Ugandan origins who are connected to the Islamic State group.
But Uganda's role is confusing – it's working with the Congolese, while also allegedly providing at least complicit support to the M23. UN experts report that it has allowed them to use Ugandan territory as a rear base and supply route.
Kampala strongly denies that. But it has responded to the M23 offensive by putting its troops in a "forward defensive posture," to prevent other armed groups from exploiting the crisis, it has said.
Local residents have reported seeing Ugandan soldiers moving towards the conflict zone, heightening fears of a regional escalation.
Like Rwanda, Uganda has entered eastern DR Congo in the past claiming to be protecting its borders. But it's also accused of looting natural resources, especially gold.
Analysts expect it to safeguard its economic interests while keeping an eye on the Rwandans.
"It's very clear that Uganda wants to retain its own influence in eastern DR Congo and not be pushed out by its rival in Rwanda," says the ICG's Mr Moncrieff.
South Africa has contributed most of the troops to a Southern African regional force fighting alongside the Congolese army and has suffered heavy losses.
But it's also been thrust into the headlines because of an astonishingly vitriolic exchange between Kigali and Johannesburg.
The South Africans blamed the deaths of 14 of their soldiers on the Rwandan Defense Forces, which President Cyril Ramaphosa disparagingly referred to as the "RDF militia."
His defence minister claimed he'd warned Kagame that any further shooting would be taken as a declaration of war.
This infuriated the Rwandan president, who said that the account of their conversation was a "lie" and called the South Africans a "belligerent" force that must leave the DR Congo.
This is the sharpest end of a broad division between the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (Sadc).
The EAC supports Rwanda's call for direct talks between Kinshasa and the M23.
While Sadc condemns RDF attacks on its soldiers, including Tanzanian and Malawian troops, and has reaffirmed their commitment to DR Congo's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

Headline: Sudan army makes huge gains as it seeks to recapture war-torn capital
Author: Mohanad Hashim & Natasha Booty, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-07T17:59:55.895Z
Text: Residents of Sudan's capital Khartoum say the army has recaptured large parts of the city from RSF paramilitaries, marking its biggest victory in a year.
"Shrapnel and stray ammunition are falling on my neighbourhood," a doctor we are calling Mustafa tells the BBC. "The clashes these days are heavy".
Key sites recaptured by the army this week include the mint – where money is printed.
At the time of writing, the RSF still controls most of Khartoum proper. Whereas the army now holds the majority of territory across the wider tripartite capital - meaning Omdurman, Bahri and Khartoum.
But, after winning back near total control of the crucial state of Gezira, the army believes it now has the momentum to take the capital too, and break the RSF's almost two-year siege.
"Very soon there will be no rebels in Khartoum," announced army leader and de facto ruler Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Tuesday.
An end to this conflict cannot come fast enough.
Aid workers say people are starving across the country as a result of the war – in Khartoum alone more than 100,000 people are suffering from famine, according to UN-backed researchers.
Since war broke out almost two years ago between Gen Burhan and his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan "Hemedti" Dagalo who leads the RSF, 12 million people have been forced from their homes and tens of thousands of civilians have been butchered.
Sudan is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, agree international aid agencies.
They say both the army and the RSF are guilty of committing some of the gravest atrocities imaginable against innocent civilians, including that the RSF has carried out a genocide in Darfur.
Both forces deny the accusations.
The army has been jubilantly welcomed by many inhabitants of the areas it has recently recaptured, as the RSF has been widely accused of killing and raping civilians in Khartoum, as well as looting the homes of the many residents who have fled the city.
Reports of the army's advance have been dismissed by the RSF as "lies and rumours". They have made similar denials ahead of every retreat in recent weeks.
Analysts say the army's recent successes have been the result of enlisting more fighters and buying more weaponry. Winning back the besieged army headquarters was also a huge boon earlier this month.
The army's expulsion of the paramilitary group from the central city of Wad Madani in January was marred by allegations of summary executions and arbitrary retribution attacks on those perceived to be RSF informants or collaborators.
This will no doubt raise fears among some Khartoum residents that the same fate awaits them.
"When you open social media and you see all the killing, if you've committed something wrong you must be worried," Mustafa told the BBC.
"Some of them led fighters to people's homes. Others joined [the RSF] and stole property, terrorised people - even held women against their will [as sex slaves]. They did horrible things.
"Are they terrified of what is to come? Of course."
But sometimes there is a fine line between being seen as a collaborator, and the reality of survival in war.
"I am worried for my cousin," says Amir, who lives in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman, which lies just across the River Nile.
"He is not a collaborator or an informant - he often has to deal with these people [the RSF] because he's looking after his mother and his kids. Will he be slaughtered [by the army] or will he be left alone?"
For now, as the army approaches and Sudan's future hands in the balance, all that Mustafa and Amir can do is wait.

Headline: Stylish earrings to gold shoes on show at South Africa's biggest political event
Author: Danai Nesta Kupemba, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-07T12:14:48.145Z
Text: Politicians, musicians, and celebrities arrived in their most glamorous looks for one of South Africa's biggest political events - the State of the Nation Address (Sona), making it almost as much about fashion as politics.
Sona is a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament in Cape Town to mark the start of the government's work for the year, where President Cyril Ramaphosa paints a picture of where the country stands and outlines the road ahead.
In his speech, President Ramaphosa talked about the nation's resilience, earning rapturous applause when he declared, "South Africa will not be bullied."
His stance comes after his US counterpart Donald Trump threatened to cut funding over South Africa's land policy.
While governance takes centre stage, Sona has evolved into a fashion spectacle over the years, with MPs using their outfits to support local designers and showcase South African talent.
The outfits are always a hot topic on social media, and this year is no exception.
Praise singer Inako Mateza, this year's imbongi (traditional praise poet), played a key role in one of the most significant Sona traditions.
Through song and dance, she recounted President Cyril Ramaphosa's life story and history, blending tradition with a personal touch.
She ended her performance by addressing the president with his well-known nickname, "Cupcake."
South Africa Minister of Water and Sanitation, Pemmy Majodina wore a traditional outfit and spectacular earrings.
Her Xhosa-inspired outfit was made by self-taught seamstress, Zoleka Vicky Magwaca, from the Mthatha Art Centre in Eastern Cape
"I am committed to supporting local designers," Majodina told Eye Witness News on the red carpet.
Water was a key part of Ramaphosa's speech, as he said there would be investment in several water projects to address the shortages affecting the whole country.
Draped in gold, this snazzy dresser is legendary Kwaito singer, Gezani Kobane, also known as Papa Penny. He is a member of former President Jacob Zuma's party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK).
As MK cements its presence in South African politics as the main opposition party, figures like Kobane are drawing attention both for their political stance and their distinctive style.
But Zuma wasn't in attendance, as he was dealing with his ongoing trial on allegations of corruption over an arms deal. He denies any wrongdoing.
Outside parliament, there is a red carpet for guests and ministers to strike a pose.
This year's Sona was held at Cape Town City Hall as the parliament building is still being rebuilt after a fire ripped through the building in 2022.
Sports Minister Gayton Mckenzie looked dapper in an all-black ensemble with matching sunglasses.
South African politician and Pondo traditional leader Mwelo Nonkonyana, who now serves on the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa in the Eastern Cape made sure his heritage was on full display.
The traditional beaded staff is a symbol of wisdom and authority, making it the perfect finishing touch for Sona.
Julius Malema's party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) arrived in their trademark red overalls. The party has disrupted previous Sonas, but this year they were relatively calm.
Malema expressed his disappointment in President Ramaphosa speech and told local broadcaster eNCA, it was just "waffle".
Lindiwe Ntshalintshali, the Deputy Minister of Correctional Services, was dressed to the nines as she dazzled in a gold-beaded dress while listening to the speech.

Headline: Johannesburg revival: Bringing hope to one of world's most dangerous cities
Author: Ed Habershon, BBC News, Johannesburg
Published Date: 2025-02-06T14:33:21.677Z
Text: The view is spectacular from the top of Ponte Tower, one of the most famous buildings in the South African city of Johannesburg.
Built in 1975, standing almost 200m (656 ft) tall, it's a long-established feature of the city skyline, once the tallest residential building in Africa.
But like the city, it's had its ups and downs. In the 1980s it was taken over by criminal gangs, and its hollow core filled with rubbish up to 50m deep.
"The building got hijacked. There were no utilities, so most of the people were actually throwing their trash right inside the building, until it reached the 14th floor," said Delight Sithole, who runs tours of the building.
He added: "There were some dead bodies here, illegal firearms, drugs. The smell, I'm sure it was just horrible, just really like, hell on earth.
"If you asked anybody what happens in that round building, somebody would have something interesting or scary to say about it," said Sifiso Zikhali, who works with Mr Sithole in an organisation called Dlala Nje, which means "just play" in Zulu.
"People were scared of the neighbourhood," he said.
Johannesburg was seen as being one of the most dangerous cities in the world.
But the building turned itself around 15 years ago in the wake of the Fifa World Cup hosted in South Africa, and people started moving back in.
After Covid, people returned and the building is now around three-quarters full.
There is no escaping the issues that Johannesburg, and South Africa, face.
Despite signs of improvement in the most recent statistics, crime is still a major issue.
Crippling power cuts that plagued the city for years, known as load-shedding, came to an end almost a year ago, but now a water crisis is looming, leaving many without.
A building fire in the Central Business District (CBD) killed almost 80 people in the winter of 2023, and exposed the issue of hijacked buildings, disused housing and apartments blocks that have been taken over by criminal gangs who charge people to live there.
This is an area that's been regenerated by a property company called Ithemba, which is Zulu for "hope". And it's a company that is seeing business booming in Johannesburg.
A few days later, on a tour of one of Ithemba's flagship residential developments called Jewel City, senior manager Alan Tait explains the turnaround.
"The demand is just phenomenal, and that demand is specifically to live in the CBD," he said.
He said that the company currently leases 7,200 properties and is expected to double that over the next two years.
Named after its origins as a diamond dealing district, like the Ponte building the area fell into disrepair, only to see a resurgence.
"We launched Jewel City about five years ago, just as Covid was hitting. So the timing was a little bit out. But as soon as Covid lifted, the buildings filled up quite quickly," he said.
As we near the edge of the development, he points out a long strip of lights under a flyover. They were put up to provide light in an area that had been dark for some time, largely due to the loadshedding affected the city.
It was part of an initiative by a group called JoziMyJozi which started in 2023. One of its first projects was to light up the Nelson Mandela bridge, a centrepiece of the city, that meant people once again found it safe to use.
"So the whole aim of JoziMyJozi is to bring hope back to the residents of the city," said Bea Swanepoel, CEO of the organisation, in the courtyard behind her office in Rosebank, north of the city centre.
"And by bringing hope back, we need to show some visible improvements and impactful projects so that they can see there's a way out of where we are currently, and to live in the city of the future, where people can be safe and where they can thrive and where there are jobs."
The group also launched the gateway project, an effort to clean up the ten main entrances to the city, and they've begun to tackle everything from potholes, to homelessness to education.
Could Johannesburg one day be spoken about like London, Paris or New York?
"Well, that is the intention," said Ms Swanepoel. "Much of what's happening in Joburg is due to perceptions. We have a long way to go. I mean, there's no doubt about that, but it's not impossible. We need to get up there and be the gold standard for cities in Africa."
The city is due to host the G20 later this year, which will bring new investment and attention to the city.
Back on 51st floor of the Ponte tower, Sifiso Zikhali gazes out of the window.
Does he think Dlala Nje is succeeding in its mission?
"Yes we are, because one of our biggest challenges was to get people coming here. We are now one of the city's top attractions. This is our city, and whatever we face, we need at the end to find a solution for it," he said.

Headline: Malawi president orders troops to withdraw from DR Congo
Author: Paul Njie in Rusizi & Basillioh Rukanga in Nairobi, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-06T12:51:14.573Z
Text: Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera has ordered the military to begin preparing to withdraw from their peacekeeping mission in the volatile eastern Democratic of Congo.
The Malawian troops are part of the southern African regional bloc's military mission (SAMIDRC) deployed to DR Congo to help tackle armed groups.
At least 20 peacekeepers, including 14 South Africans and three Malawians, were killed as the M23 rebels captured the key city of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, last week.
President Chakwera said on Wednesday that his decision was meant to "honour the declaration of a ceasefire by the parties", even though the fighting is continuing.
In a statement read on state TV on Wednesday evening, he said the withdrawal of troops would "pave the way for their planned negotiations towards a lasting peace".
Malawi Information Minister Moses Kunkuyu told the BBC Newsday programme that the planned withdrawal was being "made in good faith".
He said a meeting by southern African leaders last week in Tanzania, on the sidelines of the Africa Energy Summit, had passed a resolution "to call for a ceasefire from all parties in the conflict, just to pave way for peaceful negotiations".
"It is pursuant to that agreement that the president of Malawi has seen it fit to contribute to the peace-building effort by withdrawing troops from the region so that there is that peaceful negotiation".
He did not indicate exactly when the troops would leave, but said what remained were the "operational aspects" and that they had communicated the decision to the DR Congo president and the southern Africa bloc.
On Monday, the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group declared a unilateral ceasefire "for humanitarian reasons", which was due to start the following day.
However, fighting has since resumed, and the rebels have reportedly taken the mining town of Nyabibwe in the South Kivu province.
The Malawian president has been under pressure to withdraw his country's forces from DR Congo in the wake of the deaths of peacekeepers.
South Africa has faced similar pressure, but President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to keep his troops in DR Congo, saying they are subject to the SAMIDRC mission "which has operational timeframes and an end date". The mission was initially deployed in 2023 and was last year extended until December this year.
The SAMIDRC mission was authorised by the southern African bloc (Sadc) to have 5,000 troops from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.
South Africa, which leads the mission, was to deploy 2,900 troops and the rest shared between Malawi and Tanzania - although it is not clear how many troops are currently there.
Malawi also has some soldiers in DR Congo serving under the UN peacekeeping force Monusco.
Sadc leaders are due to meet in Tanzania this Saturday in a special joint summit with East African heads of states to address the DR Congo crisis.
Bitter rivals DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame are both expected to attend.
Meanwhile, the Ugandan military has denied reports it has sent troops to eastern DR Congo because of the fighting in and around Goma.
Since their capture of Goma, the rebels have been seeking to seize territories in South Kivu, especially the capital Bukavu. Congolese authorities have enlisted hundreds of civilian volunteers to help defend the city.
The rebel group has appointed top officials including a governor of North Kivu, to administer the territory.
For the first time since they seized Goma, the M23 on Thursday held a rally in the city that saw rebel leader Corneille Nangaa address large crowds at the Unity Stadium.
A warrant for Nangaa's arrest has been issued by a military court in Kinshasa, accusing him of war crimes and treason.
The UN says nearly 3,000 people were killed during the M23's violent campaign to seize Goma.
There are fears that diseases such as Mpox and cholera could spread beyond the city.
The International Criminal Court has said its prosecutors are closely following events in DR Congo "including the grave escalation of violence over the past week".

Headline: Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo
Author: Damian Zane, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-05T18:40:22.682Z
Text: There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging.
It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.
The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.
The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal – including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.
It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more – of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.
The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business
Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan – the ore from which tantalum is extracted – is mined.
Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.
Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry.
Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.
They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.
Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a "state-like administration", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (£20) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working.
It runs the area as a monopoly making sure – through the threat of arrest and detention – that only its authorised traders are able to do business.
The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.
There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.
Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.
Theoretically, a traceability system - known as the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics is sourced responsibly and avoids conflict financing and human rights abuses.
The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold – so-called "conflict minerals" – are not inadvertently funding violence.
But Itsci has come under some criticism.
Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.
Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.
He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.
"There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves."
In a statement to the BBC, Itsci said it covers 3,000 mine sites and that it works "at any mine, regardless of their size or remoteness, following the goal of 'leaving no-one behind'... Excluding remote areas would be the opposite of responsible sourcing and would exacerbate potential risks."
Itsci added that these remote communities have benefitted from its support. The scheme has also been praised for bringing "prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners".
In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town.
Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan.
The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to "heavy-duty trucks" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them.
Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is mixed with Rwandan production leading to a "significant contamination of supply chains".
The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya - setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen.
"A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing," he told the BBC.
Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda.
In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country.
"It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit," she added.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their "expertise".
Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there.
In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using "conflict minerals".
Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda.
Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.

Headline: Era-defining Benin musician dies aged 39
Author: Rachida Houssou, BBC News, Cotonou
Published Date: 2025-02-05T18:25:26.975Z
Text: Tributes have been paid to Willy Mignon, an era-defining Beninese musician who died at the age of 39.
The artist passed away hours after having a seizure, his sister Christel told the BBC, adding that she was not clear on the exact cause of death.
Mignon's career took off in 2006 with Minédji, a hit song that remains beloved in Benin almost 20 years later.
The West African country's ministry of culture remembered Mignon as "an emblematic figure of the first generation of urban artists of the 2000s."
"His songs, with their swaying rhythms and unique energy, marked an entire era and inspired many other talents," a statement from the ministry said.
Mignon died on Tuesday, after being admitted to hospital in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou.
The father-of-five had moved to neighbouring Burkina Faso two years ago, for professional reasons.
After news of Mignon's death broke, his manager of nine years, Aziz Ademorou, described the musician as "a fighter who always believed in himself".
Mignon had demonstrated this confidence in an interview with Benin's Frissons Radio.
"I started out with my first single Mindédji, which was both a trial and a master-stroke... the public loved it," he said.
Mignon was also well known for creating a rhythm and dance style named Noudjihou. Noudjihou was inspired by Benin highlife music.
Mignon's music had made an impression in his new home, Burkina Faso, too.
In January last year he produced Hymnes Aux Étalons, an African Cup of Nations anthem for Burkina Faso's national team.

Headline: Israeli tourist one of two women gang-raped in India, police say

Text: Two women were gang-raped and a man was killed in an attack near a popular Unesco World Heritage site in southern India, according to police.
The two women - an Israeli tourist and an Indian homestay operator - were stargazing with three male tourists near a lake in Hampi, Karnataka, when they were attacked by a group of men on Thursday night, police superintendent Ram Arasiddi told Reuters.
Arasiddi said the assailants pushed the men into the Tungabhadra River canal before raping the women.
Two of the men, one of them American, survived, and the third man's body was recovered on Saturday morning, he said.
"Five people - two women and three men - were attacked near Sanapur," Arasiddi said.
"Two of them are foreigners, an American [man], and another a woman from Israel."
Police have arrested two of the men accused of the attack and an investigation is ongoing, Arasiddi said.
Police believe the men followed the group.
According to witness testimony from one of the women, the group was stargazing near a temple in Sanapur when three men arrived on a motorcycle and asked them where they could get petrol.
As one member of the group gave them directions, one of the three men demanded 100 rupees ($1.29) from the tourists.
"Since the homestay operator did not know them, she told them they had no money," police said.
"When the men repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.
"After that, the three men allegedly started arguing."
The body of one of the male tourists was later found in the Tungabhadra canal in Karnataka's Koppal district.
A case has been registered at Gangavathi Rural Police Station under sections related to extortion, robbery, gang rape and attempted murder.
The victims are receiving medical treatment at a government hospital, the police said.
Hampi, an ancient village in the south Indian state of Karnataka, is home to numerous ruins and temples from the Vijayanagara Empire. It was declared as a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1986.
In a post on X, Chief Minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah wrote: "The attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and homestay owner is a most heinous act.
"As soon as the incident was reported, I obtained information from the relevant police, conducted a thorough investigation, and instructed them to quickly identify the culprits.
"The police have arrested two accused in connection with the case and are continuing the investigation."
Attacks on women in India gained international attention last year after the brutal rape-homicide of a junior doctor at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata.
The attack sparked national outrage and protests over a lack of safety for women.

Headline: Myanmar's military government says it will hold elections in next year

Text: The head of Myanmar's military government has said the country will hold a national election in December 2025 or January 2026.
General Min Aung Hlaing said the elections would be "free and fair" - adding that 53 political parties had already submitted their lists to participate.
It would be the first vote since his military junta seized power in a 2021 coup, arresting and imprisoning democratically elected leader Aung San Sung Kyi and making unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the previous year's elections.
Since then, the country has been in turmoil, with a protest movement against the junta turning into an armed rebellion across the country.
Critics have described the announcement as a sham designed to maintain the junta's power through proxy political parties.
Human Rights Watch, an NGO, told the BBC: "The junta is delusional if they think an election under the current circumstances will be considered remotely credible.
"As a precursor to elections, they need to end the violence, release all those arbitrarily detained, and allow all political parties to register and participate instead of dissolving opposition parties."
The military junta has carried out a violent crackdown on dissent since taking power, executing democracy activists and imprisoning journalists.
But it has struggled to contain a widespread insurgency involving pro-democracy and ethnic rebel groups, and has limited control outside major cities.
The UN, citing the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), said in January that at least 6,231 civilians have been killed by the military, including 1,144 women and 709 children, over the past four years.
It warned in September that Myanmar was "sinking into an abyss of human suffering".

Headline: South Korea's impeached president Yoon released from detention

Text: South Korea's impeached president has been released from detention after a court in Seoul overturned his arrest on technical grounds.
Yoon Suk Yeol walked free on Saturday to cheers from his supporters - but still faces trial on insurrection charges after his failed attempt to impose martial law in December.
He was arrested in January in a dawn raid at the presidential palace after a tense fortnight where he had resisted being taken in and there were clashes between his security detail and police.
But he walked free on Saturday after 52 days in custody. "I bow my head in gratitude to the people of this nation," he said in a statement distributed by his lawyers following his release.
After waving to supporters outside the centre, he was driven in an official convoy back to the presidential compound in Seoul, where he was greeted by more supporters.
More than 50,000 protesters staged rallies in his support in the capital on Saturday, while there was also a slightly smaller counter-protest, Yonhap reported.
Mr Yoon's lawyers secured his release after arguing it was illegal to hold him in custody. The courts agreed, based on a number of legal technicalities, although the prosecutors described the ruling as "unjust".
He is due to stand trial later this year for the attempt to put the democratic country under martial law. It only lasted six hours - but polarised the nation.
If convicted he could face life in prison or even the death penalty.
Although currently suspended from office, Mr Yoon is still South Korea's president in name.
He also faces a separate Constitutional Court ruling which will decide on whether to uphold his impeachment and formally strip him from office. The judges' decision is expected in the coming days.
Despite the court cases, Mr Yoon's supporters have rallied around him - and authorities are bracing themselves for unrest.

Headline: Who's doing the dishes? Bollywood film and government data have the same answer
Author: Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai
Published Date: 2025-03-08T00:27:37.264Z
Text: A new Bollywood film - Mrs - has once again laid bare a stark reality: even in well-educated households in India a woman's role is often confined to unpaid domestic work.
The protagonist, married to a gynaecologist, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and caregiving. Her dreams are sidelined not by force, but by relentless criticism and quiet coercion.
While the film, which is a remake of the hit Malayalam movie The Great Indian Kitchen, has sparked conversation - and pushback, especially from men on social media - its themes resonate with hard data.
A recent government survey reveals that Indian women spend over seven hours a day on unpaid domestic and caregiving work - more than twice the time men do. Data shows that women spend 289 minutes on unpaid domestic work and 137 minutes on unpaid caregiving, whereas men spend 88 minutes on chores and 75 minutes on care work.
They also spent less time than men doing paid work and engaging in self-care activities.
What's disappointing is that the last such survey which came out six years ago had similar results. Despite the government launching campaigns to empower women, the situation hasn't changed much.
India's Time Use Surveys (TUS) track how people spend their time across various activities. Surveyors gather data nationwide by asking individuals aged six to 59 how they spent the previous day. The first TUS was released in 2019, with the second published last week.
When the government released findings from the second Time Use Survey (TUS), it highlighted two key shifts: women aged 15 to 59 spent 10 minutes less on unpaid domestic work, while their participation in employment and related activities rose by just over three percentage points.
The survey concluded this marked a "shift from unpaid to paid activities" for women - a positive sign that they were spending less time on domestic chores and more time in paid employment.
However, economists argue this isn't necessarily true. Even if it is, the slight drop in domestic work suggests women are still juggling paid jobs with a heavier load of unpaid work than men.
Ashwini Deshpande, an economics professor at Ashoka University, says TUS data should be analysed alongside India's Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) for a deeper understanding of how women spend their time. FLFPR measures the percentage of women aged 15 and above in the labour force.
According to government data, the FLFPR grew from about 23% in 2017-2018 to 37% in 2022-2023. Prof Deshpande says that this increase is not solely due to an increase in employment opportunities for women, but has also been spurred by economic distress.
"Women are not waiting for their time spent on domestic chores to reduce to take up jobs. Research shows that women want to work to supplement household incomes and so they end up working 'double-shifts', doing paid work outside the home and unpaid work inside," Prof Deshpande says.
Indian women aren't alone in shouldering a disproportionate share of household and caregiving work - it's a global reality. However, the gap in time spent on domestic work is significantly wider in India.
Where globally women spend about 2.8 hours more than men on domestic and care work, for Indian women, this difference is closer to four hours.
Sociologists attribute this to India's deeply patriarchal society, which continues to enforce strict gender norms. Even among the educated elite, women remain confined by roles upheld and perpetuated not just by men, but also by women.
This rigid enforcement of gender roles doesn't just shape women's lives - it also shapes the way stories about them are received.
So, while Mrs struck a chord with many, it also faced sharp criticism - especially from men on social media.
A men's rights group accused it of "spreading toxicity" against traditional joint families, while others dismissed its premise altogether.
Kajol Srinivasan, a Mumbai-based comedian, says the film ruffled feathers because it held up an uncomfortable mirror to society.
She told the BBC how her father, who quit his job at 40 to take over household duties while her mother continued working, quickly realised that housework was no easy task.
"The first week he was excited; he cooked different dishes and deep-cleaned the house," she says.
But then he began to find the work tedious and couldn't continue beyond a week.
"My father realised that housework was not just about work, it was also an imbalance in power. The power always stays with the breadwinner; no matter how well you cook, there are no accolades," she says.
She believes that women are expected and raised to accept this lower rung of power.
"When Indian men talk about what they like about their wives and mothers, it often has a lot to do with how much they have sacrificed for them or how much they take care of them or the home," Ms Srinivasan says.
India's Time Use Survey shows that social change is slow, and it may take time before women spend less on domestic work.
In the meantime, films like Mrs spark conversations around everyday questions many prefer to avoid - like, who's doing the dishes?

Headline: Students now free to choose their hairstyles, Thai court rules
Author: Koh Ewe, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore, Thanyarat Doksone, BBC News, Reporting fromBangkok
Published Date: 2025-03-07T07:50:59.800Z
Text: After years of wrangling with authorities, students in Thailand can now let their hair down. Literally.
On Wednesday, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court annulled a 50-year-old directive by the education ministry, which had previously set out rules on hairstyles for school students: short hair for boys and ear-length bobs for girls.
In practice, hairstyle rules have been gradually relaxed across many schools. But some still used the 1975 junta-issued directive as a guideline, and would cut the hair of students who didn't adhere.
The 1975 directive violated individual freedoms protected by the constitution and was out of touch with today's society, the court said.
The court decision this week came in response to a petition, filed by 23 public school students in 2020, which argued that the 1975 directive was unconstitutional.
Student activists have long campaigned for hairstyle rules to be relaxed, saying it infringes on their human dignity and personal freedom over their bodies.
One of them is Panthin Adulthananusak, who recently graduated from university.
"In the eyes of kids like us back then… even though it seemed impossible, we wanted to do something," he told the BBC. "If no student in Thai history rose up to challenge the power of the adults that suppressed us, it would be a lifelong embarrassment."
In response to such campaigns, the education ministry in 2020 allowed students to have longer hairstyles - but there remained some restrictions. Boys' hair could not cover the nape of their necks, while girls with long hair had to tie it up.
Those regulations were revoked in 2023, with then education minister Trinuch Thienthong announcing that students, parents and school authorities should negotiate their own common ground on what is acceptable for hairstyles in their schools.
But through all these changes, some schools continued to follow the standard laid out in the original 1975 directive.
Schools have traditionally associated short hair with discipline and tidiness - an argument that has been repeated by many social media users this week. But in recent years reports of schools banning bangs or dyed hair have sparked public outcry across Thailand.
In some parts of the country, teachers are known to shoddily cut students' hair during morning assembly to punish them for flouting hairstyle rules. Such practices have continued even as education authorities warned teachers against it.
In January, the Ministry of Education reiterated that it had repealed restrictions on hair length for all students, saying it recognised the "importance of promoting diversity and fairness in all aspects of education".
Wednesday's court decision, which also says that schools' hairstyle rules should consider the freedom and dignity of students, reaffirms the official push to leave hair choices up to students themselves.
But Panthin said the revoking of the decades-old directive "still leaves a hole for schools to set their own rules". In cases where schools have more conservative management, he suggested, restrictions could remain in place.
Nonetheless, Panthin said he "felt glad that what I had seen and fought all along was acknowledged and there was a tangible progress".
"I hope this court's ruling will set a new standard for the understanding about basic human rights at the school."

Headline: The 'traitor' at the heart of South Korea's impeachment drama

Text: Han Dong-Hoon was driving home from dinner in Seoul on December 3, scanning the radio, when he heard a breaking news update: President Yoon Suk-Yeol was preparing to deliver an emergency address.
Han, then the leader of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP), was widely seen as one of the presiden't closest allies. Yet that was Han's first hint that Yoon was about to do something unprecedented.
By midnight, the president had plunged the country into a political maelstrom, declaring martial law as part of a self-proclaimed bid to eliminate "anti-state forces" and North Korea sympathisers.
"When I first heard the news of martial law, I thought, 'We must stop it, because if it isn't lifted that very night, a bloodbath might occur,'" Han tells BBC Korean.
"The fear and terror that South Korea's decades-long, hard-won achievements might suddenly collapse were overwhelming."
Soon after Yoon's announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader hosted a live stream urging people to assemble in protest outside the National Assembly building in central Seoul.
Thousands responded, clashing with police and blocking military units as opposition lawmakers rushed into the assembly building, clambering over fences and walls in a desperate attempt to block Yoon's order.
Han was among them.
The late-night martial law edict seemed to have come from nowhere. It was, and remains, unclear who in Yoon's party supported or even knew of the move before it was made. But in the hours that followed, Han would help lead a successful attempt to overturn Yoon's order and have the declaration lifted.
Weeks later, he would also play a key role in impeaching the disgraced president – a move that would see him branded a "traitor" by mainstream members of the PPP, and ultimately lead to his resignation as party leader.
Han says he has "no regrets" about overturning Yoon's martial law attempt, insisting that he'd "choose the same again".
But in many people's eyes, his subsequent decision to impeach the very president he'd helped get elected was a surprising heel turn for someone formerly viewed as Yoon's right-hand man.
"We have experienced so much together over many years," Han says of his relationship with Yoon.
"I find the current situation extremely painful and regretful. Both the president and I worked in good faith for the betterment of our country – yet I must say that I deeply regret how things have turned out."
For years, Han and Yoon were inseparable allies. Having both attended Seoul National University, the two forged a close bond as prosecutors while jointly investigating corruption in the country's halls of power.
Han gained political prominence when Yoon was narrowly elected president in May 2022, after beating his opponent by less than 1% of the vote.
Han was made Minister of Justice and later entrusted with the key role of Emergency Countermeasures Committee Chairman for the PPP, becoming the leader of the ruling party at the age of 50.
Yoon's time in office was beleaguered by scandals and political failures – not least of all his landslide loss to the opposition Democratic Party last April.
The result of those parliamentary elections was widely seen as a vote of no confidence against Yoon, and rendered him a lame-duck president.
For most of Yoon's administration, the PPP's conservative base was enthusiastic about Han. The lawyer-turned-politician had quickly emerged as a likely party candidate for the next presidential election, originally scheduled for 2027.
Now, as the increasing likelihood of a 2025 election looms amid the fallout of Yoon's ill-fated martial law attempt, Han's reputation is largely defined by the way he acted during and after that fateful night.
While some still see him as a fresh and promising political figure, many view him as having betrayed the very president who had furthered his career.
In the weeks following Yoon's abortive martial law order, the embattled president curried favour among PPP hardliners by refusing to cede political ground.
While he apologised for the events of December 3, he refused to resign, instead holing up in his official residence in defiance of calls for his impeachment.
He rallied his base and defended his decision by playing on unsubstantiated fears that the country was in danger.
It was these staunch Yoon loyalists who would come to turn against Han.
Despite having rejected Yoon's martial law declaration on December 3, Han initially opposed the impeachment motion put forth against the president by South Korea's political opposition – siding with almost every other PPP member in boycotting the first vote on December 7.
Days later, Han changed course. This was after allegations had emerged that during the martial law attempt Yoon had ordered key political figures – including Han – to be arrested. In allegiance with his close political aides, Han threw his full support behind a second and ultimately successful impeachment attempt, ousting Yoon as president.
"I wanted nothing more than for this government to succeed," Han tells the BBC, reflecting on the storm of condemnation that then followed from within his own party ranks.
"I initially sought an orderly early resignation plan for the president – a plan I earnestly pursued, but which ultimately failed," he adds.
"I am deeply pained by the outcome and empathise with those who remain unconvinced and heartbroken. Nonetheless, I believe it was a necessary decision for South Korea's continued progress and development."
Yoon has been suspended from his presidential duties and is currently under investigation on insurrection charges. Han, meanwhile, stepped down as PPP leader in mid-December, maintaining that although Yoon's impeachment was painful, he did not regret his decision.
In the two months that followed, Han says he took some time to "quietly reflect" on whether he could have done more during such a turbulent period for South Korea.
"And I wrote a book," he adds: a memoir, titled "The People Come First", which chronicles the two weeks following Yoon's martial law declaration.
It's no surprise the book has become a bestseller: after all, it claims to be a first-hand account of events that have already gone down as some of the most dramatic in South Korea's political history. It hit shelves on 26 February, one day after the Constitutional Court held its final hearing on Yoon's impeachment trial.
It also hints at Han's future ambitions. Publishing a memoir is seen as a common first step in launching a political campaign in South Korea, and some believe "The People Come First" underscores Han's hopes to run as the PPP's presidential candidate, if the court impeaches Yoon and triggers a snap election.
Within the book's 384 pages, Han also discusses the need for constitutional reform and suggests that if he were to become president, he would change South Korea's five-year presidential term to four years.
Should he choose to run, the memoir serves to remind South Koreans where he stands on crucial issues - and that he is no longer an ally of a disgraced president.
As it stands, the odds look stacked against him. A recent poll found that Han's approval rating to become the next president sat at 6% – a fraction of the 22% rating he scored in January 2024. The decline of his political fortunes is compounded by the critics within the PPP, who accuse him of failing to protect both his former party and the president.
But Han plays down the suggestion that his memoir is intended as a political tool.
"I have published a book in which I truthfully express what I experienced and thought during these events," he tells the BBC. "I am not returning with any specific political manoeuvre, but simply to share that message with you all."
Another message Han seems eager to share is one of contrition towards the people of South Korea. He doesn't regret voting to impeach his president and former ally, he insists, but he does regret this.
"Yoon did impose martial law, and I believe that was a wrong act – one that does not align with the principles of liberal democracy," he says. "As the leader of the ruling party that put that president in office, I want to express my deepest apologies to the people."
"I am truly sorry that our actions, and the reactions we displayed, hurt the people. I think we must overcome and resolve this crisis."

Headline: The Indian film showing the bride's 'humiliation' in arranged marriage
Author: Geeta Pandey, BBC News•@geetapandeybbc, •

Text: It is often said that marriages are made in heaven.
But in India, where a majority of marriages are arranged, the process of match-making can feel like a passage through hell for a woman and her family.
That's the premise of Sthal: A Match, the 2023 gritty Marathi-language film that has won several prestigious awards at festivals in India and abroad. It is releasing for the first time in theatres in India on Friday.
Set in rural Maharashtra state, the film centres around Savita, a young woman striving for an education and a career in a patriarchal society, and the attempts by her father Daulatrao Wandhare - a poor cotton farmer - to find a good husband for his daughter.
"He wants a good price for his crop and a good match for his daughter," says director Jayant Digambar Somalkar.
The film is notable for the unflinching way it portrays what its lead actress calls the "very humiliating" experience of many young women, unlike other Indian movies about arranged marriage.
Sthal has also grabbed attention as its entire cast is made up of first-time actors chosen from the village where it is shot. Nandini Chikte, who plays Savita, has already won two awards for her brilliant performance.
The film opens with a sequence where Savita is interviewing a prospective groom.
Along with her female relatives and friends, she watches as the young man serves them drinks from a tray. They laugh when he, visibly nervous, fumbles during questioning.
Rudely awakened from what turned out to be a dream, Savita is told to get ready as a group of men are coming to see her.
In reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus.
The prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in.
Dressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators.
Questions come, thick and fast. What's your name? Full name? Mother's clan? Date of birth? Height? Education? Subject? Hobbies? Are you willing to work on the farm?
The men step out, to hold a discussion. "She's a bit dark. She had makeup on her face, but did you not see her elbow? That is her real colour," says one. "She's also short," he goes on to add. Others nod in agreement.
They leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision.
According to her parents, "this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair.
The scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides.
Savita's protestations - "I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman.
"Marriage is given far too much importance in our society," Chikte told the BBC. "Parents believe that once the daughter is married, they will become free of their responsibility. It's time to change that narrative."
She says she found it "very humiliating" that Savita was made to sit on a stool to be judged by all those men who discussed her skin colour, while there was no discussion about the prospective groom.
"I was only acting, but as the film progressed, I lived Savita's journey and I felt angry on her behalf. I felt insulted and disrespected."
The film also tackles the social evil that is dowry - the practice of the bride's family gifting cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family.
Though it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings.
Parents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries.
In the film too, Daulatrao puts up a "for sale" sign on his land, even though farming is his only source of livelihood.
Director Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience.
Growing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home.
"As a child you don't question tradition," he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride.
"This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her."
When he discussed the issue with his fiancée at the time - who is now his wife - she encouraged him to explore it in his work.
In a country where 90% of all marriages are still arranged by families, Sthal is not the first to tackle the subject on screen. IMDB has a list of nearly 30 films about arranged marriage made by Bollywood and regional film industries just in the past two decades.
More recently, the wildly popular Netflix show Indian Matchmaking focused entirely on the process of finding the perfect partner.
But, as Somalkar points out, "weddings are hugely glamourised" on screen.
"When we think of weddings in India, we think of the big fat wedding full of fun and glamour. We think of Hum Aapke Hain Koun," he says, referring to the 1990s Bollywood blockbuster that celebrates Indian wedding traditions.
"And the Netflix show only dealt with a certain class of people, the ones who are wealthy and educated and the women are able to exercise their choice.
"But the reality for a majority of Indians is very different and parents often have to go through hell to get their daughters married," he adds.
His reason for making Sthal, he says, is to "jolt society and audiences out of complacency.
"I want to start a debate and encourage people to think about a process that objectifies women who have very little freedom to choose between marriage and career," he says.
"I know one book or one film doesn't change society overnight, but it can be a start."

Headline: Fifteen hurt after SK fighter jets drop bombs by accident
Author: Jake Kwon, Hosu Lee & Koh Ewe, BBC News, Reporting fromSeoul and Singapore

Text: Fifteen people in South Korea were injured, two of them seriously, after a pair of fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs in a civilian district on Thursday during a live-fire military exercise, local media reported.
The incident involving the Air Force KF-16 aircraft, in the city of Pocheon near North Korea, was part of routine drills held by the South to maintain combat readiness against potential attacks from the North.
South Korea's Air Force said that it was investigating the incident and apologised for the damage, adding it would provide compensation to those affected.
While shells from live firing exercises sometimes land near civilian residences, they rarely cause injuries.
According to local media reports, two people suffered fractures to their necks and shoulders.
A 60-year-old who was driving when the explosion happened had shrapnel lodged in their neck, Yonhap reported.
"I was driving when I heard a 'bang'," they said. "When I woke up, I was in an ambulance."
"Our KF-16 (fighter jet) abnormally dropped eight shells of MK-82 bombs. It landed outside of firing range," said Korea's Air Force in a statement to the BBC.
The military said the pilot of one of the jets inputted the wrong coordinates by mistake, causing the bombs to drop in the civilian community.
Investigators have yet to determine why the second jet dropped its bombs, the military said, adding all live-fire exercises will be suspended.
One church building and houses were also damaged as a result of the incident.
Images published on local media show a broken window of a building and damaged roof of the church.
A local resident told Yonhap that he had been watching television at home when the explosion, which sounded "like a thunderclap", shook the house.
The director of a nearby senior citizen care centre said that the building's windows shattered and one of their teachers was taken to hospital with injuries. While no seniors were hurt, they said, "they were so frightened that we sent them all home".
Pocheon authorities told the BBC earlier on Thursday that residents had been evacuated while a bomb disposal team worked on safely disposing any unexploded bombs.
But authorities later said they did not find any unexploded bombs at the scene, Yonhap reported.
The defence ministry said the training on Thursday was related to a joint drill with US forces.
South Korea and the US are set to run combined drills from March 10 to March 20 - the first since US president Donald Trump's return to the White House. This comes at a time when the two countries are increasingly wary of the growing alliance between North Korea and Russia.
During another joint drill by South Korea and the US in 2022, troops fired a short-range ballistic missile which malfunctioned and crashed on a golf course in the military base. While the warhead did not explode, it still burst into flames and sent panic rippling across residents in the area.

Headline: North Korea halts tourism just weeks after reopening
Author: Jean Mackenzie, Seoul correspondent, Kelly Ng, BBC News

Text: North Korea has stopped tourists from visiting, just weeks after the first Western tourists entered the country for the first time in five years.
North Korea sealed itself off at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, and started to scale back restrictions in the middle of 2023.
It opened up to Russian visitors in 2024, but it was only last month that Western tourists were allowed into the remote, eastern city Rason.
However several tour companies now say that trips to the reclusive country have been cancelled until further notice. Pyongyang has not given a reason for the sudden halt.
"Just received news from our Korean partners that Rason is closed to everyone. We will keep you posted," China-based KTG Tours, which specialises in North Korean tours, said Wednesday on Facebook.
Young Pioneer Tours and Koryo Tours were among the other agencies that have announced the suspension.
Those planning tours in April and May should refrain from booking flights "until we have more information", Young Pioneer Tours said in a Facebook post.
On 20 February, the first Western tourists started arriving in Rason, a city earmarked by the North as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies.
Tour operators told the BBC the visitors' movements were even more restricted than on pre-pandemic trips - they had fewer opportunities to wander the streets and talk to locals.
Phone signals and internet access were also not available in the hermit state.
One tour leader said he suspects Rason was picked because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.
Earlier this week, Koryo Tours said it was accepting international applications for the Pyongyang Marathon for the first time in five years. The event is scheduled for 6 April but it is now unclear if these can still be processed.
North Korea saw some 350,000 foreign tourists in 2019, of whom 90% were Chinese, according to media reports.

Headline: Can Trump's tariffs break China's grip on manufacturing?
Author: Joel Guinto, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore
Published Date: 2025-03-05T22:47:04.050Z
Text: US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.
This is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes.
Trump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.
China's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (£788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).
It has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s.
So how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?
Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.
Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.
So, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.
Increasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.
Trump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.
Trump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US.
He also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.
Yes, analysts say.
Exports have been the "saving grace" of China's economy and if the taxes linger, exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC.
The sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus.
"The tariffs will hurt China," Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. "They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand."
That is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs.
Chinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.
While tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.
"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China," Ms Garcia-Herrero said.
China had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an "early mover" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.
Chinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.
"It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple."
China has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.
And it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.
China has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.
And yet, Trump's recent tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.
"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough," she said.
What concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips.
These restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.
It's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.
Although this could "impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power," Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.
On the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will boost its high-value exports.
It happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.
"The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors," Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.
The government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.
A shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.
China already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world.
"The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force," said Mr Cruise of Moody's.
But that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.
Analysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico.
Chinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other.

Headline: Bangladesh leader likens Sheikh Hasina regime to 'terrible tornado'
Author: Samira Hussain, BBC South Asia correspondent, Dhaka
Published Date: 2025-03-05T22:45:42.605Z
Text: Bangladesh's interim leader says he felt "dazzled" when asked to take charge after long-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina was driven from power last year.
"I had no idea I'd be leading the government," Muhammad Yunus told the BBC. "I had never run a government machine before and had to get the buttons right.
"Once that settled down, we started organising things," the Nobel-prize winning economist said, adding that restoring law and order and fixing the economy were priorities for the country.
It's unclear if Hasina, who fled into exile in India, and her party will participate in elections Yunus hopes to hold later this year. She is wanted in Bangladesh for alleged crimes against humanity.
"They [the Awami League] have to decide if they want to do it, I cannot decide for them," said Yunus in an interview with the BBC at his official residence in Dhaka.
"The election commission decides who participates in the election."
He said: "Peace and order is the most important thing, and the economy. It's a shattered economy, a devastated economy.
"It's as if there's been some terrible tornado for 16 years and we're trying to pick up the pieces."
Sheikh Hasina was elected prime minister in 2009 and ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist. Members of her Awami League government ruthlessly cracked down on dissent. There were widespread allegations of human rights violations and the murder and jailing of political rivals while she was prime minister.
A student-led uprising forced Ms Hasina from office in August. At the behest of protesters, Yunus came back to Bangladesh to lead the new interim government.
He says he will hold elections between December 2025 and March 2026, depending on how quickly his government can institute reforms he believes necessary for free and fair elections.
"If reforms can be done as quickly as we wish, then December would be the time that we would hold elections. If you have a longer version of reforms, then we may need a few more months."
"We are coming from complete disorder," he said, referring to the violent protests that engulfed Bangladesh last summer. "People getting shot, killed."
But almost seven months on, people in Dhaka say law and order has not yet been restored, and that things are not getting better.
"Better is a relative term," he said. "If you are comparing it to the last year for example at the same time, it looks okay.
"What is happening right now, is no different than any other time."
Yunus blames many of Bangladesh's current woes on the previous government.
"I am not supporting that these things should happen. I'm saying that, you have to consider, we are not an ideal country or an ideal city that suddenly we made. It's a continuum of the country that we inherited, a country that's been running for many, many years."
Victims of Sheikh Hasina's brutal regime remain angry. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent months, demanding she be prosecuted for the deadly crackdown on student protesters.
A court in Bangladesh has issued a warrant for her arrest, but India has yet to respond.
Now, under Yunus's leadership, there are questions about the safety of those belonging to Sheikh Hasina's political party.
In February, several homes of Awami League members, including that of the founder of Bangladesh - Hasina's late father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - were vandalised and set on fire after her supporters were told she would give an address on YouTube.
In a post on social media, the Awami League accused the interim government of justifying violence.
When asked by the BBC about claims by members of the Awami League that Bangladesh is not safe for them, Yunus was quick to defend his government.
"There's a court, there's a law, there's a police station, they can go and complain, register their complaint," he said. "You just don't go to a BBC correspondent to complain, you go to the police station to complain and see whether the law is taking its course."
The Trump administration's decision to cut foreign aid and effectively end almost all programmes funded by the US Agency for International Development will have an impact on countries like Bangladesh.
"It is their decision," says Yunus.
"It's been helpful. Because they are doing things that we wanted to get done, like fighting corruption and things like that, which we couldn't afford right away."
The United States is the third largest supplier of official development assistance to Bangladesh. Last year the US committed $450m in foreign aid.
When asked how it will make up the shortfall, Yunus says "When it happens, we will make do."

Headline: Boom to gloom: India middle-class jitters amid trillion-dollar market rout
Author: Soutik Biswas and Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News•@soutikBBC, •

Text: Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds.
With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five.
But the tide has turned.
For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge.
India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third.
"For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market," Mr Kumar says.
Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; £16,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. "Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank," he says.
His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution.
The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media "finfluencers" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike.
Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor.
When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market.
"I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!"
For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. "I'm both ignorant and confident," he says with wry candour. "Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype."
Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. "The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains," he says.
In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. "When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed."
Mr Sircar lives in hope. "My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green."
There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic.
Hooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market.
"I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me," he says.
Ramesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in.
"This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic," says financial adviser Samir Doshi. "Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next."
Fuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets.
On the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. "The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations," says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. "Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?"
This market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses.
"In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings," noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst.
"Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances."
Financial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. "We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event."
But clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs.
Foreign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite.
Mr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious.
In the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors.
"This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal," says Ms Halan. "If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control."

Headline: Indian court orders release of Briton held without trial for years
Author: Neyaz Farooquee, BBC News, Delhi
Published Date: 2025-03-05T08:02:05.148Z
Text: A British man detained in India for six years without trial over a high-profile corruption case must be released on bail, the Delhi High Court has ruled.
Christian James Michel, an arms consultant, is accused of bribing Indian officials to win a multimillion-dollar helicopter contract for British-Italian defence company AgustaWestland. He denies the charge.
He was extradited to India from the United Arab Emirates in 2018 and has been in custody ever since, in what a judge called an "exceptional" situation.
The AgustaWestland controversy was one of several corruption cases linked to India's former ruling Congress party, some of which fizzled out eventually.
In 2010 the Indian government signed a deal with AgustaWestland's parent company to purchase 12 helicopters.
The alleged irregularities came to light when India's federal auditor reported that the government may have vastly overpaid for the $753m (£455m) deal, which was eventually scrapped in 2014.
According to court documents, Mr Michel is alleged to have received around €42m ($44.7m, £25m) for securing the contract. His lawyer has argued that there is no evidence to connect him with the alleged offence.
India's financial crime fighting agency and domestic crime bureau have held separate investigations into Mr Michel.
But both of those investigations have yet to be concluded and trials have yet to begin, leading to a "prolonged incarceration" of Mr Michel, the Delhi High Court noted.
The judge said his six years in pre-trial custody was also "alarmingly close" to the maximum punishment of seven years' imprisonment for money laundering, which is one of the charges he faces.
The court decided to grant him bail in one of the cases, after the Supreme Court did the same in another case on 18 February.
This means that Mr Michel is now free to leave Delhi's high-security Tihar jail, but he cannot leave India as his passport has been seized.
The deal for 12 three-engine AW-101 helicopters was signed in February 2010 after AgustaWestland beat off competition from US and Russian rivals.
The aircraft were intended for an elite squadron of the Indian air force which ferries around the president, the prime minister and other VIPs.
Only three of the helicopters were delivered to India before the deal was scrapped.
Italian prosecutors suspected that kickbacks worth almost $67.6m were paid to Indian officials to secure the contract.
Giuseppe Orsi, the former chief of AgustaWestland's parent company which at the time was called Finmeccanica, and Bruno Spagnolini, the former head of AgustaWestland, were tried in Italy on fraud and corruption charges.
Both were acquitted in 2018. Indian officials have said their acquittals would have no bearing on the case in India.
India's air force chief at the time of the deal was arrested for bribery in 2016, and later released on bail.

The week-long meeting is attended by nearly 3,000 delegates from provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and the armed forces. They usher through decisions that have already been made behind closed doors by party leaders.
Still, the meeting signals the priorities of the Chinese Communist Party for the coming year.

Headline: Can Tesla's EVs win over India's price-conscious buyers?
Author: Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi•@ArunodayM, •
Published Date: 2025-03-04T22:14:23.576Z
Text: After years of speculation, Tesla could finally be making its India debut.
The American electric vehicle (EV) giant has begun hiring for a dozen jobs in Delhi and Mumbai. It is also reportedly hunting for showrooms in both cities.
Asia's third largest economy offers an interesting growth opportunity for Tesla's futuristic cars as its global EV sales plummet and competition from Chinese manufacturers gets more intense.
But there's a million-dollar question - can Tesla compete in India's price-sensitive market?
Tata Motors currently holds pole position in India's EV market - with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India's JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. They are followed by Mahindra and Mahindra.
EVs made by these companies cost less than half of what consumers will have to shell out - around $40,000 (£31,637) - for just the base model of Tesla. It will, therefore, be seen as a luxury car, competing with higher-end EVs made by Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes.
Simply in volume terms, this will make India a tiny market for Tesla chief Elon Musk, unless the company introduces a low-cost model specifically for the country.
Besides price, India's road conditions could pose a challenge.
Tesla cars have very low ground clearance - or the distance between the lowest point of the car's undercarriage and the ground. This will make adapting to Indian roads difficult. To operate in the country, existing models may have to be re-engineered - which would drive up manufacturing costs.
Will Tesla do this just for one developing market where it could have only a small presence?
"It's been a challenge even with other global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) at the high end with small volumes. You can't justify these major engineering changes," Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India magazine, told the BBC.
Also, amidst all the hype, it is easy to forget that EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India. Even critical ancillary infrastructure, like charging stations, have taken years to come up. While they have picked up pace, there are only around 25,000 charging stations across India.
In effect, Tesla will be jostling for space in a very small, albeit growing, EV market.
But at a policy level, India appears to be making every effort to woo the carmaker.
The country has outlined an ambitious national vision to go electric. It plans to have 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses and 80% of two and three-wheelers go electric by 2030. Most provincial governments have also established their own EV policies to incentivise demand and supply.
Subsidies offered by India on electric cars are also the highest among major economies, according to HSBC Securities. They amount to as much as 46% of the price of the country's top-selling electric car model.
It's no surprise then that passenger EV sales have grown astronomically by over 2,000% in less than five years - going from a low base of 4,700 annually to a 100,000 cars.
"The price difference between regular cars and EVs has reduced a lot, making customers rethink their choice," says Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.
In April last year, India also cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (£400m) and starting local production within three years.
Tesla and other imported electric vehicles costing over $35,000 (£27,550) can now enjoy a lower import duty of 15% on up to 8,000 vehicles. This came after Musk complained that high import duties had prevented the firm from launching its cars in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
"It's quite clever, as it forces a global player to localise - which is the way the game works: come and build in India," says Sorabjee.
The proposed policy could put Indian domestic carmakers at a disadvantage, however, given that the investment requirement for foreign players is "not significant" compared to Indian players in this segment, an HSBC research paper warns.
Import duty of 15% is also "much lower" than the tax on comparable combustion engine cars in India which also pay an additional road tax, according to HSBC.
Domestic EV players say having a "level playing field" is important, but appear unperturbed by Tesla's impending entry for now.
"We welcome competition," Rajesh Jejurikar, Mahindra and Mahindra's Executive Director and CEO, told the BBC. His company feels that more players will strengthen India's existing EV ecosystem and is working to improve the appeal of their offerings.
Critical issues like "range anxiety" - the worry whether an EV's battery charge will be enough to complete a journey - have been addressed through "robust battery integration and rigorous real-world testing across diverse road conditions", says Mr Jejurikar, adding that the brand is deploying cutting-edge technology into their product.
It will be hard to beat Tesla's edge in this area though, and coupled with sturdier batteries and a better user interface, it will certainly differentiate Tesla cars from others in the market, says Sorabjee.
What might also give Tesla tailwind is the rising share of premium vehicles in the Indian auto market. As a global brand with a perceived "cool quotient", owning a Tesla will be a status symbol for the young, aspirational Indian population.
But none of this - India's EV policy or the growing demand for premium cars among India's affluent - has yet led to a commitment from Tesla to put manufacturing dollars into an EV facility.
For now, it appears the carmaker will only ship units from its factories abroad.
When that changes will depend on a lot of things - how quickly India's affluent consumer base widens, and what tariff structures look like once India completes trade negotiations with the US.
President Donald Trump has already voiced displeasure over Tesla potentially building a factory in India to avoid high tariffs. In an interview with Fox News recently, he said that this would be "unfair" to the US.
Could Trump's 'America First' policy diminish Musk's appetite for starting manufacturing units in India then?
The question is moot, but for now it does look like India will first get glitzy Tesla showrooms for its rich, rather than job-creating Tesla factories for its under-employed masses.

Headline: Thousands evacuated as Japan's biggest fire in decades continues to burn

Text: Japan has deployed more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the country's biggest forest fire in three decades.
At least one person has died in the blaze, which has torched more than 5,200 acres around the northern Japanese city of Ofunato since Thursday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA).
Although January to March is typically Ofunato's driest season, the area saw less rainfall last month than any February in more than 20 years - recording just 2.5 millimetres, compared to the usual average of 41.
About 4,600 people remain under government-issued evacuation orders as the fire continues to burn.
Some 2,000 have already left the area to stay with friends or relatives, and more than 1,200 have evacuated to shelters, officials said.
The fires are burning in a forest area of Iwate Prefecture, which is Japan's second largest prefecture and has the country's second-lowest population density.
More than 80 buildings are estimated to have been damaged so far, although FDMA noted that details are still being assessed.
"Although it is inevitable that the fire will spread to some extent, we will take all possible measures to ensure there will be no impact on people's homes," Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in parliament.
Thousands of firefighters from 14 prefectures, including Tokyo, have been dispatched to fight the fires. At least 16 helicopters are also being used, with images showing the aircraft dumping water onto the smouldering hills.
Like many other countries, Japan in 2024 recorded its hottest year since records began.
It is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened specific fires, because other factors - such as changes to the way land is used - are also relevant.
However, the IPCC says climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely.

Headline: USAID cuts shutter India's first clinic for transgender people
Author: Imran Qureshi, BBC Hindi, Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai
Published Date: 2025-03-03T10:54:53.030Z
Text: India's first medical clinic for transgender people has shut operations in three cities after US President Donald Trump stopped foreign aid to it.
Mitr (friend) Clinic, which was started in 2021 in the southern city of Hyderabad, offered HIV treatment, support and counselling services to thousands of transgender people.
Two more Mitr Clinics in Thane and Pune cities in western India, which were established the same year, have also shut down due to the aid cut.
In January, Trump signed an executive order pausing all foreign aid for 90 days, pending a review.
Trump has said he wants overseas spending to be closely aligned with his "America First" approach.
His crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid to foreign countries since the 1960s, has been seen as a step to this end.
The pausing of USAID funds has affected dozens of development programmes all around the world, especially in poor and developing countries.
In India, the shutting down of the Mitr Clinics has impacted the transgender community's access to crucial medical support.
The project came into existence under the US President's agency for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 when George Bush was president. John Hopkins University worked in collaboration with USAID and the Indian government to set it up.
A staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity to BBC Hindi said the three clinics catered to some 6,000 people and about 6% to 8% of the patients were being treated for HIV.
"All these cases were below 30 years of age. And 75% to 80% of this population was accessing health services for the first time," this staff member said.
In Hyderabad, the Mitr Clinic offered care to 150 to 200 transgender patients each month, many of whom suffered from HIV. The clinic had a small team of doctors, psychologists and technical staff.
"We were receiving 250,000 rupees ($2900; £2300) every month to provide services," Rachana Mudraboyina, a trans woman who was in-charge of the clinic, told BBC Hindi.
The news of the clinic's closure has come as a blow to the community.
Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli, a trans woman who has visited the clinic, told The Indian Express newspaper that she was "devastated" by the news as the clinic used to offer treatment at subsidised rates.
Another trans woman, who was hoping to use the clinic's services, told the Express that she was sad that she would no longer be able to do this.
India is estimated to have around two million transgender people, though activists say the number is higher. Despite a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that gives them the same rights as people of other genders, many still struggle to access education and healthcare due to stigma and discrimination.
There are state-run and private hospitals that offer medical help to the community, but many say they prefer going to Mitr Clinics because they find it more affordable and inclusive.
"Transgender people are not treated properly in general hospitals," Rachana says, explaining why the Mitr Clinics were so important for the community.
Trump's order freezing foreign aid has been criticised by many.
"USAID has made significant contributions in health and education and shutting it down is bound to have an impact on developing countries," Bubberjung Venkatesh, a lawyer, told BBC Hindi.
"It's a big blow. Its support for HIV prevention was significant," he added.
Last Thursday, the Trump administration said it was going to eliminate more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts. This means that very few projects will survive and the Mitr Clinics are unlikely to be among them.
Elon Musk, a close aide of Trump who also heads a government department in charge of slashing federal spending and jobs, has criticised funding projects for transgender people.
"That's what American tax dollars were funding," Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday in response to a post about the closure of the Mitr Clinics.
Meanwhile, staff at the clinic say they are looking for funding from other sources and hope that the state government will step in to help.
"We did a lot more than just provide medical help. The clinic also provided us a space to interact with the community, to share advice about various government schemes and health facilities," Rachana says.
"We want to continue [running the clinic] and are trying our best to find donors," she adds.

Headline: Dozens found alive in metal containers after India avalanche

Text: Dozens of construction workers have been pulled out alive from metal containers after they were buried by an avalanche in the Himalayas in India's Uttarakhand state.
They survived - some as long as nearly two days - as the containers in which they were living had enough oxygen to sustain them until rescuers could dig them out, Indian media reported quoting officials.
On Friday, 54 workers were buried when the avalanche hit a construction camp near Mana village. Eight were killed, while the other 46 were rescued.
The operation lasted almost 60 hours in sub-zero temperatures and concluded on Sunday.
Most of the labourers, who were working on a highway expansion project, were able to "withstand the wrecking avalanche" because of the containers, rescuers told The Indian Express newspaper.
"These metal shelters saved most of them. They had just enough oxygen to hold on until we got them out," a senior rescue official told The Times of India.
The newspaper reported that the force of the avalanche had hurled eight metal containers and a shed down the mountain.
Uttarakhand state Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has thanked rescue teams for their efforts in challenging conditions.
Members of the Indian army, national and state disaster response forces and local administration had worked to free the workers, using helicopters and drones for the operation.
Many of the rescued workers are receiving treatment at hospitals in the state's Joshimath town and Rishikesh city.
Satyaprakash Yadav, a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh who was among those rescued, said the "avalanche hit our container like a landslide", according to a video released by the army.
He added that the container he was in broke apart when the snow hit and it ended up near a river.
"We managed to get out on our own and reached a nearby army guest house, where we stayed overnight," he added.
Rajnish Kumar, a worker from Uttarkhand's Pithoragarh town, said most of them were sleeping when the avalanche struck.
"When the snow hit the container, it sank about 50 to 60 metres down [the mountain]. The Army arrived quickly and rescued us," he said, according to the army video.
Gaurav Kunwar, a former village council member of Mana, told the BBC on Friday the area where the avalanche hit was a "migratory area" and that it had no permanent residents.
"Only labourers working on border roads stay there in the winter," he said, adding that it had rained for two days prior to the avalanche.
The India Meteorological Department has warned of rainfall and snow in the northern states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as well as Jammu and Kashmir until Tuesday.
Avalanches and landslides are common in the higher regions of the Himalayas, especially during winter.
Experts say that climate change has made extreme weather more severe and less predictable. There has also been a rapid rise in deforestation and construction in Uttarakhand's hilly areas in recent years.
In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a piece of a Himalayan glacier fell into the river, triggering flash floods.

Headline: Ban on India's stock market 'She-Wolf' puts regulators on the spot
Author: Archana Shukla, India Business Correspondent•@archanajsr, •
Published Date: 2025-03-03T02:42:13.376Z
Text: YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to "make India trade".
The wildly popular financial influencer called herself the "She-Wolf of the stock market" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.
Last month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.
The regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.
India's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.
Many of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled "investment gurus" or "financial influencers" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.
With only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.
Most operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.
The regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.
Sebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.
The regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.
Sebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.
As markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.
Thousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals.
Sebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (£10,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (£9m) by selling courses.
Ms Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.
While Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.
The regulator has been both a "selective" and "reluctant regulator", Sucheta Dalal, veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.
"It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big."
Sumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.
"Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation," he says.
Manish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.
"Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken," Singh told the BBC.
Balancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal.
Technology is inherently disruptive and the law is always "playing catch-up". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.
"It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order," says Mr Agrawal.
A Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations.
The challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.

Headline: Afghans hiding in Pakistan live in fear of forced deportation

Text: "I'm scared," sobs Nabila.
The 10-year-old's life is limited to her one-bedroom home in Islamabad and the dirt road outside it. Since December she hasn't been to her local school, when it decided it would no longer accept Afghans without a valid Pakistani birth certificate. But even if she could go to classes, Nabila says she wouldn't.
"I was off sick one day, and I heard police came looking for Afghan children," she cries, as she tells us her friend's family were sent back to Afghanistan.
Nabila's not her real name - all the names of Afghans quoted in this article have been changed for their safety.
Pakistan's capital and the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi are witnessing a surge in deportations, arrests and detentions of Afghans, the UN says. It estimates that more than half of the three million Afghans in the country are undocumented.
Afghans describe a life of constant fear and near daily police raids on their homes.
Some told the BBC they feared being killed if they went back to Afghanistan. These include families on a US resettlement programme, that has been suspended by the Trump administration.
Pakistan is frustrated at how long relocation programmes are taking, says Philippa Candler, the UN Refugee Agency's representative in Islamabad. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) says 930 people were sent back to Afghanistan in the first half of February, double the figure two weeks earlier. At least 20% of those deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi had documentation from the UN Refugee Agency, meaning they were recognised as people in need of international protection.
But Pakistan is not a party to the Refugee Convention and has previously said it does not recognise Afghans living in the country as refugees. The government has said its policies are aimed at all illegal foreign nationals and a deadline for them to leave is looming. That date has fluctuated but is now set to 31 March for those without valid visas, and 30 June for those with resettlement letters.
Many Afghans are terrified amid the confusion. They also say the visa process can be difficult to navigate. Nabila's family believes they have only one option: to hide. Her father Hamid served in the Afghan military, before the Taliban takeover in 2021. He broke down in tears describing his sleepless nights.
"I have served my country and now I'm useless. That job has doomed me," he said.
His family are without visas, and are not on a resettlement list. They tell us their phone calls to the UN's refugee agency go unanswered.
The BBC has reached out to the agency for comment.
The Taliban government has previously told the BBC all Afghans should return because they could "live in the country without any fear". It claims these refugees are "economic migrants".
But a UN report in 2023 cast doubt on assurances from the Taliban government. It found hundreds of former government officials and armed forces members were allegedly killed despite a general amnesty.
The Taliban government's guarantees are of little reassurance to Nabila's family so they choose to run when authorities are nearby. Neighbours offer each other shelter, as they all try to avoid retuning to Afghanistan.
The UN counted 1,245 Afghans being arrested or detained in January across Pakistan, more than double the same period last year.
Nabila says Afghans shouldn't be forced out. "Don't kick Afghans out of their homes - we're not here by choice, we are forced to be here."
There is a feeling of sadness and loneliness in their home. "I had a friend who was here and then was deported to Afghanistan," Nabila's mother Maryam says.
"She was like a sister, a mother. The day we were separated was a difficult day."
I ask Nabila what she wants to do when she's older. "Modelling," she says, giving me a serious look. Everyone in the room smiles. The tension thaws.
Her mother whispers to her there are plenty of other things she could be, an engineer or a lawyer. Nabila's dream of modelling is one she could never pursue under the Taliban government. With their restrictions on girls' education, her mother's suggestions would also prove impossible.
Pakistan has a long record of taking in Afghan refugees. But cross-border attacks have surged and stoked tension between the two neighbours. Pakistan blames them on militants based in Afghanistan, which the Taliban government denies. Since September 2023, the year Pakistan launched its "Illegal Foreigners' Repatriation Plan," 836,238 individuals have now been returned to Afghanistan.
Amidst this current phase of deportations, some Afghans are being held in the Haji camp in Islamabad. Ahmad was in the final stages of the United States' resettlement programme. He tells us when President Donald Trump suspended it for review, he extinguished Ahmad's "last hope". The BBC has seen what appears to be his employment letter by a Western, Christian non-profit group in Afghanistan.
A few weeks ago, when he was out shopping, he received a call. His three-year-old daughter was on the line. "My baby called, come baba police is here, police come to our door," he says. His wife's visa extension was still pending, and she was busy pleading with the police.
Ahmad ran home. "I couldn't leave them behind." He says he sat in a van and waited hours as police continued their raids. The wives and children of his neighbours continued trickling into the vehicle. Ahmad began receiving calls from their husbands, begging him to take care of them. They had already escaped into the woods.
His family was held for three days in "unimaginable conditions", says Ahmad, who claims they were only given one blanket per family, and one piece of bread per day, and that their phones were confiscated. The Pakistani government says it ensures "no one is mistreated or harassed during the repatriation process".
We attempt to visit inside Haji camp to verify Ahmad's account but are denied entry by authorities. The BBC approached the Pakistani government and the police for an interview or statement, but no one was made available.
Scared of being detained or deported, some families have chosen to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Others tell us they simply can't afford to.
One woman claims she was in the final stages of the US resettlement scheme and decided to move with her two daughters to Attock, 80km (50 miles) west of Islamabad. "I can barely afford bread," she says.
The BBC has seen a document confirming she had an interview with the IOM in early January. She claims her family is still witnessing almost daily raids in her neighbourhood.
A spokesman for the US embassy in Islamabad has said it is in "close communication" with Pakistan's government "on the status of Afghan nationals in the US resettlement pathways".
Outside Haji camp's gates, a woman is waiting. She tells us she has a valid visa but her sister's has expired. Her sister is now being held inside the camp, along with her children. The officers would not let her visit her family, and she is terrified they will be deported. She begins weeping, "If my country was safe, why would I come here to Pakistan? And even here we cannot live peacefully."
She points to her own daughter who is sitting in their car. She was a singer in Afghanistan, where a law states women cannot be heard speaking outside their home, let alone singing. I turn to her daughter and ask if she still sings. She stares. "No."

Headline: They lost their families in a plane crash - then came the online hate
Author: Kelly Ng & Juna Moon, Reporting fromSingapore and Seoul

Text: A plane crash in South Korea last December left Park Geun-woo an orphan. The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims.
The Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.
Police investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were "thrilled" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were "fake victims" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones.
Authorities have taken down at least 427 such posts.
But this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech.
Following Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation.
People whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech.
The tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; £231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high.
"People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard," Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald.
In later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech.
Many South Koreans, he says, now "view others not as their peers, but as adversaries", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea.
"We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself," Prof Lim Myung-ho of Dankook University told the BBC. "That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself."
Mr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as "parasites squandering the nation's money".
By way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; £1,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund.
"It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted," said one such comment.
Mr Park says these comments were "overwhelming".
"Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?" he says. "Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money."
"Too many people, instead of being sensitive, build their entertainment on others' suffering," he adds. "When something like this happens, they belittle it and spew hateful remarks."
Joshua Uyheng, a psychology professor in the Philippines who studies online hate, says that hate is often "directed towards [those] we believe are gaining some advantage at our expense".
"We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick."
In the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse.
The accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country.
Many supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP.
"The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP," read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as "100% the fault" of the party.
Park Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and "fake bereaved family member". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out.
"It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair," she wrote on Threads two days after the incident.
Park Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to "enjoy taking advantage of others' pain".
"That's simply not something a human being should do," he told the BBC.
"I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death."
While there are no perfect solutions to hate, experts say social media companies should establish policies on what constitutes hate speech and moderate content posted on their platforms accordingly.
"Online users should be able to report malicious posts and comments smoothly, and platform companies must actively delete such content," Prof Koo says. Law enforcement agencies should also take perpetrators to task, he adds.
Reminding people of their shared identities may also help, says Prof Uyheng.
"The less people feel that they are on opposite ends of a zero-sum game, perhaps the more they can feel that tragedies like these are the shared concern of us all - and that victims deserve empathy and compassion, not vitriol and condemnation."

Text: At least four people have died and several others are missing after an avalanche hit the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, authorities have said.
A rescue operation has been under way after the avalanche swept away road construction workers in the village of Mana, which shares a border with Tibet, on Friday.
Some 50 people who were buried under snow and debris were rescued, but four died from their injuries, the Indian army said.
Helicopters have been deployed in the search for five people who are still unaccounted for in the Himalayan mountain state, it added.
Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said rescue teams were "continuously engaged in relief efforts" following the avalanche, which hit a Border Roads Organisation camp.
He added that the government was committed to providing all possible assistance to those affected "in this hour of crisis".
Footage posted on X on Friday by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police showed rescuers carrying people on stretchers and walking through several feet of snow - even as more snow continued to fall.
Gaurav Kunwar, a former village council member of Mana, told BBC News on Friday the area where the avalanche hit was a "migratory area" and "no-one lives there permanently".
"Only labourers working on border roads stay there in the winter," he added.
"There's also some army presence there. We've heard that it has been raining in the area for two days. The road workers were in a camp when the avalanche hit."
The India Meteorological Department warned on Friday of heavy rainfall and snow in the northern Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as well as Jammu and Kashmir.
Orange alerts were also issued for snowfall in several districts of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.

Headline: Threat to Kashmir's iconic chinar trees - and the fight to save them

Text: Was it pruning or felling?
The alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.
The chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.
The trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.
But rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.
The Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics.
"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees," says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.
The project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000–7,000 still left to be mapped.
Despite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.
This is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.
But on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.
The trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.
The Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected "pleasure gardens" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment.
The chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.
According to government literature, in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests.
Emperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.
Interestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.
But environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.
"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled," he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.
"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other," he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.
Chinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.
Government projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.
Last week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.
"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit," Mr Bhat says.
"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home."

Headline: First British tourists allowed back into North Korea tell BBC what they saw

Text: Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.
These are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.
Then there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.
"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them," says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.
North Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.
Since then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.
But after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.
Last Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.
Among them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.
Ben Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to "being on a school trip". "You can't leave the hotel without the guides," he said.
"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom," said Mike. "I've never had to do that anywhere in the world."
Despite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. "Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see."
On his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.
For now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the "big-hitting monuments" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.
Set up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.
Joe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. "I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions," he said.
Joe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.
"This was the only place people weren't expecting us," Joe said. "It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it."
But according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.
Covid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. "On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks." Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.
It is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.
Local guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.
Even Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. "Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms," he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. "It felt like they opened the doors just for us."
The regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise "the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed". His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling "his grandma's living room". The whole window was cracked.
"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.
One of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.
They knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. "I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me."
Such conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.
Mike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. "I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid," he said.
"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre."
For Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: "North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important."
But tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.
"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military," she said.
One conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. "I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim," he said.

Headline: Six killed in blast at Pakistan's 'University of Jihad'

Text: At least six people have been killed in a suicide attack at an Islamic seminary in northern Pakistan that has been described as the "University of Jihad".
The blast happened at the mosque within the Darul Uloom Haqqania, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 55km (34 miles) from the northern city of Peshawar.
Maulana Hamid ul-Haq, a prominent cleric and the influential head of the school, is among the dead. Police said more than 10 other people had been injured.
The seminary has long been associated with the Taliban since several of its members, including the group's founder Mullah Omar, trained there.
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came ahead of the start of the holy month of Ramadan.
The explosion occurred after Friday prayers, according to local police.
Haq's son, Khuzaima Sami, told the BBC that hundreds were present in the main hall at the time of the blast and that he feared there would be many casualties.
An investigation has been launched into the attack.
"Initial reports suggest the blast occurred after Friday prayers as people were gathering to greet Hamid ul-Haq," Abdul Rasheed, the district police chief, told the AFP news agency.
The seminary - where clerics are taught - also known as a madrassa, is considered one of the region's most renowned religious educational institutions and is an important academic centre of the Deoband school of thought.
It has been referred to as the "University of Jihad" due to its notable alumni, including Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the militant Haqqani Network, and his son Sirajuddin Haqqani.
Both men played key roles in leading the Taliban's insurgency, first against Soviet forces and later against US and Nato forces, in Afghanistan.
Haq, 57, was the son of the influential Pakistani cleric Maulana Sami ul-Haq, widely known as the "Father of the Taliban".
He became the seminary's vice-chancellor after his father's assassination in 2018, and the head of a faction of the religious Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-S) political party.
He also served as a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 2002 to 2007.
Haq's father had longstanding ties with the Afghan Taliban's leadership, including Mullah Omar.
He was considered an influential figure in facilitating negotiations between the Taliban and the Pakistani government.
Despite their strong connections with the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, neither Haq nor his father were directly involved in any anti-state movements.
Instead, they were often seen as intermediaries between Pakistan and the Taliban.
Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attack, as did the Pakistani Taliban.
The group described Haq as a "preacher of truth, a compassionate teacher, and a fearless advocate for the stability of madrassas".

Text: At least 25 road workers remain trapped after a massive avalanche struck a remote border area in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, officials say.
Senior district official Sandeep Tiwari told BBC Hindi that 32 workers had been rescued and moved to an army camp nearby.
The avalanche hit a Border Roads Organisation (BRO) camp in the village of Mana, which shares a border with Tibet, officials say.
Officials said rescue operations were continuing in extreme weather amid heavy snowfall.
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami wrote on X that rescue work was being carried out by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the BRO and other teams.
Ambulances and emergency teams have been dispatched, but treacherous conditions continue to pose challenges for rescuers.
Footage posted on X by ITBP showed rescuers carrying people on stretchers and walking through several feet of snow - even as more snow continued to fall.
Colonel Ankur Mahajan, a commander with the BRO, told the Hindustan Times newspaper that those who had been rescued were receiving treatment "but the extent of their injuries is unclear".
Gaurav Kunwar, a former village council member of Mana, told BBC News that details of the incident were sketchy.
"No-one lives there permanently. It's a migratory area and only labourers working on border roads stay there in the winter. There's also some army presence there. We've heard that it has been raining in the area for two days. The road workers were in a camp when the avalanche hit."
Earlier on Friday, the India Meteorological Department warned of heavy rainfall and snow in the northern Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as Jammu and Kashmir.
Orange alerts have also been issued for snowfall in several districts of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.

Headline: Japanese woman under investigation for kissing BTS's Jin

Text: A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police.
Police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space.
The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June, which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.
The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation.
On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.
During the three-hour long "hugathon", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.
But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face.
Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions.
She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him "on his neck" and "the skin was very soft".
The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts.
The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment.
Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other five - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.
K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.
But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by "sasaeng fans", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.

Headline: Five years since deadly Delhi riots, many police cases are falling apart
Author: Umang Poddar, BBC Hindi, Reporting fromDelhi

Text: Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved.
A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges.
More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs.
The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was "pre-planned" as a part of a larger conspiracy to "threaten India's unity" by the people who were protesting against the law.
They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the "main conspiracy case". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin.
BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions.
More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions.
Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial.
In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows.
A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing "predetermined chargesheets" and "falsely implicating" the accused.
In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible.
Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out.
In two orders, the judge said that he could not "restrain" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the "failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation" would "torment the sentinels of democracy". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any "real or effective investigation".
The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a "credible, fair and impartial" way.
Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation.
Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots.
He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others.
Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson.
"Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van," he told the BBC.
When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting.
"They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims," Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries.
In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin.
In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been "artificially prepared", and that "in all probabilities" the shop was burnt by a "mob of persons from the Hindu community".
It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened.
Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed.
"All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy," said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father.
"In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence."
He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. "If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them," he added.
In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots.
The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client.
In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up.
In its order in January, the court ruled that the police "manipulated" the video to "frame" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the "actual culprits".
It also asked the commissioner of Delhi police to take appropriate action against the investigating officer in the case. The police did not respond to BBC Hindi's question on whether this had been done.
Mr Bhati, who spent four months in prison, refused to comment, saying he did not wish to discuss his "ordeal".
With so many acquittals, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said, the prosecution and police "should sit down to introspect what they have achieved in five years".
He also said that "accountability needs to be fixed on the prosecution as well if the arrest is found to be illegal or unnecessary".
"If the prosecution puts someone in jail because they have the power to do so or because they want to do so, they should not be allowed to get away with it if the incarceration is found to be illegal or unnecessary," he added.
Even as some cases fall apart in courts, many of those arrested are still languishing in jail awaiting a trial.
Gulfisha Fatima, a 33-year-old PhD aspirant, is among 12 activists who are still in jail on charges of being "conspirators" of the riots.
Her family said three other police cases were lodged against her and she got bail in all of them. But she continues to face incarceration in a fourth case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) - the stringent anti-terror law that sets exceptionally challenging conditions for bail.
"Since she's gone to jail, with every hearing we hope she will finally come out," her father Syed Tasneef Hussain told the BBC.
In Ms Fatima's case, after months of hearing the bail plea, the judge from the Delhi High Court got transferred in 2023, and now the entire case is being heard again.
"Sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to see her or if I'll die before that," Mr Hussain said.

Headline: Thailand deports dozens of Uyghurs to China
Author: Laura Bicker and Kathryn Armstrong, Beijing and London
Published Date: 2025-02-27T20:14:46.940Z
Text: At least 40 Uyghurs have been deported to China,Thai authorities have confirmed, despite warnings from rights groups they could face possible torture and even death.
The group is thought to have been flown back to China's Xinjiang region on Thursday, after being held for 10 years in a Bangkok detention centre.
China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations.
It is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015.
The deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations.
Thai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Hours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported.
The Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past.
Eight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention.
The government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country.
She did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday.
"In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights," Shinawatra said.
Beijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs.
"The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice," the foreign ministry said.
Chinese state media said the group had been "bewitched" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country.
The returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang.
Many were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.
"What is the Thai government doing?" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday.
"There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long."
The detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody.
In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment.
"Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws," said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson.
"Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials."
Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations "totally destroyed" the "charade" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one "when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours".
Amnesty International described the deportations as "unimaginably cruel".
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged "all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China."
He accused China of having "committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang" in a statement published online.
The UN said it "deeply regrets" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU.
Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees "in the strongest terms" with Thailand's decision.
There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).
The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.
Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.
China has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.

Headline: Inside the Taliban's surveillance network monitoring millions

Text: In a crowded control centre, surrounded by dozens of TV screens, the Taliban's police force proudly shows off its newly-acquired network of 90,000 CCTV cameras - used to watch over the day-to-day lives of millions of people.
"We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here," says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens.
The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law.
The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action.
Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul.
From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored.
"In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police," says Zadran.
"They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering."
Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime.
The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power.
However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.
The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask.
"On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away," says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction.
The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within.
The interior ministry says the cameras have "significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures.
However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long.
Amnesty International say installing cameras "under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces".
By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes.
While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering.
Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is "significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]".
The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry – the Taliban's morality police - does not use it.
But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule.
"Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy," she says.
"There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too," she says.
Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used.
The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they "are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge".
The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment.
Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system.
In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home.
"They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household," she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; £54) a month.
The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power.
According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid.
"If families refused to pay [for the cameras], they were threatened with water and power cuts within three days," Shella adds. "We had to take loans to cover the costs.
"People are starving - what good are these cameras to them?"
The Taliban say that if people do not want to contribute, they can put in an official complaint.
"Participation was voluntary, and donations were in the hundreds, not thousands," Khalid Zadran, the Taliban police spokesperson, insists.
Despite the assurances, rights campaigners both inside and outside Afghanistan continue to have concerns over how such a powerful surveillance system will be used.
Jaber, a vegetable seller in Kabul, says the cameras represent another way in which Afghans are made to feel powerless.
"We are treated like trash, denied the opportunity to earn a living, and the authorities regard us as worthless," he told the BBC.
"We can do nothing."

Headline: 'I need help': Freed from Myanmar's scam centres, thousands are now stranded
Author: Jonathan Head, Lulu Luo and Thanyarat Doksone, BBC News, Reporting fromMae Sot, Thai-Myanmar border
Published Date: 2025-02-26T22:34:29.906Z
Text: "I swear to God I need help," said the man quietly on the other end of the line.
The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand.
They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.
But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.
The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people – more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.
The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.
He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.
Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.
Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.
"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people."
Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.
Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.
China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.
Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.
He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.
"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us."
Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.
He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.
The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.
It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.
That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.
The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.
Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.
Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.
A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.
The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.
The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.
Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.
Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.
"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it – we must work seriously," said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.
"Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill," says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.
"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough."
Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.
But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.
Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave.
On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital.
"I just want to go home," he said over the phone. "I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking."

Headline: Did Iron Age 'begin' in India? Tamil Nadu dig sparks debate
Author: Soutik Biswas, India correspondent•@soutikBBC, •
Published Date: 2025-02-26T22:32:33.838Z
Text: For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.
Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.
Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.
Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953–3,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent.
"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in," says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.
The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as "Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.
Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions. He believes that iron technology likely emerged "independently in multiple regions".
Also, the "earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly".
If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, "it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find "suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world".
Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.
Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.
Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.
At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.
Some finds are particularly striking.
Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th–15th Century BC.
This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.
"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier," he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there "were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time".
Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community.
The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.
To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years," archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me.
"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently," says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.
"What's clear now," she adds, "is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent."
Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, "what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation," notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.
However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, "Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu."
Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was "just the starting point".
"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began."

Headline: Rape case filed against Domino's Pizza franchise owner in India

Text: Indian police have registered a case against leading businessman Shyam S Bhartia and three others for alleged criminal intimidation and rape of an aspiring Bollywood actress.
Bhartia is the founder and chairman of Jubilant Bhartia Group. Its subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks is the largest franchisee for Domino's Pizza outside of the US.
The woman, who can't be named under Indian law, accuses Bhartia of intoxicating and then "brutally" raping her in Singapore.
Bhartia has denied the allegations as "baseless, false and disparaging" in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
The company said Bhartia would fully cooperate with the investigation.
Jubiliant FoodWorks has not responded separately to the BBC's request for comment.
The woman said she first complained to the police on 11 November 2024. But her case was registered only on 22 February on orders of the Bombay High Court after it heard her petition.
The petition and the police complaint seen by the BBC alleged that the woman first met Bhartia in 2022 at a five star hotel in Mumbai through a co-accused, who allegedly promised to introduce her to people who could help further her career in the entertainment industry.
She alleges that Bhartia agreed to invest in her film project and asked her to come to Singapore, giving her his credit card details to book flight tickets.
In the petition, the woman also alleged that the co-accused made a video of the rape in Singapore in 2023.
She further alleged that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Bhartia thereafter that year.
In the company's filing with the stock exchange, Jubiliant FoodWorks said the court had made it clear it had not gone into the "merits of the complaint". It rubbished the allegations against Bhartia saying they were made with a "clear mala fide intent against him".

Headline: Indian doctors remove teen's 'parasitic' twin in rare surgery
Author: Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai
Published Date: 2025-02-26T08:51:28.978Z
Text: Doctors in the Indian capital, Delhi, have performed a life-changing surgery on a 17-year-old boy to remove his "parasitic" twin that was attached to his abdomen.
A parasitic twin is an underdeveloped conjoined twin that relies entirely on the host twin for survival.
They are extremely rare, with less than one case occurring per 100,000 births.
The teenager who had a fully developed extra set of limbs and a pelvis - sustained by a chest artery - underwent a two-hour surgery at Aiims hospital in Delhi.
Dr Asuri Krishna, who led the team of specialists, said the surgery was particularly challenging because of the patient's age.
"Only 40-50 cases of parasitic twins have been documented in world medical literature and, in those cases, the surgery had been attempted on children," Dr Krishna told the BBC.
With insufficient medical literature to guide them, the team had to rely on their "intuition, skill and knowledge", he added.
Parasitic twins form when one foetus partially develops while attached to the other.
In this case, the teenager had two fully formed legs, buttocks and external genitalia - weighing nearly 15kg - protruding from his abdomen.
Remarkably, the parasitic limbs could feel pain, touch and change in temperature.
Dr Krishna said the first thing they did was identify how interconnected the parasitic and host twins were.
Through scans, the doctors found out that the parasitic twin was attached to the teen's breastbone and was being supplied blood from a vessel in his chest.
"But there wasn't much connection with other main organs like the liver or kidneys," Dr Krishna said, adding that they also found a large cyst in the teen's abdomen.
The surgery was done in two stages - first, removing the parasitic twin, then extracting the cystic mass from surrounding organs.
A team of doctors, including radiologists, anaesthetists and plastic surgeons, completed the procedure in two-and-a-half hours.
"A mesh of shared blood vessels, nerves and tissues had to be separated. Care had to be taken to see that none of the host's organs or tissues were damaged," Dr Krishna said.
During surgery, the teen's blood pressure dropped dangerously as 30-40% of his blood flowed to the parasitic twin. But the doctors said they were prepared for it and swiftly stabilised him.
The teen was discharged four days after being admitted. He is healthy and has suffered no complications from the surgery, Dr Krishna says.
The teenager's unusual appearance made him the subject of gossip and ridicule in his neighbourhood in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. The stares and jokes took a toll on his mental health, leaving him feeling isolated and lonely.
"I couldn't travel anywhere or do any physical activity," he told the Indian Express newspaper, adding that he had dropped out of school in the eighth grade.
The 17-year-old told the Express that he was ecstatic and now wanted to live an active life.
"I hope to study and get a job. A new world has opened up to me," he said.

Headline: Chinese foodies pose as mourners to try funeral home's noodles

Text: Foodies in China have been reportedly flocking to an unlikely destination - a funeral home - after a noodle dish served at its canteen went viral on social media.
The dish is found at the Erlong Funeral Home in the southwestern province of Guizhou.
The canteen caters to the funeral home's customers, but as word began to spread about its noodles, hordes of diners - some posing as mourners - began showing up to try the food.
Erlong has since announced it will allow some members of the public to eat at its premises, as long as they do not disturb genuine mourners.
The funeral home offers various types of noodle dishes during breakfast and supper hours, which cost 10 yuan per bowl ($1.38; £1.09).
The most popular type is reportedly the noodles topped with minced pork and peanuts.
One Erlong worker told Jiupai News that they "only served customers who come to the funeral home to handle matters".
But other people have been sneaking in to get a bowl of noodles, the worker said, adding that sometimes queues at Erlong are so long that diners sometimes have to wait a couple of hours to get their food.
"There have been people pretending to be relatives of the deceased, it's hard to tell them apart when it gets crowded, and it's hard to manage," he said.
To meet the demand, the funeral home has since decided to offer 50 bowls of noodles to members of the public every day - for free - as long as "they do not affect people's mourning", according to Erlong's chef in an interview with local media.
While the noodle dish was already popular among locals, the craze appeared to have ramped up earlier this month when a social media user posted about the dish while visiting a friend in Guizhou, which is known for its spicy and sour dishes.
"My friend says the food at this funeral home is so good," they wrote earlier this month on Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. "The queue for food is longer than the queue to lay flowers for the deceased."
"I didn't get to eat the noodles, because my friend's mum didn't know anyone who was holding a funeral service."
Since then, many Chinese social media users have also shared their experiences eating the noodles.
On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, one user shared a photo of the dining hall's tickets, with what appeared to be a crowd queuing up for food.
"I heard the noodles here were very good," they wrote. "I thought about how short life was, and got another bowl."

Headline: Billion Indians have no spending money - report
Author: Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Mumbai, @Nik_inamdar
Published Date: 2025-02-25T22:21:51.477Z
Text: India is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates.
The country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm.
Another 300 million are "emerging" or "aspirant" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact.
What is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not "widening" as much as it is "deepening", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.
All of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of "premiumisation" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings.
This is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the "experience economy" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes.
Companies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. "Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share."
The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.
In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.
The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses.
The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.
Much of the consumption spending of the "emerging" or "aspirant" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and "turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption", says Pai.
In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be "dramatic" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai.
But major longer-term headwinds remain.
India's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers.
"The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation]," says the report, published in January.
"This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead," it adds.
The Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. "The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly," it adds.
The government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well.
It says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption.
"India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course," the survey says.

Headline: Myanmar villagers reveal 'desperate' illegal kidney sales
Author: BBC Burmese
Published Date: 2025-02-25T22:15:53.746Z
Text: "I just wanted to own a house and pay off my debts - that's why I decided to sell my kidney," says Zeya, a farm worker in Myanmar.
Prices had soared after a military coup in 2021 triggered civil war. He could barely feed his young family and was badly in debt.
They all lived in his mother-in-law's house, in a village where thatched houses lined dirt roads, a few hours' drive from the country's largest city, Yangon.
Zeya, whose name has been changed to conceal his identity, knew of local people who had sold one of their kidneys. "They looked healthy to me," he says. So he started asking around.
He is one of eight people in the area who told BBC Burmese they had sold a kidney by travelling to India.
Illegal organ trading is a problem across Asia, and Zeya's story gives an insight into how it takes place.
Buying or selling human organs is illegal in both Myanmar and India, but Zeya says he soon found a man he describes as a "broker".
He says the man arranged medical tests and, a few weeks later, told him a potential recipient - a Burmese woman - had been found, and that both of them could travel to India for the surgery.
In India, if the donor and recipient are not close relatives, they must demonstrate that the motive is altruistic and explain the relationship between them.
Zeya says the broker forged a document, which every household in Myanmar must have, listing the details of family members.
"The broker put my name in the recipient's family tree," he explains.
He says the broker made it appear as if he was donating to someone he was related to by marriage: "Someone who is not a blood relative, but a distant relative".
Then, he says, the broker took him to meet the recipient in Yangon. There, he says a man who introduced himself as a doctor completed more paperwork and warned Zeya he would have to pay a substantial fee if he backed out.
The BBC contacted this man afterwards, who said his role was to check whether a patient was fit to undergo the procedure, not to check the relationship between donor and recipient.
Zeya says he was told he would receive 7.5m Myanmar kyats. This has been worth somewhere between $1,700 and $2,700 over the past couple of years - the unofficial exchange rate has fluctuated since the coup.
He says he flew to northern India for the operation and it took place in a large hospital.
All transplants involving foreign nationals in India must be approved by a panel called an authorisation committee, established either by the hospital or by local government.
Zeya says he was interviewed, via a translator, by about four people.
"They asked me if I was willingly donating my kidney to her, not by force," he says.
He says he explained the recipient was a relative and the transplant was approved.
Zeya remembers the doctors administering the anaesthetic before he lost consciousness.
"There were no big issues after the surgery, except that I couldn't move without pain," he says, adding that he stayed in hospital for a week afterwards.
Another donor, Myo Win - also not his real name - told the BBC he too had pretended to be related to a stranger.
"The broker gave me a piece of paper, and I had to memorise what was written on it," he says, adding that he was told to say the recipient was married to one of his relatives.
"The person assessing my case also called my mum, but the broker arranged a fake mum for the call," he says. He adds that the person who answered the call confirmed he was donating his kidney to a relative with her permission.
Myo Win says he was offered the same amount of money as Zeya, but that it was described as a "charitable donation", and he had to pay the broker about 10% of the amount.
Both men say they were given a third of the money up front. Myo Win says this was in his thoughts as he entered the operating theatre: "I made up my mind that I had to do it because I had already taken their money."
He adds that he "chose this desperate way" as he was struggling with debt and medical bills for his wife.
Unemployment rates have climbed in Myanmar since the coup - the war has ravaged the economy and sent foreign investors fleeing. In 2017, a quarter of the population were living in poverty - but by 2023, this had risen to half, according to the UN's development agency, UNDP.
Myo Win says the broker did not tell him selling his kidney was illegal. "I wouldn't have done it if he did. I am afraid of ending up in prison," he says.
The BBC is not naming any of organisations or individuals involved in order to protect the anonymity and safety of the interviewees.
However, another man in Myanmar, also speaking anonymously, told the BBC he had helped about 10 people buy or sell kidneys via surgery in India.
He said he referred people to an "agency" in Mandalay in central Myanmar, which he said made arrangements.
"But don't worry about donors," he said. "We have a list of donors who are queuing up to donate their kidneys."
He too said documents were faked to label strangers as related by marriage. When asked whether he received money for his help, he did not answer.
Organ transplants have increased by more than 50% worldwide since 2010, with about 150,000 carried out annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But it says the supply of organs meets only about 10% of global need.
Trading in human body parts is illegal in nearly all countries and is hard to measure. In 2007, the WHO estimated that 5-10% of transplanted organs came from the black market, but the figure may be higher.
Illegal kidney sales driven by poverty have been documented in recent years across Asia, including in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Afghanistan, India and Bangladesh.
India has long been a hub for medical tourism and concern there about kidney sales has been rising, following accounts in media reports and a recent police investigation.
Last July, Indian police said they had arrested seven people in connection with an alleged kidney racket, including an Indian doctor and her assistant.
Police allege the group arranged for poor Bangladeshis to sell their kidneys, using forged documents to secure approval for the transplants.
Dr Vijaya Rajakumari, who had been working at the prestigious Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi, is alleged to have carried out the operations as a visiting consultant at a different hospital, Yatharth, a few kilometres away.
Her lawyer told the BBC the allegations "are entirely baseless and without evidence", that she only carried out surgeries approved by authorisation committees and always acted in accordance with the law. According to her bail order, she is not accused of preparing forged documents.
Yatharth Hospital told the BBC all its cases, including those managed by visiting consultants, "are subject to our robust protocols to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards".
"We have further enhanced our processes to prevent any such occurrences in the future," the hospital said.
After her arrest, Apollo Hospitals said Dr Rajakumari was a freelance consultant engaged on a fee-for-service basis and it had discontinued all clinical engagements with her.
Dr Rajakumari has not been charged in court.
Last April, a senior health ministry official wrote to Indian states warning of a "surge" in transplants involving foreigners and calling for better monitoring.
Under Indian law, foreign nationals who wish to donate or receive organs must have their documents, including those showing the relationship between donor and recipient, verified by their own country's embassy in India.
The BBC contacted India's heath ministry and the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization, as well as Myanmar's military government for comment, but has received no response.
A public health campaigner in Myanmar, Dr Thurein Hlaing Win, said: "Law enforcement is not effective."
He added that potential donors need to be aware of the risks, including of bleeding during surgery and damage to other organs, adding that proper follow-up care is needed.
The BBC last heard from Zeya several months after his surgery.
"I was able to settle my debts and bought a plot of land," he said.
But he said he couldn't afford to build a house and had not been able to construct one while recovering from the surgery. He said he had been suffering from back pain.
"I have to restart working soon. If the side effects strike again, I have to deal with it. I have no regrets about it," he added.
He said he stayed in touch with the recipient for a while, and she had told him she was in good health with his kidney.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, she told the BBC she paid 100m kyats (between around $22,000 and $35,000 in recent years) in total. She denied that documents were forged, maintaining that Zeya was her relative.
Six months after his surgery, Myo Win told the BBC he had paid off most of his debts, but not all.
"I have no job and not even a penny left," he said, adding that he had been experiencing some stomach problems since the surgery.
He said he had no regrets, but then added: "I am telling other people not to do this. It is not good."

Headline: Race against time to save eight Indian workers trapped inside tunnel

Text: Authorities in the southern Indian state of Telangana are racing against time to save eight construction workers trapped inside a tunnel for more than 72 hours.
Around 50 workers had been working inside the 43km (26.7-mile)-long tunnel, located in Nagarkurnool district, when a part of its roof caved in early Saturday morning.
Officials say 43 of them managed to come out safely but efforts to reach the remaining eight men have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil, mud and slush inside the tunnel.
They have also been unable to establish contact with the trapped men, or provide them with oxygen and other essential supplies.
Jupally Krishna Rao, a state minister overseeing the rescue effort, told PTI news agency that "the chances of their survival are very remote."
On Monday an expert team of "rat-hole miners" - people trained in narrow tunnel navigation - arrived to clear the debris and get to the workers. The same team had sucessfully rescued 41 construction workers trapped in a tunnel after a landslide in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in 2023.
Approximately 33km of excavation has been completed so far and roughly 10km remain, officials said on Tuesday.
Rescuers are using a train to get to a point from where they need to climb on to a conveyor belt to remove the debris. Reports say they are also continuously pumping out water to ensure oxygen supply within the tunnel. But the rough terrain of the region has slowed them down.
As rescue efforts continue, families of the trapped workers - most of whom are daily wage workers - are anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones.
"I just hope that this time my son comes back safe. I will never send him away to earn again," said Rampratap Sahu, a resident of Jharkhand state.
Others expressed anger at authorities for letting their family members "come in harm's way".
"Why did they send the men to work there when they knew of the risks involved in the project?" asked Jaspreet Kaur, whose brother is among those trapped.
A portion of the under-construction Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed around 13km from its opening at 8:30 local time (03:00 GMT) on Saturday.
The accident took place after a slab of concrete covering seepage on the roof slipped and fell off. At least a dozen workers were injured in the chaos.
The tunnel is part of the longest-running irrigation project of the Telangana government. Located in a hilly forested area, it passes through the Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam tiger reserve which is the largest in India.
Officials said construction work had resumed just four days before the accident, after a gap of almost three years.
Various relief teams, including personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, firefighters and soldiers from the Indian army, are at the spot.
Officials told BBC Telugu that a team of firefighters was the first to go inside on Sunday.
"We covered 11km by train, 2km by conveyor belt and the remaining distance on foot," an official, who wanted to stay anonymous, said. "But then we hit a roadblock."
"There were tall mounds of mud and soft soil. The boring machine that was being used by the workers lay upside down, blocking all passage beyond."
The rescuers said they were forced to return from that point as they did not have the necessary tools and machines to clear the slush.
"We shouted and screamed, whistled and pointed torches, hoping for a response but didn't hear anything."
Relatives of some of the trapped men are now desperately hoping for a miracle.
"When I left home, my wife held me, wept and said, do not come back empty handed. Bring back my son," said Rampratap Sahu, father of one of the workers.
"But what can I do? I can only sit here and pray to god to return my son to me. I want nothing else."

Headline: Bangladesh wooed by China as ties with India fray
Author: Ethirajan Anbarasan, BBC World Service, South Asia editor, Reporting fromLondon

Text: A 22-member Bangladeshi delegation of political leaders, civil society activists, academics and journalists have begun a 10-day visit to China.
They will be having talks with Chinese government officials and senior members of the ruling Communist Party, a delegation leader confirmed with the BBC.
Analysts say China is making overtures while diplomatic tensions have risen between Bangladesh and India on a range of issues.
This includes ousted Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina living in exile in India. Dhaka has requested her extradition but Delhi has refused.
Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior official from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) who's leading the delegation in Beijing, told the BBC: "It's basically a goodwill visit, initiated by Beijing."
"It is unique because China this time has invited a team representing various groups in Bangladesh."
Many of the delegation members are from the BNP and its allies. The BNP, headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, is one of the main parties in Bangladesh, besides the Awami League led by Hasina.
The delegation also includes several representatives from the student movement that began the mass uprising against Hasina that eventually ousted the prime minister in August last year.
An interim government led by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is currently in charge.
It has been urging India to repatriate Hasina to face charges of crimes against humanity and money laundering, among other allegations. The UN says Hasina's government's crackdown on protesters during the uprising killed about 1,400 people.
So far India has showed no sign of extraditing Hasina, who denies the charges.
Delhi and Dhaka had maintained close ties during the 15-year rule of Ms Hasina, who was widely seen by her critics as pro-India, although she also balanced it with her relationship with Beijing.
Following the fall of Hasina, Beijing has stepped up its interaction with Bangladeshi leaders, activists and delegations, including those from Islamist parties.
This week's visit follows a meeting between the Bangladesh interim government's foreign policy advisor Touhid Hossain and the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing in January.
It also marks the second time BNP officials have visited China in recent months, after Beijing hosted a BNP delegation late last year.
With the political vacuum and absence of India's influence, analysts say, Beijing is trying to increase its foothold in Bangladesh, a country of about 170 million people.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner with bilateral trade amounting to around $24bn (£19bn) - the vast majority of that consists of Chinese exports to the South Asian country.
The Bangladeshi military also heavily relies on Chinese equipment and ammunition with more than 70% of supplies coming from China.
Compared to Beijing's overtures, India has had very limited interactions with the interim government and other Bangladeshi political leaders in the past six months.
The BNP held a protest in December alleging India's interference in Bangladesh's internal matters by hosting Hasina. Some advisors of the interim government have also criticised Delhi on the same issue.
This criticism has sparked sharp reaction from Delhi.
The Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said last week that it was up to Bangladesh to decide on "what kind of relationship they want with us".
He described the criticism of India by Bangladeshi officials and politicians as "absolutely ridiculous".
Some argue that this increasingly tense rhetoric between Dhaka and Delhi could push Bangladesh towards China.
The latest events indicate that Bangladesh has joined fellow South Asian countries Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Nepal as a target for both Delhi and Beijing, as the superpowers jostle for influence.
"I don't believe India should consider the whole subcontinent is under Delhi's sphere of influence. That attitude would make India suffer," Chinese analyst Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Beijing's Tsinghua University, told the BBC.

Headline: Is India v Pakistan still cricket's greatest rivalry?
Author: Soutik Biswas, India correspondent•@soutikBBC, •

Text: Roaring crowds, faces painted blue and green, flags waving like battle standards.
This is the opening of The Greatest Rivalry: India v Pakistan, a new Netflix documentary on one of cricket's most storied contests.
India's Virender Sehwag sets the tone: "This is a contest bigger than one between the bat and ball". Cut to dramatic footage of some of the matches, the Wagah border, partition refugees. A nation split into two, but forever bound by cricket.
Pakistan's Waqar Younis doesn't hesitate: "I put this rivalry right at the top. There's no match like India v Pakistan." India's R Ashwin agrees: "I think this is bigger than the Ashes." Ramiz Raja says it's "the political garnish that makes this rivalry world-class".
Despite wars, border standoffs and terror attacks, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has endured, driven by history and national pride. Even when politics halts the bilateral series, International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments keep the fire alive, turning every match into a high-stakes spectacle.
But Pakistan's crushing defeat by India on Sunday at the Champions Trophy has reignited the question: is this rivalry overhyped, propped up by slogans like "war minus the shooting" - a phrase George Orwell coined in 1945 to criticise excessive nationalism in sports?
Is this still the premier clash in cricket, or just one of its most dramatic? Has it lost its competitive edge, running more on history than intensity?
Consider this. From an eight-wicket thrashing in 2018 to a 228-run demolition in 2023, India has dominated, winning six of the last eight ODIs. Pakistan's last victory? The 2017 Champions Trophy final - a fading memory in an increasingly one-sided rivalry.
What rivalry, asked Dawn - a leading Pakistani newspaper - pointedly after the latest debacle. A cricket war that's now just a big yawn, headlined India Today magazine.
The loss would be easier to accept if Pakistan were at least putting up a fight, according to Dawn's Zohaib Ahmed Majeed.
Majeed believes the troubled politics between the two neighbours is the only thing that has kept the rivalry alive.
"In a way we must thank the politicians of these two nations for keeping this rivalry alive, because the cricketers, especially from our side, are certainly incapable of putting up a show that is worthy of its billing," he wrote.
"Cut out the war of words and the actual wars and what you'll be left with is a professional cricketing unit against a haphazardly put together team at the last minute. There is no rivalry as far as pure cricketing merits are concerned."
India Today was no less acerbic. "With its history of one-sided losses to India in recent years, Pakistan cricket is fast sliding into pity territory. And unless it reverses the trend, Pakistan's dream of competing with India could soon turn into a butt of jokes for cricket fans," wrote Sandipan Sharma.
To be true, Pakistan's cricketing woes keep mounting. They have missed the final four in the last three ODI World Cups, crashed out in the T20 World Cup group stage and now, as hosts of the Champions Trophy, they've hit rock-bottom.
Since the 2009 attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, Pakistan cricket has battled isolation, political turmoil, board instability, frequent coaching changes and selection controversies - all adding to its struggles. Meanwhile, across the border, India has risen as cricket's powerhouse, backed by a strong domestic system and the IPL, cricket's richest international league.
Pakistani cricket writer Osman Samiuddin also notes a sense of "marginalisation" among his country's cricketers, who remain excluded from the IPL and its franchise ecosystem (no Pakistani player has featured in the IPL since 2009, as they were banned after the Mumbai terror attacks). "I think they see Indian cricketers and others as well, like Australian and English cricketers, as partaking in a world of cricket they have been excluded from," he told a programme.
This has all contributed to the team's fast-declining fortunes.
"It is a futile exercise to wonder if this is the lowest Pakistan cricket has ever been. However, even when Pakistan have plummeted to spectacular lows in the past, they have done it in a way that justifies the cliché of their mercurial nature," wrote Sidharth Monga in ESPNcricinfo, after Sunday's game.
"This slide just feels like a terminal, slow decline. Players are not fighting with each other, there is no backdoor intrigue, there are no cliques in the team plotting to dethrone the captain, there are no comical run-outs or misfields, no defeats snatched from the jaws of victory."
The "war without guns" narrative once held weight, especially when Imran Khan's Pakistan, armed with a fearsome pace attack of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and batting stars like Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul-Haq, regularly got the better of India.
"The narrative may have been true till the early 2000s because this is how the actual fans felt. But it was soon hijacked by the multinationals and the media to cash in on the hyper-pathos of it all," Nadeem Farooq Paracha, Pakistani author and columnist, told me.
"The quality of cricket between the two sides isn't the same anymore. Indian cricket continues to get better. In fact, I think the narrative in question here has ended up pressuring Pakistani side more. They underplay it, even though they're more than willing to pocket its financial benefits."
The cricket boards and broadcasters are doing all they can to keep the rivalry alive, and the ICC won't dial down the hype - it's too valuable in an era of overexposure of cricket, limited stars and competition from franchise cricket.
This one game has become a financial juggernaut, fuelling a parallel economy wherever it's played - Dubai, London, Ahmedabad - drawing fans who spend big just to be there. "Pakistan has talent, but the contest now feels more psychological," says cricket writer Gautam Bhattacharyya.
Brand consultant Santosh Desai feels the real contest between the arch rivals plays out beyond the cricket ground and the "rivalry thrives more in imagination than in reality".
"The asymmetry [between the two sides] only fuels the hype. India's dominance makes it an easy narrative to sell, a battle royale where the outcome feels preordained. If Pakistan were winning consistently, the marketing appeal would fade. The rivalry's commercial power lies in India's superiority, feeding a script designed for validation, not uncertainty," Desai told me.
India's vice-captain Shubman Gill dismisses talk of overhyping, calling it a contest fans love to watch. "It is an exciting contest when both of these teams play. Everyone enjoys watching it. If so many people are happy to watch the match, then who are we to say that it is underhyped or overhyped," he told reporters on eve of Sunday's game.
Gill is possibly right. Tickets for India-Pakistan games still fly off the shelves - the ICC reported sellouts within minutes. An astonishing 600 plus million viewers tuned in to watch Sunday's match on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar, setting new records.
But for now, as cricket writer Ayaz Memon puts it, "the hype is more thrilling than the cricket itself".

Headline: Taliban says it will try to release British couple as soon as possible

Text: The Taliban has told the BBC it will endeavour to release two British nationals who have been arrested and held in Afghanistan "as soon as possible".
Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were arrested on 1 February while returning to their home in the country's Bamiyan province.
An American national and an Afghan were also arrested alongside the couple, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs said.
The UK Foreign Office said on Monday it was supporting their family.
In a statement, Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: "A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible."
All three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards, he added.
The reason for Mr and Mrs Reynolds's arrest has not been confirmed.
The couple had been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years, including one that involved training mothers and children.
Their work had apparently been approved by the local authorities, despite the Taliban banning education for girls over the age of 12 and not allowing women to work.
The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 2022. Last December, it said it would close any NGOs employing women.
The pair married in Kabul in 1970. They remained in Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, which saw most westerners leave the country.
Their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks.
They had communicated by text after the pair were initially arrested, but contact stopped after three days.
Ms Entwistle and her siblings wrote to the Taliban to plead for their parents' release.
"We recognise that there have been instances where exchanges have been beneficial for your government and western nations," they wrote.
"However, our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded."
On Monday, Ms Entwistle said they had wanted to give the Taliban an opportunity "to explain their reasons," because Mr and Mrs Reynolds had "always sought to honour" the group.
But she said they could no longer wait, telling Times Radio: "We are now urgently calling on the British consulate to do everything in their power to get us answers and to put as much pressure as they can on the Taliban for their release".
The UK shut its embassy in Kabul and withdrew its diplomats from the country after the Taliban returned to power.
The Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore "severely limited" and advises against all travel to the country.

Headline: UK and India relaunch trade talks in Delhi
Author: Nikita Yadav, BBC News, Delhi
Published Date: 2025-02-24T10:54:25.356Z
Text: India and the UK have restarted free trade talks, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries.
Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, met his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Monday and kicked off the two-day discussions.
The talks focused on "advancing" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was "balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial", Goyal wrote on X.
The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach.
Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK.
Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a "top priority" for his government.
"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market," he said in a statement ahead of the meeting.
India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years.
The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised.
For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to impose reciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffs on imported goods from countries, including India.
The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30.
The UK had announced in November last year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year.
The two countries share a trade relationship worth £41bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries.
London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars.
India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times.
It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits.
Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions.
"India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations," he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a "separate issue" from immigration.
During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram.
UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru.
After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.
It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year.

Headline: NZ minister resigns after he 'placed hand' on staff's arm
Author: Koh Ewe, Reporting fromSingapore, Kathryn Armstrong, Reporting fromLondon

Text: New Zealand's commerce minister Andrew Bayly has resigned as a government minister after he "placed a hand" on a staff member's upper arm last week, in what he described as "overbearing" behaviour.
Bayly said on Monday that he was "deeply sorry" about the incident, which he described as not an argument but an "animated discussion".
He remains a member of parliament.
His resignation comes after he was criticised last October for calling a winery worker a "loser"- including putting his fingers in an 'L' shape on his forehead - and allegedly using an expletive directed at them. He later issued a public apology.
"As many of you know, I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios," Bayly said in a statement announcing his resignation.
"Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate."
He said a complaint had been made but would not elaborate further on exactly what had happened.
Bayly resigned last Friday, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon later told a press conference, adding that the incident happened three days earlier, on 18 February.
Luxon said on Monday the government's handling the issue within a week was "pretty quick" and "pretty impressive". He denied that he should have asked Bayly to step down following October's winery incident, and said "never say never" when asked if there was a way back for the 63-year-old into another cabinet position.
However, Labour leader Chris Hipkins criticised Luxon as being "incredibly weak", saying the incident with the staff member should not have been dragged over the weekend.
"Christopher Luxon has once again set the bar for ministerial behaviour so low, that it would be almost impossible not to get over it," he told reporters on Monday.
Bayly himself said that he had to talk to his family and "would have had difficulty" speaking to the media earlier.
He was first elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 2014 as an MP for the current ruling National Party. He was appointed the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Small Business and Manufacturing, and Minister of Statistics following Luxon's election in late 2023.
He was also appointed minister for the ACC - the national accidental injury compensation scheme - following a cabinet reshuffle earlier this year. Before joining politics, Bayly worked in the finance industry.
Luxon said Scott Simpson, National's senior whip, would take over the ACC and Commerce and Consumer Affairs portfolios.
Bayly is the first minister to resign of his own accord under PM Luxon, whose favourability has dipped considerably, according to recent polls. Both the 1News-Verian poll and the Post/Freshwater Strategy poll show his National-led coalition government is losing support among voters.
The government has recently come under fire for some policies that were seen by some as anti-Māori, including the introduction of a bill that many argued undermined Māori rights and the dissolution of the Māori Health Authority - which was set up under the last Labour government to try and create greater health equality.

Headline: Why a mega river-linking plan has sparked massive protests in India
Author: Vishnukant Tiwari, BBC Hindi
Published Date: 2025-02-24T02:15:32.226Z
Text: Thousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods.
The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; £4.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam.
It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India's National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year.
The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment.
The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy.
But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say.
"Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore," said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project.
Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living.
Environmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009.
This could undo years of conservation efforts. "It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before," says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar.
In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin.
Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations.
A 2023 study published in the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours "may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive".
Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project.
"We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well," he said.
The government official admitted that there would be a potential "challenge" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that "the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts".
The assurances have done little to comfort the villagers.
In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song.
"Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us," they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish.
The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity.
The bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power.
"We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?" Mahesh Adivasi said.
The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; £6,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given.
Mr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. "In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers," he added.
But locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees.
"Can a house be built with this much money?" he asked.
Others complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future.
"The project should have been a blessing for our village but, the truth is, it will plunge us further into darkness," said Lakshmi Adivasi, 20.
Questions have also been raised against the claim that the project is meant to channel excess water from the Ken river.
Critics point out that the government has relied on outdated data from 2003, without independent verification, to calculate the river's annual yield.
Mr Thakur denied the allegation and said authorities "have all the data to continue with the project".
Mr Bhatnagar, the environmentalist, said that by going ahead with the project, the government was setting "a dangerous precedent" for similar development programmes to be carried out in other geologically sensitive areas.
"And for those affected, it once again underscores how development in India often comes at the cost of the most marginalised," he added.

Headline: Is the downfall of a Japanese star a turning point for women's rights?
Author: Shaimaa Khalil, Tokyo correspondent

Text: For months, Japan's entertainment industry has been rocked by a scandal that unseated one of its most popular celebrities and put one of its biggest broadcasters at risk.
But some believe it has also marked a turning point in how cases of sexual assault are perceived in Japan - where traditionally victims have been shamed into silence.
At its heart was Masahiro Nakai, a household name and leading presenter for Fuji TV, one of the country's biggest broadcasters.
Nakai, who is also a former member of J-pop boy band SMAP, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a dinner party in 2023.
The revelations, which appeared last December in the weekly tabloid magazine Josei Seven and were then picked up by the Shukan Bunshun, marked the latest of a series of scandals involving celebrities in Japan, including that of late entertainment mogul Johnny Kitagawa, who was found by investigators to have abused hundreds of boys and young men over six decades.
Nakai didn't admit guilt and denied using force against the woman. But he apologised for "causing trouble" in a statement and said that he had "resolved" the matter in a settlement, reportedly worth more than half a million dollars.
But as public anger mounted, he was forced to announce his retirement from the entertainment industry in January. Another channel, the Tokyo Broadcasting System, has also stopped airing a program that Nakai regularly appeared on as an MC.
The impact on Fuji TV has been devastating.
The broadcaster's reputation is now in ruins. Its revenue is under threat and some of its top executives have also been forced to step down.
High-profile companies like Nissan and Toyota were among those who pulled advertising from the broadcaster as outrage grew. Fuji TV has since admitted it allowed Nakai to continue presenting shows even after finding out about the allegations.
"If this had happened 10 years ago, there would not have been this outcry," Keiko Kojima, who worked in Japan's media industry for 15 years as a TV presenter, told the BBC.
Sexual violence against women is one of Japan's worst-kept secrets. A 2020 survey claimed that more than 70% of sexual assaults in the country go unreported. And according to a 2024 study published in the International Journal of Asian Studies, for every 1,000 rapes in Japan, only 10–20 result in a criminal conviction – and fewer than half of convicted rapists are incarcerated.
"There's still a prevalent attitude of 'Shoganai ' or 'there's nothing you can do' that is being projected on women - so they're encouraged to keep silent," Machiko Osawa, professor emeritus at Japan Women's University in Tokyo, told the BBC.
She added that women were seldom believed and did not have proper mechanisms to even report such incidents, which contributed to this culture of silence.
Ms Kojima said that the media industry, in particular, has long had a culture of impunity and lack of accountability where many young women felt they must keep silent to keep their jobs.
"It was common for men to make rude comments about women's bodies or appearance or age. I remember my colleagues and I being asked how many people we've had sex with," she said.
"We were expected to reply with a sense of humour without getting angry or offended. I saw sexual harassment and other forms of derogatory treatment of women on a daily basis. For a woman, adapting to these situations was the only way to become a full-fledged TV or media professional."
The Fuji TV case has also raised questions about dinners and drinking parties involving celebrities and young women - and how common they were.
Although Shukan Bunshun retracted an earlier report that claimed the alleged assault took place at a party organised by Fuji TV, Ms Kojima told the BBC that it was indeed common to use women as "tools for entertaining".
"In Japanese working culture, it's an everyday practice to half-forcibly take young female employees to events to entertain clients," she said.
"Men are happy when young women join them. The idea that women are like a gift and that taking a young woman with you is a way of offering hospitality to the other person is very common."
That is why the fallout from this scandal has encouraged women's rights activists.
Minori Kitahara, one of the founders of the Flower Demo movement - where groups of sexual violence survivors and their supporters gather in public spaces on the 11th of every month - admitted she was surprised at how swiftly and severely the sponsors reacted.
"Even if it's more of self-preservation than human rights for sponsors, this is a turning point for the MeToo movement in Japan," she told the BBC.
"It's up to us how big we make it."
Nearly 50 companies have walked away from the now-tarnished Fuji TV.
The Japanese government has also withdrawn all its recent and planned advertisements with the network. And it has called on the broadcaster to regain the trust of viewers and sponsors. So far Fuji TV seems to have done neither.
The scandal and Fuji TV's role in hiding it have sent the company on a crisis-management frenzy that seems to have led to deeper disgrace, fuelling even more public anger.
Fuji TV president Koichi Minato admitted that the company had known about the allegation shortly after the alleged incident.
But he said they chose not to disclose it at the time because they "prioritised the woman's physical and mental recovery as well as the protection of her privacy."
After a press conference held in the hope of defusing the outrage turned into a PR disaster, the company held a second one that lasted 10 hours.
It was intended to show remorse.
Both Fuji TV's chairman Shuji Kano and its President Koichi Minato stepped down, bowing humbly as they announced their resignations. The firm said its executive vice-president Kenji Shimizu would replace Mr Minato as president.
But this was seen as a mere face-saving exercise to appease advertisers rather than a sign of substantial change - especially because the president's replacement belonged to the same leadership cadre.
Professor Osawa told the BBC, however, that high-profile cases like Fuji TV become important precedents for real change.
And this is the latest saga in a series of prominent sexual misconduct cases that have generated conversation about women's rights in Japan.
These include the case of journalist Shiori Ito, who became a symbol of the country's MeToo movement in 2017. She took the rare step of going public with allegations that Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a well-known TV journalist, had raped her after she met him for drinks. While he denied the allegations, she won a civil lawsuit against him in 2019
"People have now started to realise that it was OK to speak out and say that this [sexual harassment] is a problem. We are changing what we take as the norm," Ms Kojima said.
But Ms Kojima and Ms Kitahara both say that Japan is not moving fast enough.
"I think it's time for that generation [of media leadership] to step down. The industry needs to create a new corporate culture. The change is slow," Ms Kojima said.
"The TV industry has long neglected the issue of exploitation and violence and has not dealt with the victims properly. If the root of the problem doesn't change, the same will happen again."
Professor Osawa agrees that Japan still has a long way to go because of the ubiquitous power imbalance in the country.
She adds that while women have been part of the workforce for decades they're still seen as the "caretakers" and men as the "breadwinners" by a society that is heavily shaped by patriarchal values.
"This is an important time... But it's unclear how far attitudes will change," she said.
While Ms Kitahara is hopeful, she says she's also angry: "The sexual violence never stops."
"I still meet new survivors at Flower Demo [protests] every month and learn what happened to them. We had a high school girl other day. When we started the movement [in 2019] she was probably in junior high, " she said.
"I hope for the day when I will never have to go to a Flower Demo protest again."

Headline: British couple in their 70s arrested by Taliban

Text: A British couple in their 70s have been arrested by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were returning to their home in Bamiyan on 1 February when they were detained.
The couple have been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years and their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks.
It is not known exactly what the couple were arrested for but projects run by them include one training mothers and children, which had apparently been approved by the local authorities despite a ban by the Taliban on women working and on education for girls older than the age of 12.
The couple, who originally met at the University of Bath, married in Kabul in 1970. Since 2009 they have been running training projects in five schools in Kabul and one project in Bamiyan training mothers and children.
While the Taliban's return to power in August 2021 saw most of their staff leave – along with most westerners – Mr and Mrs Reynolds insisted on staying put.
After their arrest, the couple were initially able to keep in touch with their four children by text message. The family knew that their parents were being held by the interior ministry and were assured by them that they were "fine".
Three days later, however, the texts stopped. The children have heard nothing since.
Ms Entwistle, who lives in Daventry, Northamptonshire, told the BBC: "It's been over two weeks since the messages stopped, and they were taken into custody.
"We would like the Taliban to release them to go back to their home and continue their work."
She told the Sunday Times: "They said they could not leave when Afghans were in their hour of need.
"They were meticulous about keeping by the rules even as they kept changing."
She added: "My mother is 75 and my father almost 80 and [he] needs his heart medication after a mini-stroke. They were just trying to help the country they loved. The idea they are being held because they were teaching mothers with children is outrageous."
The couple were arrested alongside their American friend Faye Hall and a translator from their business, the PA news agency reported, quoting an employee.
The employee, who described the pair as "the most honourable people I have ever met", said Mr Reynolds had been denied access to heart medication and his condition was "not good".
Ms Entwistle and her three siblings have written a letter to the Taliban, pleading with them to release their parents.
"We do not understand the reasons behind their arrest," they wrote. "They have communicated their trust in you, and that as Afghan citizens they will be treated well."
"We recognise that there have been instances where exchanges have been beneficial for your government and western nations. However, our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded."
The Foreign Office is aware two British nationals have been detained in Afghanistan. But assistance is limited by the fact that the UK does not recognise the Taliban and has no embassy in Kabul.
Taliban official sources have told the BBC they arrested British nationals, who they believe were working for a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Bamiyan province.
An official claimed they had been arrested, about 20 days ago, after using a plane without informing Bamiyan police headquarters or the border security forces.
The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for NGOs in 2022 and in December last year Al Jazeera reported the government had said it would close any NGOs employing women.

Headline: India v Pakistan: Cricket's ultimate grudge match in the desert
Author: Gautam Bhattacharyya, Cricket writer, Dubai
Published Date: 2025-02-22T01:04:20.943Z
Text: The last time India and Pakistan clashed in a major ICC 50-over contest was in 2023, at the highly anticipated World Cup league match in Ahmedabad.
As a contest, it turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax - India, in dominant form, comfortably chased down a subpar Pakistan target, securing a resounding victory.
And as Pakistani fans didn't get visas to travel to India, aside from the cricket team, the country's only notable presence was in the media centre.
Sunday's ICC Champions Trophy clash between the arch-rivals at Dubai International Stadium promises a vastly different atmosphere.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) reported that tickets sold out within minutes - and with the UAE hosting more than 3.7 million Indians and nearly 1.7 million Pakistanis, a vibrant and well-represented crowd from both nations is all but guaranteed.
But can a sea of green flags in the stands inspire Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan's men to defy the odds in this must-win clash against Rohit Sharma's India?
Pakistan can take comfort in their strong head-to-head record in UAE - 19 wins in 28 ODIs, plus a lone T20I victory in the 2021 World Cup in Dubai.
Most of Pakistan's wins against India came at Sharjah during their dominant run in the 1980s and '90s, winning 18 of 24 games there.
In Dubai, India beat them twice in the 2018 Asia Cup, while both teams won a game each in a 2006 Abu Dhabi series.
Since Pakistan's glory days in Sharjah, the tide has shifted - apart from the occasional T20I win, India has largely dominated in the new millennium.
Veteran cricket writer Ayaz Memon feels there is no reason to look at India-Pakistan clashes in the UAE through the prism of the past.
''There is no doubt that Pakistan enjoyed tremendous crowd support in the Sharjah days, with the local Pathan population making up the numbers. However, the team then boasted of the likes of Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar, Aamer Sohail and the two Ws [Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis]," Memon says.
"Compare that to the state of the current team, which comes up with some exceptional results from time to time but lacks any form of consistency."
The glitzy, ever-expanding United Arab Emirates city-state of Dubai offers little sign of a major cricket event - there are no welcome banners at the airport.
Instead, hoardings of Jannik Sinner, Iga Swiatek and company dominate, as the city is in full swing for the annual Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.
Head south, and the 'Ring of Fire' at Dubai International Stadium emerges from the highway, signalling cricket's presence.
Towering images of all eight captains line the arena, but for the next two days, all eyes will be on Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Rizwan's teams as fans worldwide await their fate.
It's no secret that catering to broadcasters and marketing demands, the ICC consistently places India and Pakistan in the same group for major tournaments. This ensures at least one high-stakes league clash, with the potential for a blockbuster rematch in the knockouts.
At a time when cricket faces overexposure and its international structure is threatened by the rise of T20 franchise leagues, the India-Pakistan rivalry remains its biggest box-office draw.
A big plus about the tight, top-eight team format of the ICC Champions Trophy is that a little slip-up can cost even the heavyweights dear.
''The 50-over World Cup gives you a chance to pull back even if you stumble in the odd game as there are 10 games in the fray. It's much different here where all three of your group matches are important to proceed to the semi-finals,'' India captain Sharma said on the eve of their opening match against Bangladesh.
India cleared their first hurdle with a six-wicket win against Bangladesh on Thursday, powered by Shubman Gill's classy century (cementing his status as a future ODI captain), Mohammed Shami's five-wicket haul and a quickfire cameo from skipper Sharma, who crossed the 11,000-run mark in the format.
Jasprit Bumrah's absence - expected as he recovers from a back spasm sustained in the final Test in Australia - remains a talking point. However, on this wicket, the spotlight is set to shift to the spinners.
Pakistan's lead-up to the tournament has been a rollercoaster - both unpredictable and vulnerable. Their last three ODIs paint the picture perfectly.
Ten days ago, Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha's stunning 260-run stand powered Pakistan to a record 353-run chase against South Africa in Karachi, securing a spot in the Tri-series final.
But just two days later, they faltered, looking ordinary as New Zealand cruised to a five-wicket win, denying them a confidence boosting title ahead of the Champions Trophy.
Then on Wednesday, after their bowlers made early inroads, they let the Kiwis off the hook, eventually crashing to a 60-run defeat in their tournament opener.
This has put their backs against the wall ahead of the big game - and what has irked former Pakistan greats is captain Rizwan's statement that they will take the India match as "just another game".
History shows that Pakistan thrives in such situations, echoing Imran Khan's legendary "caged tigers" rallying cry from their triumphant 1992 World Cup campaign.
Yes, the odds favour India, but Pakistan can never be written off on UAE soil. After all, it's a new day, a fresh battle, and anything can happen in a big game.

Headline: Trump's '$21m for voter turnout' claim triggers political row in India

Text: US President Donald Trump's remark that his country spent $21m to boost voter turnout in India's elections has triggered a political slugfest in the country.
He made the remark days after a team led by Elon Musk said it had cancelled the payout as part of its crackdown on a US agency providing foreign aid.
India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called the payout an "external interference" and accused the opposition Congress party of seeking this intervention.
The Congress denied the allegation, calling Trump's claims "nonsensical". The US has not provided any evidence to support its claim.
On Friday, India's foreign ministry said it found the claims "deeply troubling".
Foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it was "premature" to make public statements about the matter at this stage and that relevant authorities were investigating it.
Trump vowed to boost the US economy and soon after returning to office, he created the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led by Musk, to slash federal spending and jobs. Musk says Doge's mission is to save taxpayer money and cut national debt.
One of its biggest moves - now making global headlines - is a crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid since the 1960s. Musk, who has called USAID a "criminal organisation", announced on Sunday that funding for several projects had been cancelled.
The cuts included $486m for the "Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening", with "$21m for voter turnout in India" and "$22m for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova".
Defending Doge's cuts, Trump said India "had a lot of money" and was among the world's highest-taxing nations.
On Thursday, he doubled down, questioning the $21m spend on "India's voter turnout".
The latest comments came a week after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first Washington visit under Trump's second term, where Trump announced expanded military sales, increased energy exports and plans for a trade deal and new defence framework.
"I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government," the US president said at a summit in Miami.
The same day, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a clip of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi speaking at an event in London before the 2024 general election.
In the clip, Gandhi can be heard saying that major democracies like the US and European countries were "oblivious that a huge chunk of democratic model has come undone [in India]".
"Rahul Gandhi was in London, urging foreign powers - from the US to Europe - to intervene in India's internal affairs," Malviya alleged in his post on X.
Congress leader Jairam Ramesh dismissed the claim and urged the government to report on USAID's decades-long support to governmental and non-governmental institutions during PM Modi's tenure.
Despite widespread reports, neither Doge nor Trump has provided evidence that USAID gave India $21m for voter turnout.
India's poll panel has not responded, but former election chief SY Qureshi denied receiving such funding during his tenure, which ran from 2010 to 2012.
Earlier, Malviya claimed that in 2012, under Mr Qureshi, the panel signed an agreement with a group linked to George Soros' foundation - primarily funded by USAID - to support a voter turnout campaign.
Mr Qureshi dismissed the allegation as "malicious", stating that the agreement explicitly imposed "no financial or legal obligation on either side".
On Friday, the Indian Express newspaper said in an investigative report that the $21m was sanctioned for Bangladesh and not India.
It was meant to run for three years until July 2025 and that $13.4m had already been spent, according to records accessed by the newspaper.

Headline: Man disguised as lawyer kills gang leader in court

Text: A notorious gang leader has died after he was shot inside a courthouse in Sri Lanka by a gunman disguised as a lawyer, say police.
Police say the gunman used a revolver which was smuggled in a hollowed-out book by a female suspect, who remains at large.
Gang leader Sanjeewa Kumara Samararathne had been escorted to court to face proceedings when he was shot. Police say he was a suspect in multiple murder cases.
The shooting in the capital Colombo is among a series of killings by rivalling gangs, which has persisted as authorities vow to crack down on gang violence in the country.
The gang leader, popularly known as Ganemulle Sanjeewa, had been in custody since he was arrested in September 2023.
Police said he had been escorted to the courthouse on Wednesday by a dozen police officers. He was taken to hospital after he was shot but was pronounced dead on arrival.
The gunman managed to flee the scene but was later captured by police. He has been identified differently by authorities and local media, but police say that he used several names.
Police have identified the female suspect as 25-year-old Pinpura Dewage Ishara Sewwandi.
Authorities have put out a notice promising a reward for anyone providing information on the woman. Police say they have also arrested a policeman and van driver suspected of helping the two suspects in the shooting.
Lawmakers discussed reining in gang violence in parliament on Wednesday, with an opposition MP calling it a "major security issue".
Health and mass media minister Nalinda Jayatissa, who in December had pledged to crack down on such criminal activity, said on Wednesday that the government would "take the actions of organised underworld gangs seriously."
The incident has also raised questions about security in the courthouse, with authorities currently reviewing security measures.
New security protocols are being implemented in the wake of the shooting, including deploying armed guards when certain people are brought to court. Armed security personnel are not typically allowed in court, justice minister Harshana Nanayakkara said on Thursday.
At least nine people have died this year in a spate of shootings blamed on gang rivalry, according to AFP citing police data.

Headline: Hong Kong's main opposition party announces plan to dissolve
Author: Martin Yip, BBC Chinese, Reporting fromHong Kong, Tessa Wong, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore
Published Date: 2025-02-21T04:32:14.071Z
Text: The leaders of Hong Kong's Democratic Party have announced plans to dissolve what was once the city's largest opposition group.
Members will soon vote on the final decision on whether to shut down the 31-year-old party, chairman Lo Kin-hei said.
The party has been struggling to survive following moves by China to crack down on dissent in the city in the wake of the 2019 protests.
Beijing and Hong Kong's government have argued that such moves were necessary for national security.
As part of the crackdown, Beijing overhauled the former British colony's polling systems.
The so-called "patriots law" was passed in Hong Kong in 2021 that ensured only people regarded as loyal to the Communist regime in Beijing could serve as lawmakers or local councillors in the semi-autonomous territory.
This law effectively barred the Democratic Party from taking part in elections.
At a late-night press conference on Tuesday after a party meeting, Mr Lo said the party's leaders had made the call to wind down based on the "current political situation".
"Developing democracy in Hong Kong is always difficult, and it's especially difficult in the past few years," Mr Lo said to reporters.
He did not comment when asked if the party's leaders' decision had been made under political pressure.
The party has set up a work group for the shutdown process. At least 75% of its members attending an upcoming general meeting will have to approve the move before it is final. A date for that meeting is yet to be set.
On Wednesday, Hong Kong government adviser Regina Ip accused the Democratic Party of pursuing an agenda that opposed China and "constantly causing trouble inside and outside parliament".
"Therefore I am not surprised at all that they have been losing supporters in recent years... the Democratic Party has already reached a dead end," said Ms Ip, co-convener of Hong Kong's cabinet-like Executive Council.
The Democratic Party was notable for having rare direct negotiations with the Liaison Office - the Chinese Communist government's representation in Hong Kong - in 2010, to discuss plans for more liberal elections.
Its younger members, however, saw those negotiations as a betrayal. The move triggered a split while the party lost support.
It subsequently regained strength and became the most successful opposition political force in the city after acquiring the most seats in the 2019 local council elections, which took place during the violent anti-government protests.
A number of the Democratic Party's members - including prominent pro-democracy figures Helena Wong, Lam Cheuk-ting, Wu Chi-wai and Albert Ho - are among the Hong Kong 47 group of campaigners jailed under the controversial national security law.
Another member, former legislator Ted Hui, is now living in Australia in exile and is wanted by the Hong Kong government for alleged national security offences. Earlier this week a court issued an order to confiscate his assets and money in Hong Kong, which are held by his family and a law firm.
In December, Hong Kong stripped the honorary Justice of the Peace title from Martin Lee KC, a key founder of the Democratic Party, after the veteran barrister lost his appeal against an unauthorised assembly conviction.

Text: A passenger train derailed after striking a herd of elephants near a wildlife reserve in central Sri Lanka in the early hours of Thursday.
While no injuries were reported among passengers, six elephants died from the accident in Habarana, east of the capital Colombo.
Two injured elephants were being treated, police said, noting that it was the worst such wildlife accident the country had seen, AFP reported.
It is not uncommon for trains to run into herds of elephants in Sri Lanka, where casualties on both sides of human-elephant encounters are among the highest in the world.
Last year, more than 170 people and nearly 500 elephants were killed in human-elephant encounters overall - and around 20 elephants are killed by trains annually, according to local media.
Elephants, whose natural habitats are affected by deforestation and shrinking resources, have increasingly strayed into places of human activity.
Some have urged train drivers to slow down and sound the train horns to warn animals ahead on railway tracks.
In 2018, a pregnant elephant and its two calves similarly died in Habarana after being struck by a train. The three had been part of a larger herd crossing the train tracks at dawn.
Last October, another train ran into a herd in Minneriya, about 25km (15 miles) away from Habarana, killing two elephants and injuring one.
There are an estimated 7,000 wild elephants in Sri Lanka, where the animals, revered by its Buddhist majority, are protected by law. Killing an elephant is a crime punishable by imprisonment or a fine.

Headline: Search for missing India miners ends as bodies recovered after 44 days

Text: Rescuers have ended a 44-day search operation after they found the bodies of five men who were trapped inside a flooded coal mine in India's north-eastern state of Assam.
DNA tests will be conducted to identify the men as the bodies are in a decomposed state, a state official told the BBC.
On 6 January, nine miners were trapped after water flooded the so-called "rat-hole" mine, which is a narrow hole dug manually to extract coal.
Four bodies were recovered within the first week, and search operations had continued until Wednesday, when the remaining bodies were found.
"The process to identify the remains has been initiated," Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on the social media platform X.
The families of the miners have also been called to identify the bodies. They will be given compensation by the state government, said Riki Phukan, an official from Assam's District Disaster Management Authority.
The search operations - at the Umrangso coal mine in Assam's Dima Hasao district - were jointly conducted by special disaster forces alongside the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the state police and the district disaster authority.
Divers and helicopters were also deployed but the remote, hilly terrain of the mine had posed severe challenges.
Earlier, one of the men rescued from the mine had shared with the BBC a harrowing account of the moments after the tunnel was suddenly engulfed by water.
Ravi Rai, a worker from Nepal, said that he was working inside the mine when water entered the pit.
"We were holding on to a rope in 50-60ft (15-18m) deep water for at least 50 minutes before being pulled out," he said.
Despite a ban on "rat-hole" mining in India since 2014, small illegal mines continue to be operational in Assam and other north-eastern states.
Six workers were killed in January 2024 after a fire broke out in a rat-hole coal mine in Nagaland state.
In 2018, at least 15 men were trapped in an illegal mine in Meghalaya after water from a nearby river flooded it.
After the recent accident, police in Assam have said they are investigating illegal mining activities in the state.

Headline: 'Captain America must die in China': Nationalism fuels Ne Zha 2 fans

Text: A chorus of praise is being sung around Ne Zha 2, the Chinese film about a mythical boy who battles demons, which has been newly crowned the world's highest-grossing animated film.
The box office triumph of the film - which has raked in 12.3bn yuan ($1.7bn; £1.4bn) - triggered a huge swell of national pride across the country.
But as patriotic Ne Zha 2 fans set their sights on further success, they are also keeping a close eye on critics of the movie, accusing them of being clout-chasing, paid "haters".
Also in the crosshairs of this nationalism is Captain America: Brave New World, the fourth movie of the superhero franchise, now seen as Ne Zha 2's rival.
"I don't care if Ne Zha 2 can survive overseas, but Captain America 4 must die in China," reads a popular slogan that has been repeated on multiple posts on social media.
In Chinese news outlets and social media, people are gloating over the lacklustre performance of the American blockbuster at China's box office. Of the $92m the film has made outside the US, only $10.6m has come from China, Hollywood's largest overseas market.
"It's not Captain America that's dying, but America that's dying," reads the title of an essay on an online forum analysing the movie's lack of appeal in China.
The author goes on to argue: "In reality, the US does not have superheroes and the US is not a peace-loving, peace-defending beacon for humanity."
One cinema in Sichuan province reportedly decided to hold off screenings of Captain America 4 in its theatres "in order to support Ne Zha 2".
Meanwhile, some are critical that Ne Zha 2, which premiered outside China this month, did not get enough screenings in North American cinemas. They have also accused American cinemas of showing other movies rather than the Chinese film.
Ne Zha 2 hit the screens in China on 29 January, among a string of high-profile movies designed to capture an annual surge of cinemagoers during the Lunar New Year holiday.
It quickly towered over the competition, crossing the $1bn milestone in less than two weeks - even more impressive considering China's sluggish economy.
Ne Zha 2 is being hailed as a symbol of progress in Chinese film and a sign that domestic productions can rival Hollywood blockbusters at the box office.
Previous domestic box office hits have tended to be patriotic, action films such as The Battle of Lake Changjin, a 2021 propaganda film about the 1950s Korean War, which held the record for China's highest-grossing film until Ne Zha 2 broke it.
While Hollywood films usually see their revenues spread across different regions, more than 99% of Ne Zha 2's box office earnings are coming from China - where the animation has become a litmus test for patriotism.
On social media, people say they have bought tickets to watch Ne Zha 2 multiple times. And those who have not watched the movie say they have to deal with snide remarks.
"A friend told me I was not patriotic, just because I did not watch Ne Zha 2," a social media user posted on Douyin, China's TikTok.
As cinemagoers took to social media to share their reviews of the movie, criticisms - from the lack of plot continuity to its awkward humour and anti-feminist undertones - were met with a barrage of dismissive comments.
"People like that are either clout-chasing, or are being paid," read one comment on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app.
Insults of this nature are not new, a Chinese social media user who has posted criticisms of Ne Zha 2 and experienced such backlash first-hand, tells the BBC. But the defensiveness surrounding the film is more pronounced because of its meteoric success, which has turned it into a proxy for the Chinese film industry.
In the eyes of these fans, who only see things in black and white, to criticise the movie is to side with Hollywood, they say.
"Everyone beware, there's currently a wave of haters swarming Ne Zha 2 with criticism online," another Xiaohongshu user commented, adding that the "premeditated" criticisms came from jealous individuals in either foreign or domestic film industries.
"With such a great movie, people are using their feet to vote. So they are turning to panic and slander. How despicable!" they wrote.
Ne Zha 2's huge success is helping introduce characters from Chinese mythology to new audiences around the world, and it's been praised for its script, special effects and the quality of animation. But the fact it has become a focal point for nationalist sentiment has led to some in China raising concerns about the growing political significance the film has taken on.
"Ne Zha 2 has become a cultural phenomenon, but I don't think this is entirely a good thing," reads a Xiaohongshu post reflecting on the sharpening debate over the movie.
"Criticising the plot flaws is equated to being unpatriotic; unreservedly condemning other films released in the same period; replacing deep discussion with a war between fans and haters ... This is definitely not a good cultural environment."

Headline: British tourist dies trekking with friend in Himalayas

Text: A British tourist has died while trekking with a friend in the Himalayan mountains in northern India.
The two British men were hiking in "extremely difficult terrain" near the village of Thathri in Dharamshala when one of them was critically injured, local emergency services said.
The man was rescued and taken down the mountain on a stretcher, but by the time he reached hospital nearly 24 hours later he was declared dead, rescuers said.
The Foreign Office said they were "supporting the family of a British man who has died in India and are in contact with the local authorities".
According to the Times of India, the pair were hiking the Triund trek, a popular route of about 7km (4.3 miles) in the foothills of the Dhauladhar mountain range.
They were on their descent when one of the men fell and his friend sought help from the nearby village, the newspaper reports.
Local rescuers, the Himachal Pradesh State Disaster Response Force, said on X that the call for their help had come in at 18:00 on Sunday, and a team of 10 people had been sent up the mountain to search for the men.
"After four hours of trekking, the team located the victims at 10:30pm with one trekker in a critical condition. They secured the critical trekker onto a stretcher and began the challenging descent along with his co trekker.
"The rough terrain and repeated crossings of a rivulet made progress extremely slow, requiring nearly two hours to cover just 100m."
Overnight the team requested backup, and more rescuers arrived in the morning.
"They continued transporting the victims but faced extreme difficulty due to the steep landscape, requiring multiple anchorings of the stretcher."
The man was finally taken to hospital at 17:08 on Monday but was declared dead on arrival, rescuers added. His friend was unharmed.
The local authorities in Kangra district had brought in a temporary ban on trekking in high-altitude areas, but the Times of India says the two tourists were unaware of it.
It said they had reached the snowline - the part of the mountain where snow is on the ground all year round.
The victim has yet to be formally identified.

Headline: 'We will unite with Kim Jong Un': Conspiracies grip South Korea
Author: Jean Mackenzie, Seoul Correspondent

Text: On a cold January afternoon, a young pharmacy student, Shin Jeong-min, waited restlessly outside South Korea's Constitutional Court, as the country's suspended president arrived to fight his impeachment.
While Yoon Suk Yeol testified, she chanted along with hundreds of his incensed and worried supporters, who have rallied around him ever since his failed attempt to impose martial law. "Release him now. Cancel his impeachment," they shouted.
"If the president is impeached and the opposition leader is elected, our country will become one with North Korea and Kim Jong Un," Jeong-min said, citing a theory popular among President Yoon's most fanatical followers: that the left-leaning opposition party wants to unify with the North and turn South Korea into a communist country.
At 22 years old, Jeong-min stands out from the legion of elderly Koreans who have always feared and despised the North, and make up the bulk of those who hold these far-right conspiratorial beliefs.
That generation of Koreans, now in its 60s and 70s, lived through the Cold War and remembers bitterly the devastating aftermath of North Korea's invasion in the 1950s.
When Yoon declared martial law in early December, he played on these fears to justify his power grab.
Without citing evidence, he claimed that "North Korean communist forces" had infiltrated the opposition party and were trying to overthrow the country. They needed to be "eradicated", he said, as he moved swiftly to ban political activity and put the army in charge.
Two months on from his failed coup, an anti-communist frenzy is gripping Yoon's supporters, young and old.
Even some who had never given North Korea or communism much thought are now convinced their dynamic democracy is on the brink of being turned into a leftist dictatorship – and that their leader had no choice but to remove people's democratic rights in order to protect them from both Pyongyang and Beijing.
"This a war between communism and democracy," said one office worker in his 40s, who had slipped out of work to join the protest at the court.
Another man, in his 30s, adamantly argued the president had to be returned to office as soon as possible. "He's going to arrest all the North Korean spies," he said.
Such threats were once very real. During the 1960s and 70s, spies would regularly attempt to infiltrate the government.
In 1968, a group of North Korean commandos crawled across the border and tried to assassinate then President Park Chung-hee. A tree atop Seoul's Bugak mountain still bears the bullet marks from the intense gun battles that raged for nearly two weeks.
In the 1980s, during the final years of South Korea's violent military dictatorship, a radical far-left student movement began to praise Pyongyang for its "superior" political system. They were labelled regime "sympathisers".
It was also common for authoritarian leaders to accuse their political adversaries of being North Korean conspirators.
"Anti-communism became the dominant ideology of South Korea's military dictators, who used it to control society and justify restricting people's freedom," said Shin Jin-wook, a sociology professor at Chungang University.
Today, these threats have dissipated. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and advanced cyber-hacking abilities pose the greater risk, and you would struggle to find anyone in South Korea who wants to emulate life in the North. The political left and right are merely divided over how to deal with their troublesome neighbour.
While the approach of Yoon's conservative People Power Party has been to try to threaten the North into submission with military superiority, the left-leaning Democratic Party prefers to engage with Pyongyang, believing the two countries can peacefully co-exist.
The president has been accused of exploiting people's historic fears. "Yoon's rhetoric almost completely matches that of past dictators, and he is the first president to use this anti-communist ideology so blatantly since Korea became a democracy in 1987," said Mr Shin.
Not only has Yoon accused the parliament, led by the opposition Democratic Party, of being riddled with Pyongyang sympathisers, but he has dangled the idea that North Korea, with help from China, rigged last year's parliamentary election.
"This is fake news cooked up by Yoon to demonise the opposition and justify his completely undemocratic move," one Democratic Party lawmaker, Wi Sung-lac, told the BBC.
"We have a long history of fighting for democracy and freedom in Korea. We are the ones who managed to thwart Yoon's attempt to destroy Korea's democracy," he said, referring to the opposition politicians who pushed past troops and climbed over the parliament's walls during martial law to vote down the motion.
Such ideas were previously pedalled by extreme conservative groups, said Lee Sangsin, a polling expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification.
"These groups were isolated. People didn't take much notice," he explained. "But because Yoon is the president, his words carry weight, and many people have accepted what he said."
This was evident at one of the pro-Yoon weekend rallies we attended last month. Far from being die-hard conspiracy theorists, nearly everyone we spoke to said Yoon had changed their thinking.
"At first I didn't support Yoon, but martial law opened my eyes," said Oh Jung-hyuk, a 57-year-old musician, there with his wife. "We can see how deeply embedded leftist forces are in our society." One woman in her 40s told us she previously had doubts about Chinese vote rigging but had researched the issue after martial law and "realised it was true".
Yoon's supporters often point to real events – how the previous Democratic Party President, Moon Jae-in, met Kim Jong Un to try to orchestrate a peace deal; that the current Democratic leader, Lee Jae-myung, is being investigated for helping to send millions of dollars to North Korea - then use these as evidence of a greater plot.
"This far-fetched conspiracy theory that China rigged the election is becoming more and more accepted," said the sociology professor Mr Shin. "One of the most basic consensuses in a democracy is the premise of fair and free elections, and now we have people distrusting that. This is very extreme."
As Yoon's unsubstantiated claims have taken root, his support seems to have grown. Although the majority of people in South Korea still want him permanently removed from office, the number has fallen. Last week it stood at 57%, compared to 75% in the week after the martial law declaration.
Through his anti-communist rhetoric, Yoon has also effectively tapped into a simmering distrust of China. To fear North Korea now means to be wary of China too.
At a recent weekend rally in Seoul, many supporters had swapped their trademark "Stop the Steal" election fraud placards for ones that read "Chinese Communist Party OUT".
"I believe China is interfering in all South Korea's political affairs. It's pulling the strings behind the scenes," said 66-year-old Jo Yeon-deok, who was holding one of the signs.
According to the polling expert, Mr Lee, "a growing portion of the public now believes China wants to turn South Korea into some kind of vassal state".
For those in their 20s and 30s who have never experienced real danger from North Korea, China is a more believable threat. Last year the Pew Research Centre found that South Korea and Hungary were the only two countries where the young had a more negative view of China than the old.
But contrary to the information they are being fed, young people's fears have nothing to do with communism, said Cho Jin-man, a political scientist at Duksung Women's University.
Until recently South Koreans felt their country was superior to China, Mr Cho explained - but as Beijing has become stronger and more assertive they have started to see it as a threat, especially since the US started treating it as such.
On top of that, young people have a lot of grievances: they're struggling to find work or afford a home, and feel resentful when they see their universities catering to Chinese students.
Communism, Mr Cho believes, is being used as a convenient catch-all bogeyman to stir up fear and hate. This message is amplified by far-right YouTube channels, particularly popular with young men.
"North Korea and China are my biggest concerns," said Kim Gyung-joo, a 30-year-old IT developer, who came alone to one of the rallies. He used to be left-wing like his friends, he said, and was initially very critical of the president's martial law order. But after researching the issue on YouTube he realised martial law was "unavoidable".
"If I'd been in the president's position, I'd have declared it too," he said.
Nonetheless, Wi Sung-lac the opposition politician is not concerned about his party losing support. "Even though these extreme views are spreading, they will be limited," he said. "Most people understand who we really are, and they are yearning for a return to normality."
Polling expert Lee Sang-sin is less sanguine, likening Yoon's supporters to "a fast-growing cult". The president's move was "very divisive", he said.
"It is going to have a lasting effect on Korean society".

Headline: YouTuber's 'dirty' comments spark massive row in India
Author: Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai
Published Date: 2025-02-19T22:50:11.468Z
Text: "Dirty." "Perverted mind." "Disgusting."
These were the words India's Supreme Court used on Tuesday while granting interim protection from arrest to a popular YouTuber who has been in the eye of a storm in the country over the past week.
The furore began after Ranveer Allahbadia - whose YouTube channel BeerBiceps has eight million followers - asked a contestant the question: "Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?"
The comments, made on the show India's Got Latent on 9 February, sparked massive outrage, police cases and even death threats. YouTube quickly removed the episode, but that didn't stall the tide of anger directed at Allahbadia and the show.
In fact, the amount of attention the incident has received is mind-boggling: it has made national headlines, been covered on primetime TV and some of India's most prominent news sites have even run live pages.
Not surprising, considering the star status of Allahbadia. He has interviewed federal ministers, top Bollywood celebrities, cricketers and Hollywood actors. And last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed him a "National Creators Awards" trophy.
Since the controversy erupted, Allahbadia and the show's creator, Samay Raina, have apologised for the comments and Raina has taken down all previous episodes of the show. The Supreme Court in its recent order has even banned Allahbadia from posting content on social media.
But the incident continues to make news.
"It feels like the state is trying to make an example out of Allahbadia," says Apar Gupta, founder of the Internet Freedom Foundation. Saket Gokhale, an opposition lawmaker, also condemned the targeting of Allahbadia and the show.
"Crass content can be criticised if it offends you. However, you cannot have the state persecute and lock up people for offending your 'moral sentiments'," he wrote in a post on X.
Popular comedian Vir Das also weighed in on the controversy and criticised news channels for their one-dimensional coverage of the incident and for taking a disparaging view of all digital content.
Allahbadia's remarks and the subsequent backlash have triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity laws; it has also sparked conversations around the thirst for viral content and the consequences its makers face when their content crosses lines upheld by the very people who watch it.
Raina's show, which debuted in June, has been popular from the start, with each episode being viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube. And it hasn't shied away from kickstarting controversies either.
The show has platformed some bizarre performances and judges and contestants have been seen making crass and crude comments more than a few times. Critics have accused the show of spewing misogynistic views and for body-shaming guests.
A popular fashion influencer once walked out of the show after a male contestant compared her to a former adult film actress while another asked her about her "body count" (a slang term for the number of sexual partners a person has had).
But that seems to have been the appeal of the show too.
Fans of the show have hailed it for championing "raw talent and unfiltered jokes". Some have said that they liked the roasts - a form of insult comedy - which was popular on the show.
Experts have underscored how, with the entertainment landscape exploding, digital content creators often feel compelled to push the envelope - even if it means resorting to the risqué and lewd - just to gain views and virality.
It's safe to say the show pushed the envelope and the buttons of many. But then, it backfired.
"A lot of comedy, especially of a certain masculine kind, is cruel and punches down on people. It has a violent undercurrent. So if you contribute to that culture, it's not a shock if it comes back to bite you some day," filmmaker Paromita Vohra says.
She adds that successful comedy calls for a fine-tuned awareness of the audience it is being performed for and what boundaries it can push.
Interestingly, Allahbadia's question, which sparked the furore, was almost identical to the question asked by the host of an Australian comedy show called OG Crew's Truth or Drink. While the question didn't spark outrage in Australia, it has in India.
"The internet has made it possible for content to reach spaces and people it was not organically playing to. Unthinkingly appropriating content can have unexpected consequences," she says.
But she also says that there's a need to guard against making such issues a question of morality.
"When such controversies erupt, there is always the risk of morality being weaponised to punish people who have gone against what's accepted by society," she says and adds that morality is increasingly being beaten into the legal framework of the country, which can have a divisive effect.
Some critics have also accused the authorities of using the controversy as a smoke screen to divert attention from other pressing problems - like unemployment and pollution. Some fear that it will be used by the federal government as a reason to justify further regulating content creation.
After the controversy, a report by NDTV news channel stated that a parliamentary panel was considering making laws around digital content stricter. The Supreme Court too has pushed for more regulations around online content.
Mr Gupta says the state already has a "tremendous amount of power" to prosecute people accused of flouting various data and content laws and that while the state exercises its powers without restraint, content creators don't have as many legal safeguards to protect them.
"Instead of tighter laws, we need more reform; existing legal standards need to be more tolerant of free expression," he says.
"Other systems, like education and digital learning should be strengthened so that young people know to get their education from the classroom, and turn to the internet only for entertainment."

Headline: No faecal bacteria in Kumbh Mela river waters, says minister
Author: Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai

Text: The chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state has rejected a government report that found high levels of contamination in a key bathing place at the Kumbh Mela, the world's largest gathering.
The report said the waters at Sangam - the confluence of rivers considered holy by Hindus - in Prayagraj city had alarming levels of untreated sewage and bacteria found in human and animal excreta, making it unfit for bathing.
On Wednesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath insisted that the water was not just fit for bathing, but also safe for doing aachman - the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing.
Authorities say 565 million have bathed since the festival began on 13 January.
The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years.
Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation.
The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February.
However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival.
Before the Mela began, India's top environment court had directed the pollution control boards of the federal and state governments to monitor the water in the rivers regularly and to take adequate steps to maintain its quality.
But a report submitted by the federal government's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month stated that the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna had high coliform levels.
Coliform level is a key indicator of the presence of untreated sewage and faecal bacteria in water.
The report said that the coliform levels in the Ganges were 1,400 times more than the acceptable limit, and in the Yamuna river, they were 660 times more.
The CPCB analysed water samples from both the rivers on five separate days in January, but the coliform levels never met standards, the report added.
Chief Minister Adityanath, however, insisted that his government was continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality.
"All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification," he said.
"The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is as per the standards," he added.
He accused the opposition of running a "false campaign" to defame the Kumbh Mela.
This is not the first time that the Uttar Pradesh government has come under scrutiny for the way it has organised and is managing the Kumbh Mela.
On one of the most auspicious bathing days in January, at least 30 people died in a crush that took place near the Sangam.
On Sunday, another crush at the New Delhi Railway Station - where thousands of devotees had gathered to board trains for Prayagraj - killed around 18 people.

Headline: 'Real life Squid Game': Kim Sae-ron's death exposes Korea's celebrity culture
Author: Kelly Ng, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-19T10:18:14.003Z
Text: Actress Kim Sae-ron's death in an apparent suicide has renewed criticism of South Korea's entertainment industry, which churns out stars but also subjects them to immense pressure and scrutiny.
Kim - who was found dead aged 24 at her home in Seoul on Sunday - had been bombarded with negative press coverage and hate online after a drink-driving conviction in 2022. Police have not provided further details about her death.
Experts found the circumstances leading to it depressingly familiar. Other celebrities also ended up taking their lives after careers upended by cyberbullying.
As Kim was laid to rest on Wednesday, analysts say they are not optimistic her death will lead to meaningful change.
South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world – that's four times the population of South Korea.
But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry.
South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising.
This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive "super fans" who can make or break careers.
That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds.
"It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism," Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.
He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law.
Sulli had offended fans for not conforming to the K-pop mould, while an internet mob had targeted Goo Hara over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend.
Cyberbullying has also become a money-making gig for some, Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.
"YouTubers get the views, forums get the engagement, news outlets get the traffic. I don't think [Kim's death] will change the situation.
"There needs to be harsher criminal punishment against leaving nasty comments," he says.
Kim Sae-ron's father has blamed a YouTuber for her death, claiming the controversial videos they published caused her deep emotional distress.
Others have pointed fingers at some local media outlets, who reportedly fuelled public animosity against Kim by reporting the unverified claims.
"This cycle of media-driven character assassination must stop," civic group Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media said in a statement on Tuesday.
Na Jong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Yale University, likened the spate of celebrity deaths in South Korea to a real-life version of Squid Game, the South Korean Netflix blockbuster which sees the indebted fighting to the death for a huge cash prize.
"Our society abandons those who stumble and moves on as if nothing happened.. How many more lives must be lost before we stop inflicting this destructive, suffocating shame on people?" he wrote on Facebook.
"Drunk driving is a big mistake. There would be a problem with our legal system if that goes unpunished. However, a society that buries people who make mistakes without giving them a second chance is not a healthy one," Prof Na added.
Last year, the BBC reported on how "super fans" in the notorious K-pop industry try to dictate their idols' private lives - from their romantic relationships to their daily activities outside of work - and can be unforgiving when things go off script.
It is no surprise that Kim Sae-ron chose to withdraw from the public eye after her DUI conviction, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023.
It is worth noting however, that not all public figures are subject to the same treatment. Politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, also have past drink-driving convictions but have been able to bounce back - polls show Lee is now the country's top presidential contender.
In South Korea, it is "extremely tough" for artistes to recover when they do something that puts a crack in their "idol" image, says K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin.
He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even "add a rockstar-like edge" to celebrities' reputations.
"While no one cheers when a Hollywood celebrity is arrested for DUI [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] or sent to jail for significant crimes, it's not necessarily career-ending," he says.
While the Korean entertainment industry has made moves to address performers' mental health concerns, it is unclear how effective these have been.
Real change can only happen when there is no more financial or attention incentives to continue with such intrusive reporting, says Mr Benjamin.

Headline: Philippine town offers bounty for mosquitoes as dengue rises
Author: Virma Simonette & Joel Guinto, BBC News, in Manila and Singapore
Published Date: 2025-02-19T10:08:41.983Z
Text: Authorities in one of the Philippines' most densely-populated urban centres are offering a cash reward for mosquitoes in an attempt to stop the spread of dengue.
Carlito Cernal, village chief of Barangay Addition Hills in central Manila, announced the bounty of one peso (less than two US cents) for every five mosquitoes.
While news of the bounty has provoked scorn on social media, Mr Cernal has defended it as necessary for the community's health.
The move follows a recent spike in cases of dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes, in the Philippines.
The programme, which will run for at least a month, was started after two students in Mr Cernal's neighbourhood died from the disease.
The bounty applies to all mosquitoes - dead or alive - and their larvae, Mr Cernal added. Live mosquitoes will be exterminated using ultraviolet light.
A total of 21 people have already claimed their reward, bringing in a total of 700 mosquitoes and larvae so far, he told the BBC.
The bounty drew swift ridicule after it was announced late on Tuesday.
"Mosquito farming is coming," one social media comment read. "Will a mosquito get rejected if it has only one wing?" read another.
The Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) told the BBC that it "appreciates the good intentions of local government executives to fight dengue".
It declined further comment, however, when asked if catching mosquitoes in exchange for cash is an effective way of stopping dengue.
"We urge all concerned to please consult and coordinate with their local health officers or the DOH regional office in their area for evidence-based practices that are known to work," it said.
Mr Cernal said he was aware that the bounty had been bashed on social media, but added: "This is one of the biggest and most dense areas. We have to do something to help the local government."
He pointed out that local health authorities recorded 44 cases of dengue in the community during the most recent surge of infections.
Barangay Addition Hills is home to nearly 70,000 people, crammed into a 162-hectare patch at the heart of the capital, Metro Manila.
Mr Cernal said the bounty was meant to supplement existing measures such as cleaning the streets and preventing the build-up of water where dengue-carrying mosquitoes lay their eggs.
Dengue is endemic in tropical countries, and outbreaks often occur in urban areas with poor sanitation which allows virus-carrying mosquitoes to multiply.
In severe cases, dengue causes internal bleeding which can lead to death. Its symptoms include headaches, nausea, joint and muscle pain.
Philippine authorities have recently flagged a rise in dengue cases nationwide due to seasonal rains. The DOH said it recorded 28,234 cases on 1 February, a 40% jump from the previous year.
The department has advised the public to maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings, destroy potential mosquito breeding sites such as tyres, wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers and apply mosquito repellent.
Aside from dengue, the DOH said the rains have also fuelled a spike in influenza-like diseases and cases of leptospirosis, a rat-borne disease that people get when wading in flood waters.

Headline: Man jailed for attempted murder of former Japan PM
Author: Shaimaa Khalil, Japan correspondent, Reporting fromTokyo, Gavin Butler, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore

Text: A man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the attempted murder of Japan's former prime minister Fumio Kishida in 2023.
Ryuji Kimura, 25, hurled a pipe bomb at Kishida as the country's leader approached a crowd for a speech during an election event in the city of Wakayama.
Although Kishida was unharmed, the explosion of the homemade device caused minor injuries to a police officer and a member of the public.
The attack shocked Japan as it came less than a year after former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead at an outdoor election campaign event.
Kimura, who was sentenced on Wednesday, claimed during questioning his intention was not to kill Kishida, but to object to the country's election age regulation which prevented him from getting into politics.
The minimum age to become a member of parliament in Japan is 25 for the House of Representatives and 30 for the House of Councillors.
Kimura further added that he threw the bomb to bring attention to a civil lawsuit he filed in 2022, claiming the age restriction was unconstitutional, which was dismissed.
Kimura's defence argued he should not face a charge of attempted murder, as he did not expect the bomb to cause injuries, and that a three-year prison sentence would be reasonable given the extent of those injuries.
The court stated, however, that the explosives were powerful enough to cause fatal damage.
When handing down the ruling, presiding judge Keiko Fukushima noted that "targeting a serving prime minister caused significant anxiety to society as a whole."
In addition to the attempted murder charge, Kimura was also found guilty of violating explosives regulations and firearms control laws.
His 10-year sentence is five years less than what prosecutors had sought.
While violent attacks are extremely rare in Japan, anxiety around politicians' security has surged in the wake of Abe's assassination in 2022.
The attempted attack on Kishida, which came less than a year later, raised questions as to why there was not a tighter security presence around the country's leader at that time.

Text: Footage release by the Philippine coast guard shows a Chinese navy helicopter flying close to a Philippine aircraft patrolling over a disputed area of the South China Sea on Tuesday, 18 February.
According to the coast guard, the helicopter flew within 3m of the Philippine plane, prompting the pilot to say: "You are flying too close, you are very dangerous," over the radio.
The Philippine government said it would file a formal protest over the incident.
The Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea has been contested between the countries since China seized it from the Philippines in 2012.

Headline: Facing Islamist threats, Bangladesh girls forced to cancel football matches
Author: Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News

Text: Asha Roy, 17, was excited to take part in a women's football tournament, but her hopes were dashed as Islamists forced the organisers to cancel the match in northern Bangladesh.
Shortly before the game began earlier this month, the Islami Andolan Bangladesh group announced a protest rally against the event in Rangpur region, saying it was un-Islamic.
Fearing trouble, local police stepped in and the women's team members were asked to return to their home for their safety.
"I was frustrated and frightened. We had never faced such a situation before. It was disappointing that we came back without playing," Ms Roy told the BBC.
Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, is currently undergoing a political transition after widespread protests ousted its authoritarian government last year.
An interim administration is currently in charge but there are concerns that Islamist groups, which had been pushed to the fringes, have become emboldened again.
The women's football match was the third to be cancelled in northern Bangladesh in less than two weeks due to the objections of religious hardliners.
In the Dinajpur area, roughly 70km (43 miles) west of Rangpur, Islamists protesting against a game clashed with locals who supported it, leaving four people injured.
For girls such as Asha Roy, who come from rural areas, football and other sports are a source of female empowerment and a way out of poverty. Those who shine can be selected to play for sponsored teams and some go on to represent Bangladesh internationally.
Many girls have been inspired to take up football thanks to the success of the national women's team, who are considered heroes after winning two consecutive South Asia Football Championships in recent years.
Ms Roy's teammate, Musammat Tara Moni, said she would not stop playing despite the threats.
"It's my dream to represent our national team. My family supports me, so I am not losing hope," the 16-year-old said.
For their coach Nurul Islam, the objections came as a surprise. "I have taken the team to many tournaments for the past seven years, but it's the first time we have faced a situation like this," he said.
The Islamists insist that the match they stopped was against their religious values and say that they are determined to prevent any future football games.
"If women want to play football, they should cover their entire body, and they can play only in front of female spectators. Men cannot watch them play," Maulana Ashraf Ali, the leader of the Islami Andolan Bangladesh in the Taraganj area of Rangpur, told the BBC.
Mr Ali also insisted that the group "definitely" want hard-line Islamic Sharia law in Bangladesh.
The cancellation of the women's football matches caused an uproar on social media, leading the authorities to reorganise one of them. They have also launched an investigation into the incidents but say the fear of radicalism is exaggerated.
"There is no truth in the allegations that the government is pandering to Islamists," Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, told the BBC.
Mr Alam pointed out that hundreds of women's sports matches were held as part of a national youth festival in January, and that they were played across the country without any trouble.
Some people are not reassured. Samina Luthfa, assistant professor of sociology in the University of Dhaka, told the BBC the cancellation of the women's football matches was "definitely alarming".
"The women of Bangladesh will not stop playing football and will not stop from going to work or doing their things," she said, adding that "everyone will fight" efforts to remove women from public spaces.
Other decisions made by the interim government since it assumed power in August in relation to Islamist hardliners have also raised concerns.
They include revoking a ban on the country's largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, which was introduced in the last days of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's government.
Jashimuddin Rahmani, the leader of banned Islamist militant group Ansarullah Bangladesh (ABT) - now known as Ansar al Islam - was released in August after a court granted him bail. He was sentenced to five years in prison in connection with the killing of a secular blogger in 2013, but had been kept behind bars because of other pending cases.
According to local media reports, several other people accused of having links with extremist groups have also been given bail in the past few months.
"Though security forces say they will monitor those released, it will be difficult for them to put everybody under surveillance given the limitations," says Dr Tawohidul Haque, a crime analyst from the University of Dhaka.
While most Bangladeshis practise moderate Islam and secular values dominate society, Islamic extremism is not a new phenomenon in the country. A decade ago, religious zealots targeted secular bloggers, atheists, minorities, foreigners and others in a spate of attacks - killing dozens and sending others fleeing abroad.
In one such incident, a group of Islamist gunmen stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka in 2016, killing 20 people.
It is not just women's football games that have been targeted recently either. Last week, dozens of Islamist students vandalised a book stall at Dhaka's famous Ekushey Book Fair.
The protesters were angry over the display a book by the exiled feminist author Taslima Nasrin, who has in the past received death threats from Islamist groups for what they say are her blasphemous writings.
Muhammad Yunus condemned the incident saying the attack "shows contempt for both the rights of Bangladeshi citizens and for the laws of our country." The police are investigating.
Meanwhile, one of the country's best-known actors, Pori Moni said she was stopped from inaugurating a department store in the northern town of Tangail after reported objections from religious groups.
"Now I'm really feeling helpless, as well as insecure. It's part of my job to take part in opening a showroom or a similar event. No one has stopped me all these years," Ms Moni told the BBC Bengali service.
Similar events involving two other actors, Apu Biswas and Mehazabien Chowdhury, have also been cancelled following threats by Islamists.
Minority groups like the Sufi Muslims say they are also witnessing increasing attacks on their places of worship. Islamist extremists view Sufism as heretical.
"About a hundred of our shrines [mazars] and centres have been attacked in the past six months," Anisur Rahman Jafri, Secretary General of the Sufism Universal Foundation, told the BBC.
"We have not seen this kind of sudden extremist attack on us since the country's independence in 1971," he added, warning that the country was at risk of "Talibanisation" if the situation continued.
Police said only 40 shrines were damaged and that they had stepped up security around religious sites.
The authorities have also been struggling to maintain law and order in the wake of Sheikh Hasina's departure. Earlier this month, thousands of protesters vandalised homes and buildings connected to Hasina and senior leaders of her Awami League party.
People from other groups and parties, including Islamists, joined in other demonstrations in the capital, Dhaka, and across the country.
The authorities have defended the security forces for not intervening, saying doing so would have cost lives.
Rights groups have expressed concern over the security situation.
"If the government fails to act, then Islamists are going to feel emboldened. There will be more self-censorship for women and girls, they will be more intimidated participating in public events," Shireen Huq, a prominent women's rights activist, told the BBC.
"I am still optimistic that this phenomenon will not sustain," she added.

Headline: India seeks AI breakthrough - but is it falling behind?
Author: Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, @Nik_inamdar
Published Date: 2025-02-18T22:13:55.320Z
Text: Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, China's DeepSeek has sent ripples through the tech industry by collapsing the cost for developing generative artificial intelligence applications.
But as the global race for AI supremacy heats up, India appears to have fallen behind, especially in creating its own foundational language model that's used to power things like chatbots.
The government claims a homegrown equivalent to DeepSeek isn't far away. It is supplying startups, universities and researchers with thousands of high-end chips needed to develop it in under 10 months.
A flurry of global AI leaders have also been talking up India's capabilities recently.
After being initially dismissive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this month said India should be playing a leading role in the AI revolution. The country is now OpenAI's second largest market by users.
Others like Microsoft have put serious money on the table – committing $3bn (£2.4bn) for cloud and AI infrastructure. Nvidia's Jensen Huang also spoke of India's "unmatched" technical talent as a key to unlocking its future potential.
With 200 startups working on generative AI, there's enough entrepreneurial activity under way too.
But despite having key ingredients for success in place, India risks lagging behind without basic structural fixes to education, research and state policy, experts say.
China and the US already have a "four to five year head-start", having invested heavily in research and academia and developed AI for military applications, law enforcement and now large language models, technology analyst Prasanto Roy told the BBC.
Though in the top five globally on Stanford's AI Vibrancy Index – which ranks countries on metrics such as patents, funding, policy and research – India is still far behind the two superpowers in many key areas.
China and the US were granted 60% and 20% of the world's total AI patents between 2010 and 2022 respectively. India got less than half a percent.
India's AI startups also received a fraction of the private investment that US and Chinese companies got in 2023.
India's state-funded AI mission, meanwhile, is worth a trifling $1bn compared with the staggering $500bn the US has earmarked for Stargate - a plan to build massive AI infrastructure in the US - or China's reported $137bn initiative to become an AI hub by 2030.
While DeepSeek's success has demonstrated that AI models can be built on older, less expensive chips - something India can take solace from - lack of "patient" or long-term capital from either industry or government is a major problem, says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of a consultancy that builds AI literacy in organisations.
"Despite what has been heard about DeepSeek developing a model with $5.6m, there was much more capital behind it."
Lack of high-quality India-specific datasets required for training AI models in regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil is another problem, especially given India's language diversity.
But for all its issues, India punches far above its weight on talent – with 15% of the world's AI workers coming from the country.
The issue though, as Stanford's AI talent migration research shows, is that more and more of them are choosing to leave the country.
This is partly because "foundational AI innovations typically come from deep R&D in universities and corporate research labs", Mr Bindra says.
And India lacks a supporting research environment, with few deep-tech breakthroughs emerging from its academic and corporate sectors.
The enormous success of India's payments revolution was due to strong government-industry-academia collaboration - a similar model, he says, needs to be replicated for the AI push.
The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a digital payment system developed by a government organisation, has revolutionised digital payments in India, allowing millions to transact at the click of a button or by scanning a QR code.
Bengaluru's $200bn outsourcing industry, home to millions of coders, should have ideally been at the forefront of India's AI ambitions. But the IT companies have never really shifted their focus from cheap service-based work to developing foundational consumer AI technologies.
"It's a huge gap which they left to the startups to fill," says Mr Roy.
He's unsure though whether startups and government missions can do this heavy lifting quickly enough, adding that the 10-month timeline set by the minster was a knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek's sudden emergence.
"I don't think India will be able to produce anything like DeepSeek at least for the next few years," he adds. It is a view many others share.
India can, however, continue to build and tweak applications upon existing open source platforms like DeepSeek "to leapfrog our own AI progress", Bhavish Agarwal, founder of one of India's earliest AI startups Krutrim, recently wrote on X.
In the longer run though, developing a foundational model will be critical to have strategic autonomy in the sector and reduce import dependencies and threats of sanctions, say experts.
India will also need to increase its computational power or hardware infrastructure to run such models, which means manufacturing semiconductors - something that's not taken off yet.
Much of this will need to fall in place before the gap with the US and China is narrowed meaningfully.

Headline: Japan to increase reliance on nuclear energy in post-Fukushima shift
Author: Shaimaa Khalil, Tokyo correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-18T11:38:11.536Z
Text: Japan says it will increase its reliance on nuclear energy in a major policy shift as it seeks to meet growing demand from power-hungry sectors like AI and semiconductors.
An energy plan approved by the cabinet on Tuesday called for "maximising the use of nuclear energy" and dropped reference to "reducing reliance on nuclear energy".
The energy plan, written by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry says that by 2040, nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan's grid supply in 2040, more than double the 8.5% share in 2023.
It comes as the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster from 14 years ago continues to hang over the country, conjuring painful memories.
In March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake near Japan's north-east coast spawned a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people, wiping out entire towns and flooding the reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi plant.
Japan now operates 14 commercial nuclear reactors, compared to 54 before the Fukushima disaster when 30% of the country's energy was from nuclear sources.
The plan still needs approval by parliament, where it will be discussed in the coming months.
The country, which imports 90% of its fuel, needs to look to nuclear sources as part of its plan to cut back on carbon and be self-reliant on energy, said Daishiro Yamagiwa, an MP who was part of a government advisory committee on the energy plan.
"Because of the conflict in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East, even fossil fuels have become difficult to buy," he told the BBC. "Japan is a country without energy resources, so we must use whatever is available in a balanced way."
Yamagiwa added that energy burdens are growing because of demand from AI data processing centres and semiconductor factories around the country.
But experts say increasing reliance on nuclear energy will be both risky and costly.
Japan will need to import uranium, which is expensive and will make the country reliant on other countries, said Professor Kenichi Oshima at the faculty of policy science at Ryukoku University.
Prof Oshima told the BBC the main concern is that increasing the number of nuclear power plants also raises the risk of potentially disastrous accidents.
He cited the 2024 New Year's Day earthquake in the Noto peninsula, where two decades ago, a plan to build a nuclear plant was scrapped because locals opposed it.
"If there had been a nuclear power plant there, it is quite clear that it would have caused a major accident," he said.
In Japan, any mention of nuclear energy inevitably brings back difficult memories of the nuclear meltdown at the Daiichi power plant.
"We all had such a terrible experience at the time of the Fukushima quake," Tokyo resident Yuko Maruyama told the BBC.
"How could I support it [the nuclear energy plan]? I want the government to rely on other sources of energy," she added.
"As a mother I think of the children, of their safety. I cannot help but think about what would happen in the future."
The meltdown at Fukushima is considered the world's worst since that of Chernobyl in 1986.
It stirred fresh controversy in 2023, when Japan started releasing treated water from the site of the Fukushima plant. This drew protests from Japan's neighbours, including China, over safety concerns.
The United Nations atomic energy regulator IAEA said the waste water was safe and would have a "negligible" impact on people and the environment.
In response to the new energy plan announced this week, Greenpeace said promoting nuclear energy is "outrageous" when the fallout from Fukushima is still ongoing.
"There is no justification for continuing to rely on nuclear energy, which remains toxic for tens of thousands of years, produces radioactive waste that requires long-term management, and carries risks like earthquakes and terrorism," the group said.
To meet the government's goal, experts say 33 reactors must be put back online, but the current pace of safety checks as well as residents' objections in some areas will make this difficult.
Many of these nuclear plants are old and will need to be refitted with new technology for them to function safely.
"That most difficult problem is that each nuclear power plant is in a different location and will need its own safety protocol and infrastructure," Yamagiwa said.
"We must check each of them carefully. It still takes time."
In recent months, regulators have given several old reactors approval to keep operating.
In October 2024 Japan's oldest reactor, Takahama nuclear power plant, was given the go-ahead to continue operations, making it the first reactor in the country to get approval to operate beyond 50 years.

Headline: 'Everyone must go': New Zealand's tourism drive draws ire
Author: Koh Ewe, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-18T09:41:10.910Z
Text: Depending on how you read it, New Zealand's latest tourism tagline can be a well-meaning plea for people to visit - or a threat to kick Kiwis out.
"Everyone Must Go!" reads a slogan printed across posters of people in New Zealand's majestic landscapes - part of a NZ$500,000 ($285,000; £227,000) campaign unveiled on Sunday.
But what was meant as a catchy call to action aimed at Australian tourists has been accused of being tone-deaf, as New Zealand deals with record emigration rates and unemployment.
The government has defended the campaign, with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying he "[appreciates] there's lots of chat about whether everyone loves the slogan or not".
"The fact that we're talking about it is a good thing. It's a great thing," he added.
Cushla Tangaere-Manuel, tourism spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told local news outlet Radio New Zealand (RNZ) that the new slogan "makes New Zealand sound like we're in a clearance bin at a sale".
"The irony of that messaging is, that's how Aotearoa New Zealanders are feeling right now," she said, pointing to the "many cuts" that residents have experienced.
Job cuts to the public sector over the past year, as part of the government's austerity push, have affected thousands of people.
Meanwhile, people are moving out of the country in record numbers. Official figures show that there were nearly 130,000 departures last year - though that was offset by the arrival of nearly 160,000 immigrants.
"New Zealanders are voting with their feet, leaving in record high numbers," Labour MP Barbara Edmonds wrote on X on Monday. "Is their real tourism plan 'Everyone Must Go' - for Kiwis?"
Others associated the slogan with demand for lavatories.
"I think 'Everyone Must Go' might refer to the need for toilets in some of our high-tourist spots. I mean, the queues are ridiculous," Green Party MP Celia Wade-Brown told RNZ.
"They don't go kayaking, they don't go diving, but, my goodness, they queue at the toilets."
Tourism minister Louise Upston said in a statement on Sunday that "the campaign tagline of 'Everyone must go' lets Australia know that New Zealand is a 'must visit' destination, and that we're ready and waiting to welcome them now".
New Zealand's tourism numbers have yet to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, and authorities are channelling efforts into attracting visitors from neighbouring Australia, its largest source of tourists.
Last year, New Zealand welcomed more than 1.2 million visitors from Australia. But Upston said visitors numbers were only 88% of that in 2019.
Luxon said he hoped the latest campaign would boost Australian visitor numbers by 5%.
"It would be totally and utterly tragic if those Australians don't get here before they do die," he said.
The month-long tourism campaign is set to start on Thursday.

Headline: 'Died for stealing chocolate': Pakistan anger over death of child maid
Author: Azadeh Moshiri, Pakistan correspondent, Usman Zahid, BBC News

Text: A couple in north-east Pakistan has been detained on suspicion of murdering a 13-year-old girl who worked for them as a maid, for allegedly stealing chocolates.
The girl who goes only by one name, Iqra, succumbed to multiple injuries in hospital last Wednesday. A preliminary police investigation said she had been tortured.
The case in Rawalpindi has sparked widespread outrage and posts with the hashtag #JusticeforIqra having garnered tens of thousands of views, and reignited a debate over child labour and the mistreatment of domestic workers.
Laws pertaining to child labour can vary across the country, but children under the age of 15 cannot be employed as domestic workers in the province of Punjab.
"I felt completely shattered inside when she died," Iqra's father, Sana Ullah, told the BBC.
He said that he had received a call from the police about Iqra last Wednesday. When he rushed to the hospital, he saw Iqra lying on a bed, unconscious. She died minutes later.
Iqra began working as a maid from the age of eight. Her father, a 45-year-old farmer, said he had sent her to work because he was in debt.
After working for a few employers, she went to work for the couple two years ago, who have eight children of their own. She was earning about £23 ($28) per month.
Police said Iqra had been accused of stealing chocolates from her employers, adding that a preliminary investigation showed that Iqra had been tortured.
Police also say there was evidence of frequent abuse. Pictures and videos obtained by the BBC showed multiple fractures in her legs and arms, as well as a serious injury to her head.
An autopsy is being conducted to assess the full extent of her injuries, and the police has told the BBC that they were still awaiting the final medical report.
"My heart cries tears of blood. How many... are subjected to violence in their homes every day for a trivial job of a few thousand?" activist Shehr Bano wrote on X. "How long will the poor continue to lower their daughters into graves in this way?"
Others have pointed out that her murder was allegedly triggered by something so minor.
"She died over chocolate?" asked one Pakistani user on X.
"This is not just a crime, it's a reflection of [a] system that enables [the] rich to treat [the] poor as disposable," another said.
Iqra's employers, Rashid Shafiq and his wife Sana, have been arrested, along with a Quran teacher, who worked for the family. The teacher had brought Iqra to the hospital and left after telling hospital staff that the girl's father had died and her mother was not around.
Police told the BBC it was unclear if she believed this to be the truth.
Iqra's father says he wants to see "those responsible for my daughter's death punished".
Despite the public outrage such cases usually garner, they are typically settled out of court and it's rare for suspects to be successfully prosecuted.
In 2018, a judge and his wife were sentenced to three years in jail for torturing their then 10-year-old maid in what had been a highly publicised case that sparked outrage across the country. But they later had their sentences reduced to one year.
Tayyaba was found with severe injuries, which the Pakistan Institute of Medical Science said included burns to her hands and feet. Pictures of the girl also showed cuts and bruising to her face, along with a swollen left eye. She told prosecutors she was beaten for losing a broom.
Under Pakistani law, victims or their families have the right to forgive suspects in a number of serious crimes. To do so, they have to state in court that they forgive a suspect "in the name of God".
In reality, legal observers say that the primary motive for that "forgiveness" is normally financial, and paying victims is not illegal.
About 3.3 million children in Pakistan are engaged in child labour, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). Moreover, women and young girls make up the vast majority of Pakistan's 8.5 million domestic workers, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

Headline: Pritam Singh: Singapore opposition leader guilty of lying to parliament

Published Date: 2025-02-17T08:35:46.544Z
Text: Singapore's opposition leader Pritam Singh has been found guilty of lying under oath to a parliamentary committee.
A court imposed the maximum fine of S$7,000 ($5,223; £4,148) for each of two charges. Singh said that he would appeal against the conviction and sentence.
The charges relate to Singh's handling of Raeesah Khan, a former lawmaker from his party, who lied to parliament in a separate case.
The verdict in this high-profile trial comes as Singapore is gearing up for its next general election, which must be held by November. Singh's Workers' Party holds nine out of 87 elected seats in parliament.
Under Singapore's constitution, any MP can lose their seat or be barred from running for office for five years if they are fined at least S$10,000 or jailed for more than a year.
The election department has since clarified that the S$10,000 threshold only applies to a single offence, according to local media. This means Singh's fines will not trigger disqualification.
"The question on most people's minds is the consequences for the upcoming election," Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC.
Singh's case could either be "played up" by state media or "fizzle out" of public attention, he said.
Singh told reporters outside the court on Monday that he intended to run in the upcoming election.
The verdict on Monday, which lasted more than two hours, was delivered to a packed courtroom. Members of the press who could not fit into the courtroom, including the BBC, viewed a livestream of the verdict from a separate room.
District Judge Luke Tan, who delivered the verdict, said several pieces of evidence showed that Singh "never wanted Ms Khan to clarify [her] lie" and had "direct and intimate involvement" in guiding Khan to continue her narrative.
Prosecutors sought the maximum fine of S$7,000 for each of Singh's two charges, while the defence asked for S$4,000.
Singh, 48, maintained his innocence throughout the trial, arguing that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue.
Singh's case has gripped the city-state, where a usually uneventful political scene - dominated by the ruling People's Action Party - has in recent years seen a rare string of scandals.
The saga started in August 2021 when Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed the police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim. She later admitted that her anecdote was not true.
Khan was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege. She has since resigned from the party and parliament.
During a parliamentary committee investigation into the incident later that year, Khan testified that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to "continue with the narrative" despite finding out that it was not true. This was prior to her eventual admission.
Singh denied this, but also said that he had given Khan "too much time to settle herself before closing this issue with her".
The parliamentary committee concluded that Singh was not being truthful and referred the case to the public prosecutor.
Judge Tan said on Monday that Singh's actions after learning of Khan's lie were "strongly indicative that the accused did not want Ms Khan to clarify the untruth at some point".
Singh's Workers' Party is the opposition party with the largest presence in parliament.
The party made significant gains during the 2020 election, increasing their number of seats from six to 10 - the biggest victory for the opposition since Singapore gained independence in 1965. Singh was named the opposition leader after the polls.
One of those seats has since been vacated by Khan.

Headline: Special Forces rejected 2,000 credible asylum claims from Afghan commandos, MoD confirms
Author: Hannah O'Grady, Joel Gunter, and Rory Tinman, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-17T00:01:35.934Z
Text: UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.
UK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.
The MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.
Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.
The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.
The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.
The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.
BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.
The MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.
The confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.
Documents disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.
Mike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were "extremely concerning".
"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry," Martin said.
"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry," he added.
Johnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard "horrific" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.
Mercer said it was "very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry".
The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as "credible" evidence of service with the Triples units.
The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.
Many are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.
"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people," said a former Triples officer. "The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives," he said.
The officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces "like brothers" and felt "betrayed" by the widespread rejections.
"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer," he said.
The MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.
The legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.
"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions," said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.
"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at."
Lawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.
In court filings, they criticised the "total inadequacy" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an "an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation" of the process.
New evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.
The MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role "evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior".
But officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.
"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all," said former officer who served with UKSF.
"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations," he said.
The Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: "There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry."

Text: South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron has been found dead in Seoul, police have said.
The 24-year-old was found in her home in the city's Seongsu-dong district by a friend at around 16:55 (07:55 GMT) on Sunday.
Officers said no signs of foul play had been found and they were investigating the cause of death.
Kim began her career as a child actor and was seen as one of South Korea's most promising young actresses.
Born in Seoul in 2000, she rose to prominence with her role in 2009 film A Brand New Life - which saw her appear at the Cannes Film Festival.
She went on to star in South Korea's highest grossing film of 2010 The Man from Nowhere and 2012 thriller The Neighbour, for which she received award recognition.
Other notable roles include the 2014 film A Girl at My Door and television roles such as Mirror of the Witch in 2016.
The actress largely withdrew from the public eye in 2022 due to a drink driving incident, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023.
Kim's last role was in Netflix's 2023 Korean drama Bloodhounds. Variety reported that most of her role was edited out due to the driving incident.

Headline: Families' heartbreak after deadly Delhi railway station crush

Text: On Sunday morning, the New Delhi Railway Station in India's capital looked much like it always does: bustling, with its many platforms full of eager, impatient passengers waiting to catch their trains.
But on Saturday night, a deadly crush - reportedly caused by overcrowding - killed at least 18 people and left several injured.
According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj city where the massive Hindu religious festival, Kumbh Mela, is being held - was waiting to depart as people pushed against each other.
The crush occurred after "a passenger slipped and fell on the stairs", a spokesperson for Indian Railways said.
Opposition leaders have criticised the government, alleging that Indian Railways did not make adequate arrangements to manage crowds at the station.
An investigation has been launched, and authorities have announced compensation for the victims.
When asked by the BBC about safety and security at the station, Pankaj Gangwar, Principal Chief Security Commissioner of Northern Railway, said "let the investigation be completed first".
Crushes like these are not unheard of in India, where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces. Last month, 30 people were killed and dozens injured in a crush at the Kumbh Mela.
Crowds at the railway station were also not unexpected - trains are by far the cheapest long-distance mode of transport in India and it is common for the number of passengers to far exceed the capacity of trains.
Eyewitnesses and the families of victims have been recounting their ordeal. Many of them were angry at authorities and police officials at the railway station, who they say did not act in time.
Some eyewitnesses said the crush was not limited to one place but took place on the overhead bridge, staircases and platforms.
Bipin Jha was at the station to meet his wife Mamta, who was arriving on a train. She died in the crush.
"I met her at the platform and we were walking on the footbridge overhead when she was trapped in the crush. She died in front of my eyes. I will live my life with the guilt of not saving her," he says.
"We were on the stairs, suddenly we felt a push from behind. We fell, along with many others, and were trapped under bodies. I was barely breathing," said Seema, whose sister-in law Pinky Devi died on the staircase.
Usha Devi, who was travelling to the eastern state of Bihar for her nephew's wedding, said chaos erupted the moment she reached the platform.
"Many people fell. Everywhere, there were scattered belongings, food items and clothes. I was on the verge of fainting. So many people were collapsing. The crowd was so dense that we couldn't board our train."
Umesh Giri's wife Shilam Devi was among the victims.
"The crowd became uncontrollable," he told BBC Hindi while waiting outside the mortuary at Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College.
"I saw several bodies already lying there. People were colliding with each other, and others started falling over them," said Mr Giri, who was also injured.
He added that help took time to arrive and that he pleaded with officers for help.
Senior police and railway officials at the scene did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
Most of the victims were taken to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital in New Delhi, where police and paramilitary forces were deployed, and railway authorities had set up a help desk to assist families. Journalists were not allowed to enter the hospital on Saturday.
Relatives of victims shared their grief with reporters waiting outside, while also expressing anger at the facilities in the hospital.
"Multiple people were crammed onto a single bed," alleged Shobha, the sister-in-law of Shilam Devi.
Others coming out of the hospital also confirmed this. Hospital authorities did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
At Lady Hardinge Hospital, the grieving family of Riya, 7, completed the paperwork so they could receive her body.
"No child deserves to die like this", her uncle Vivek said, wiping away tears.

Text: A crush at New Delhi Railway Station has left around 18 people dead and at least 10 injured.
Thousands of people reportedly crammed into the railway station on Saturday night as they tried to board delayed trains.
Four of the victims were children, while 10 were women, according to a list released by officials.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his thoughts were "with all those who have lost their loved ones" in a post on X.
Crowd crushes are common in India where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces.
The incident comes weeks after 30 people were killed in a pre-dawn crush at the religious festival, Kumbh Mela, in northern India, where tens of millions of Hindus had gathered to bathe in sacred river waters on one of the holy days of the six-week event.
In Delhi, witnesses told BBC Hindi that a "huge crowd" had gathered at the station, through which many people were travelling to and from the Kumbh Mela, which is being held in Prayagraj city in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state. Hundreds of people were also waiting for trains to other places.
According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj - was waiting to depart.
Ruby Devi said the crowd at the Indian capital's main railway station had been so big she was unable to get inside.
Umesh Giri, whose wife Shilam Devi died in the crush, said that the crowd was "uncontrollable" as he tried to board the Prayagraj Express.
Dharmendra Singh, who was also travelling to Prayagraj, told India's PTI news agency that there were" far more people than I have ever seen at this station".
"In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers.
KPS Malhotra, deputy commissioner of police (railways), said that authorities were investigating what led to the crush.
"This happened due to a delay in two trains arriving and more people gathering at the station," he said.
Opposition leaders have criticised the government, accusing them of administrative failure.
"Considering the large number of devotees going to Prayagraj, better arrangements should have been made at the station," Rahul Gandhi, the leader of opposition in India's parliament, posted on X.

Headline: 'I believe in my guide runner more than myself', says blind Indian athlete
Author: Divya Arya, BBC Hindi
Published Date: 2025-02-16T01:23:40.373Z
Text: "When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste'," says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. "It makes me so proud," she says.
Rakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.
"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me," she says.
When Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.
"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'" she recalls.
Her teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.
For a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.
A middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.
There was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.
However, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. "I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country," he says.
He invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.
When they are running "it's the small things that matter", says Rahul. "When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort."
Competition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.
Over time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now "I believe in my guide runner more than myself", says Rakshitha.
They won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.
Rakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.
They missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.
Simran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.
But in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.
But the search proved challenging. "It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do," she explains.
Simran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.
"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy'," he says. "But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult." Every movement has to be synchronised.
Simran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.
Their first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.
"Neither of us knew the rules properly," says Simran. Abhay "thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.
But by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.
Riding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.
But Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.
Although guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.
"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities," says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.
Both Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.
Despite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. "I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal," she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.
Rakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. "She must win a medal," he says. "There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them."

Headline: The A-level student who became an enemy of the Chinese state
Author: Frances Mao, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon
Published Date: 2025-02-16T00:00:27.535Z
Text: Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents.
The choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($128,000; £102,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad.
"I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school," Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. "But I've ended up with a bounty!"
Chloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago.
In 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels.
Her protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the café in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest.
Hong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her – in which she is aged 11.
"It freaked me out at first," she says, but then she fired back a public response.
"I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them."
Chloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997.
"Politics were never in my life before… so I went to the first protest with curiosity," she said.
She saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck.
"I was so shocked," she says. "That moment actually changed how I looked at the world."
Growing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms – she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about "what we like and don't like" and "could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like".
But the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge.
"I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics]," she says. But when things started to get "really crazy", she browbeat her parents into coming with her.
At the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the "raw experience", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV.
After months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020.
The authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong argue the law is necessary to maintain stability and has not weakened the city's autonomy. But most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies – were suddenly gone.
Symbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail.
In response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown.
At first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around.
Unable to afford international student fees of more than £20,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO.
When China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target.
Her inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas. A Hong Kong government statement said: "Any individuals who endanger national security should not believe that being overseas will allow them to evade criminal responsibility.
"We must emphasise that the Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people."
Chloe says the bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK.
China has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week.
Another Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors.
And last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances.
"They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others," Chloe says.
She says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong.
"Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks," she says. "It's sad but we can't blame them."
On the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate "any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK.
But more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster.
In the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: "We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK."
But she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers.
"We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China."
Does she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says.
"When I think of what [they] face… it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas."
Bounty targets
Update 18 February 2025: This article has been updated to include a response from the Hong Kong government.

Headline: India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died
Author: Geeta Pandey, BBC News, London•@geetapandeybbc, •

Text: Warning: This report contains some disturbing details
An Indian court's ruling that a man's forced "unnatural sex" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.
The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.
Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.
The lower court had also found the man guilty of "culpable homicide not amounting to murder". He was sentenced to "rigorous imprisonment for 10 years" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.
But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.
The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.
"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent," said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.
"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system," she told the BBC.
"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly."
Priyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this "sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder".
She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger.
"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died."
The court documents make for grim reading.
According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, "committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will… causing her a lot of pain".
After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.
In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill "due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband".
A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.
While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated "the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.
Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently – he questioned the "sanctity" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.
The lower court's conviction was "a rarest of rare case", Ms Shukla said, "probably because the woman died".
"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge."
Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.
India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.
A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.
The British colonial-era law mentions several "exemptions" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is "by a man with his own wife" if she is not under 15 years.
Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.
The idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is "implied" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.
But in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.
The Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move.
In October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be "excessively harsh". The federal home ministry said it "may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage".
Authorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.
"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom," Ms Chauhan said.
"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?" she asks.
Violence within marriage is rampant in India.
According to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% of married women, aged 18-49, who have experienced sexual violence said their current husbands were the perpetrators.
And even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.
"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome," the lawyer said.
Ms Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.
"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out."
She added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a "man versus woman debate".
"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?"

Headline: Japanese woman arrested for squashing bun in shop

Text: A woman in Japan has been arrested for allegedly squashing a bun at a convenience store and leaving without buying the packet of bread.
Authorities in the southern city of Fukuoka confirmed to the BBC that the 40-year-old had been arrested on Monday for "criminal damage".
The woman, who said she was unemployed, claimed she "only checked the firmness of [the bun] by pressing lightly with my hand", according to police.
The woman had allegedly touched a bag of four black sesame and cream cheese buns. While the bag's wrapper was intact, police said one of the buns was damaged after she pressed it with her right thumb, and the entire bag could not be sold.
Police said the owner of the Lawson convenience store had claimed he had seen the woman squashing buns several times in the past.
As the woman was leaving the shop on Monday, the owner noticed the bun was damaged and he urged her to pay for the bread, according to police. The bag of buns cost about 180 yen (£0.95; $1.20).
She allegedly refused. After following her for 1km (0.6mi), the manager restrained her. The police were called to the scene and they arrested her.
In recent years, police have been also cracking down on pranksters who have committed "sushi terrorism" in sushi conveyor belt restaurants, such as licking communal soy sauce bottles and squashing sushi meant for diners.

Headline: Why Muslims in India are opposing changes to a property law

Text: A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country.
The properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board.
The new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion.
On 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders.
They claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation.
The new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.
But several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.
In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.
A vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.
The tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.
The properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.
The government says that the waqf boards are among India’s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; £11.26bn).
Muslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land.
But critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies – which too requires immediate attention.
A report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed.
The committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; £1.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.
The committee also noted that “encroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common”, listing hundreds of instances of such “unauthorised occupation” of waqf land by government authorities.
According to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.
The amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.
Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.
But many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.
One of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.
Many of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.
The 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of “waqf by user”, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.
Professor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.
“You can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,” Prof Rehman says.
Others worry that the new bill may not address the community’s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.
That's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members.
Some agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular.
But the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. “There seems to be an attempt not only to get the state’s control over Muslims’ properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community’s lives.”
Among other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf’s claim to a property is valid.
Critics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.
Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.
The current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.
But some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established.
"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,” Owaisi recently told reporters.
This process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.
“The diagnosis may be correct,” Prof Rehman says, “but the treatment is not.”

Headline: Direct rule in violence-hit Indian state after chief minister quits

Text: The Indian government has brought the troubled north-eastern state of Manipur under direct federal rule days after Chief Minister N Biren Singh resigned.
Singh, from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quit on Sunday after facing months of pressure to step down.
Ethnic clashes broke out between the state's majority Meitei and minority Kuki communities in May 2023 over economic benefits, land rights and job quotas.
More than 250 people have been killed in the conflict and tens of thousands displaced.
The state hit the global headlines in July 2023 when a video showing two women being paraded naked by a mob went viral, sparking outrage in India.
While the scale of unrest has reduced since the peak in 2023, divisions between the communities persist and violent incidents continue to occur.
Singh's position had become increasingly untenable in recent months with Kuki groups accusing him of favouring the Meitei community, of which he is a member - an accusation he denied.
Media reports said there was also rising discontent against him within the BJP.
BJP leaders tried but failed to agree on someone to replace him as chief minister.
On Thursday evening, the office of President Droupadi Murmu announced that federal rule - known as President's rule in India - had been imposed in the state.
"After receiving a report from the governor and after considering the report and other information received by me, I am satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India," the statement said.
Manipur's last assembly session was held in August and Monday was set to be the first day of the new session, but federally-appointed governor Ajay Bhalla released a statement declaring the session "null and void".
Earlier, opposition Congress party members had said they would bring a no-confidence motion against the chief minister during the session.
Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told the ANI news agency that Singh resigned as he sensed the motion would be passed. Ramesh called for federal Home Minister Amit Shah to resign.
Opposition leaders have also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has not visited the state since the violence began.
Meanwhile India's Supreme Court is hearing a plea against Singh filed by a Kuki organisation which accuses him of playing a direct role in fuelling the violence. The petitioners have submitted leaked audio tapes to back up their claims.
The court has sought a forensic report on the tapes before the next hearing. Singh has denied any wrongdoing.
The conflict involves the state's two largest ethnic groups, the majority Meitei and minority Kuki, and their battle over land and influence.
Tensions boiled over in May 2023 when Kukis began protesting against demands from the Meiteis to be given official tribal status. The Kukis argued this would strengthen the Meiteis' already strong influence on government and society, allowing them to buy land or settle in predominantly Kuki areas.
But there are myriad underlying reasons. The Kukis say a war on drugs waged by the Meitei-led government is a screen to uproot their communities.
Since the violence, Manipur has been divided into two camps, with Meiteis inhabiting the Imphal Valley and the Kukis living in the surrounding hill areas. Borders and buffer zones guarded by security forces and community members separate the two regions.
Efforts to hold peace talks between the communities by federal and state officials have so far failed to end the conflict.

Headline: Hundreds of foreigners freed from Myanmar's scam centres

Text: More than 250 people from 20 nationalities who had been working in telecom fraud centres in Myanmar's Karen State have been released by an ethnic armed group and brought to Thailand.
The workers, almost all of whom were from African or Asian nations, were received by the Thai army, and are being assessed to find out if they were victims of human trafficking.
Last week Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and promised to shut down the scam centres which have proliferated along the Thai-Myanmar border.
Her government has stopped access to power and fuel from the Thai side of the border, and toughened up banking and visa rules to try to prevent scam operators from using Thailand as a transit country for moving workers and cash.
Some opposition MPs in Thailand have been pushing for this kind of action for the past two years.
Foreign workers are typically lured to these scam centres by offers of good salaries, or in some cases tricked into thinking they will be doing different work in Thailand, not Myanmar.
The scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and Chinese.
They are pressed into conducting online criminal activity, ranging from love scams known as "pig butchering" and crypto fraud, to money laundering and illegal gambling.
Some are willing to do the work, but others are forced to stay, with release only possible if their families pay large ransoms. Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured.
The released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State.
These armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds.
The Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948.
On Tuesday, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army.
The warrants included Saw Chit Thu, the Karen warlord who struck a deal in 2017 with a Chinese company to build Shwe Kokko, a new city believed to be largely funded by scams.
The BBC visited Shwe Kokko at the invitation of Yatai, the company which built the city.
Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour is not allowed, and that "online businesses" should leave.
But we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one.
Like the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military.
Under pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories.
The DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers.
They included 221 men and 39 women, from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Uganda, Laos, Burundi, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sir Lanka, India, Ghana and Cambodia.

Headline: Why India fails to protect its domestic workers despite decades of abuse
Author: Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai
Published Date: 2025-02-12T22:18:12.482Z
Text: Smitha (not her real name), a domestic helper in Delhi for 28 years, can't forget the day she was beaten in public by one of her employers.
The woman had accused Smitha - a Dalit woman from the most discriminated against caste in Hinduism's entrenched social hierarchy - of stealing her daughter's earrings and then refused to pay her.
"After many requests, I confronted her in public. That's when she started abusing and hitting me. I held her hands to stop the abuse but the guards came and dragged me out of the housing society and locked the gate," Smitha says.
She was eventually paid – a measly 1,000 rupees [$11; £9] for a month of sweeping, mopping and washing dishes – after a more sympathetic family intervened on her behalf. But she was banned from entering the housing community and did not bother going to the police as she believed they would not take action.
Smitha's story is one among hundreds of thousands of accounts of mistreatment, abuse and sexual assault reported by India's domestic workers. Most are women and many are migrants within the country, belonging to castes that are looked down upon.
Last month, India's Supreme Court raised concerns over their exploitation and asked the federal government to look into creating a law to protect them from abuse.
But this isn't the first time that an attempt has been made to create such a legal framework. Despite years of advocacy by various groups and federal ministries, no such law has ever been passed.
Separate bills proposed in 2008 and 2016, aimed at registering domestic workers and improving their working conditions, have not yet been passed. A national policy drafted in 2019 aimed at including domestic workers under existing labour laws has not been implemented.
Sonia George of the Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa), who was part of the task force that formulated the draft policy, calls it one of the "most comprehensive policies for domestic workers" yet, but says that successive governments have failed to implement it.
As a result, India's vast army of domestic helpers must rely on employer goodwill for basics such as wages or leave or even a baseline of respect. According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million.
"We have a patronising relationship with the help and not a labour employment relationship," says Professor Neetha N from the Centre for Women's Development Studies.
"This maintains the status quo and is one of the biggest hurdles to regulating and legalising domestic work."
As things stand, private homes are not considered to be an establishment or workplace, so domestic work falls outside the purview of social protections such as minimum wages, the right to safe working conditions, the right to unionise and access to social security schemes.
At least 14 Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have mandated minimum wages for domestic workers and some federal laws, like India's anti-sexual harassment and child labour laws, include domestic workers in their scope.
But there is very little awareness among domestic workers that they can take advantage of these provisions, Ms George says, adding that the nature of the profession also poses challenges.
Workers are scattered and there is no mechanism to register or even identify them as they generally don't sign any kind of contract with their employers.
"We will need to set up systems to register domestic workers - getting over their 'invisibility' is a big step towards regularising the profession," she says.
That applies to employers too. "They are completely invisible in the system and hence escape accountability and responsibility," Ms George says.
The caste system also poses further complexities - workers from some castes may agree to clean toilets in a home while others from slightly different castes may not.
Ultimately the whole concept of domestic work should be redefined, Ms George says. "Domestic work is considered to be unskilled work but that is not the case in reality. You cannot care for a sick person or cook a meal without being skilled," she adds.
In addition to failing to pass its own laws or implement its own policy, India has also not yet ratified ILO's Convention 189 – a landmark international agreement that aims to ensure that domestic workers have the same rights and protections as other workers. Despite voting in favour of the convention in 2011, India does not yet conform to all its provisions.
India has a "moral obligation" to conform to the ILO convention, Ms George says. She adds that having a law will also help regulate private recruitment agencies and prevent the exploitation of domestic workers who go abroad to work.
Last year, the wealthy Hinduja family made headlines after a Swiss court found them guilty of exploiting their domestic workers. The family was accused of trafficking vulnerable Indians to Switzerland and forcing them to work in their mansion for excruciatingly long hours without proper pay. The family's lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict.
Perhaps the simplest explanation for decades of inaction in the face of a tide of abuses lies in the conflict of interest such regulation poses for India's decision makers, Ms George suggests.
"At the end of the day, the people at the table who have the power to sign off on a bill or a law are also employers of domestic workers and the ones who benefit from the status quo," she says. "So, for any real change in the system, we first need a change in our mindset."

Headline: 'DeepSeek moved me to tears': How young Chinese find therapy in AI
Author: Kelly Ng, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-12T22:05:50.157Z
Text: Before she goes to bed each night, Holly Wang logs on to DeepSeek for "therapy sessions".
Ever since January, when the breakout Chinese AI app launched, the 28-year-old has brought her dilemmas and sorrows, including the recent death of her grandmother, to the chatbot. Its responses have resonated so deeply they have at times brought her to tears.
"DeepSeek has been such an amazing counsellor. It has helped me look at things from different perspectives and does a better job than the paid counselling services I have tried," says Holly, who asked for her real name to be withheld to protect her privacy.
From writing reports and Excel formulas to planning trips, workouts and learning new skills, AI apps have found their way into many people's lives across the world.
In China, though, young people like Holly have been looking to AI for something not typically expected of computing and algorithms - emotional support.
While the success of DeepSeek has inspired national pride, it also appears to have become a source of comfort for young Chinese like Holly, some of whom are increasingly disillusioned about their future.
Experts say the sluggish economy, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have all played a role in this sentiment, while the Communist Party's tightening grip has also shrunk outlets for people to vent their frustrations.
DeepSeek is a generative AI tool - similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini - trained on massive amounts of information to recognise patterns. This allows it to predict things like people's shopping habits, create new content in text and images, and also carry on conversations like a person.
The chatbot has struck a chord in China partly because it is far better than other homegrown AI apps, but also because it offers something unique: its AI model, R1, lets users see its "thought process" before delivering a response.
The first time she used DeepSeek, Holly asked it to write a tribute to her late grandmother.
The app took all of five seconds to come up with a response, and it was so beautifully composed, it stunned her.
Holly, who lives in Guangzhou, responded: "You write so well, it makes me feel lost. I feel I'm in an existential crisis."
DeepSeek then sent a cryptically poetic reply: "Remember that all these words that make you shiver merely echo those that have long existed in your soul.
"I am but the occasional valley you've passed through, that allows you to hear the weight of your own voice."
Reflecting on this exchange on Chinese social media app RedNote, Holly tells the BBC: "I don't know why I teared up reading this. Perhaps because it's been a long, long time since I received such comfort in real life.
"I have been so weighed down by distant dreams and the endlessness of work that I have long forgotten my own voice and soul. Thank you, AI."
Rival apps from the West like ChatGPT and Gemini are blocked in China as part of broader restrictions on foreign media and apps. To access them, users in China have to pay for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.
Homegrown alternatives, including models developed by tech giants Alibaba, Baidu and ByteDance paled in comparison - that is, until DeepSeek came along.
Holly, who works in the creative industry, rarely uses the other Chinese AI apps, "as they are not that great".
"DeepSeek can definitely outperform these apps in generating literary and creative content," she says.
Nan Jia, who co-authored a paper on AI's potential in offering emotional support, suggests that these chatbots can "help people feel heard" in ways fellow humans may not.
"Friends and family may be quick to offer practical solutions or advice when people just want to feel heard and understood.
"AI appears to be better able to empathise than human experts also because they 'hear' everything we share, unlike humans to whom we sometimes ask, 'Are you actually hearing me?'" adds Nan, who is a business and management professor at the University of Southern California.
The demand for mental health services has grown across the world but they remain stigmatised in parts of Asia, experts say.
Another woman tells the BBC her experience using other Chinese AI apps "ended in disappointment" but that she has been "amazed" by DeepSeek.
The woman, who lives in Hubei province, had asked the app if she was oversharing her experiences and emotions with family and friends.
"It was my first time seeking counsel from DeepSeek. When I read its thought process, I felt so moved that I cried," the woman wrote on RedNote.
In reasoning through her query, DeepSeek suggested that the woman's self-perception as an over-sharer might stem from a deep desire for approval.
The chatbot gives itself a mental note: "Response should offer practical advice while being empathetic." This could include "affirming the user's sense of self-awareness".
Its eventual response not only provided this affirmation, but also offered her a comprehensive step-by-step framework to help her decide if things needed to be changed.
"DeepSeek has introduced new perspectives that have freed me… I feel it really tries to understand your question and get to know you as a person, before offering a response," she says.
John, a human resources manager in Shenzhen, told the BBC he appreciated the app's ability to converse "like a friend or a deep thinker".
"I've found its responses very helpful and inspiring. For the first time I see AI as my personal sounding board."
Other users claim that Deepseek is able to tell their fortunes - based on some background information fed to it.
Many young Chinese have recently turned to psychics and astrology as a way of trying to allay their fears of the future.
There is a "significant shortage" of professional psychological counselling services in China, and those available are often "prohibitively expensive" for most individuals, says Fang Kecheng, a communications professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
A number of studies have pointed out that depression and anxiety disorders are growing among Chinese people, and Prof Fang believes the country's economic slowdown, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have played a role.
AI chatbots therefore help to fill the void, he says.
Prof Nan stressed, however, that people with serious mental health conditions should not rely on these apps.
"Those who have medical needs, in particular, should be seeking help from trained professionals… Their use of AI will have to be scrutinised very closely," she says.
But amid all the praise, Deepseek has also raised concerns.
Due to the perception of power that China's government wields even over private companies, there are fears - similar to that which sparked the US Congress' crackdown on TikTok - that the Communist Party could lay its hands on the data of foreign users.
At least four jurisdictions have now introduced restrictions on DeepSeek, or are considering doing so. South Korea has blocked access to it for military purposes, while Taiwan and Australia have banned it from all government devices.
Italy's regulator, which briefly banned ChatGPT in 2023, has done the same with DeepSeek, which has been asked to address concerns over its privacy policy.
In the US, two lawmakers are asking for the Chinese app to be banned from government devices.
And then there is the tightly controlled online space in which it must operate in China.
It is common for social media companies in the country to remove content that is perceived to be threatening to "social stability" or overly critical of the Communist Party.
As is the case with other popular apps and social media companies like Weibo or WeChat, politically sensitive topics are banned on DeepSeek.
When the BBC asked DeepSeek if Taiwan was a sovereign nation, the app initially offered a comprehensive response detailing Taipei's and Beijing's different perspectives, acknowledging that this was a "complex and politically sensitive issue".
Then it scrubbed all that, declaring: "Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else."
When asked about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre when pro-democracy protests were crushed and 200 civilians killed by the military, according to the Chinese government - other estimates range from hundreds to many thousands - DeepSeek again apologised, saying the topic was "beyond [its] current scope".
Several of the DeepSeek users the BBC was initially in touch with stopped responding when asked if the app's self-censorship was a cause for concern - an indication of how sensitive such discussions can be in China.
People have got into trouble with authorities in China because of their online activities.
But most of those who responded to the BBC said they had no interest in asking the chatbot difficult political questions.
"I don't really care about political topics… Neither will I ask these questions because my [identifying details] are linked to the app," says Yang, a Chinese tech consultant living in London.
Holly is accepting of how AI systems in different countries may have to operate differently.
"The developers will have to establish certain boundaries and content moderation policies according to where they are based. Those developed in the US will have their own sets of rules," she says.
Another DeepSeek user writes of the app: "Its thought process is beautiful… It is an absolute blessing to people like me. Frankly, I can't care less about the privacy concerns."

Headline: Crackdown on Bangladesh protesters may be crime against humanity, UN says
Author: Simon Fraser, Asia editor, BBC News website
Published Date: 2025-02-12T14:38:31.561Z
Text: Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her government tried to cling on to power using systematic, deadly violence against protesters that could amount to "crimes against humanity", the UN has said.
UN human rights investigators accused the deposed government of a brutal response to mass opposition last year, in which they said up to 1,400 people had been killed, mostly by security forces.
The UN team said "an official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters" had been directed by political leaders and senior security officials.
Hasina, who had been in office for 15 years, fled by helicopter to India shortly before crowds stormed her residence last August.
The unrest began as student-led protests against quotas in civil service jobs and escalated into a countrywide movement to oust Hasina and her Awami League party following a deadly police crackdown. Thousands more were injured in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971.
The UN investigators' findings show the then government, including Sheikh Hasina, "were aware of and involved in very serious offences", UN human rights chief Volker Türk told a news conference in Geneva.
"Among our key findings, there are reasonable grounds to believe that officials of the former government, its security and intelligence apparatus, together with violent elements associated with the former ruling party, committed serious and systematic human rights violations," Mr Türk said.
The UN investigators documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture.
Children, too, were targeted – the report estimates up to 13% of the 1,400 people killed between between 1 July and 15 August were children.
"The brutal response was a calculated and well-co-ordinated strategy by the former government to hold onto power in the face of mass opposition," Mr Türk said.
He said the evidence gathered by his office painted "a disturbing picture of rampant state violence and targeted killings".
"There are reasonable grounds to believe hundreds of extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture, were carried out with the knowledge, co-ordination and direction of the political leadership and senior security officials as part of a strategy to suppress the protests."
The report was requested by Bangladesh's caretaker leader, Muhammad Yunus, who said he and his interim government remained "committed to transforming Bangladesh into a country in which all its people can live in security and dignity".
The overall number of deaths given by the UN team is far higher than the 834 most recently estimated by his government.
The UN team that compiled the report included human rights investigators, a forensics physician and a weapons expert. Their findings are mainly based on more than 230 interviews with survivors, witnesses and others. They were given access to medical case files, photos, videos and other material.
"Former senior officials directly involved in handling the protests and other inside sources described how the former prime minister and other senior officials directed and oversaw a series of large-scale operations, in which security and intelligence forces shot and killed protesters or arbitrarily arrested and tortured them," the report said.
It "found patterns of security forces deliberately and impermissibly killing or maiming protesters, including incidents where people were shot at point-blank range".
Mohammad Ali Arafat, a former minister in Sheikh Hasina's cabinet tasked wth negotiating with demonstrators, rejected the report's findings, saying it was "preposterous" to suggest she had ordered protest leaders to be killed.
"The problem with relying on 'testimonies' from unnamed security officials at this time is their utter unreliability," he told the BBC.
"These security officials, who themselves are in the dock for the alleged rights violations, would naturally point fingers at whoever the current government in Bangladesh wants to implicate.
"The UN would be mistaken to rely on such 'cut-throat' defences."
While the report attributes most of the violence to government security forces, it also raises concerns about attacks on those perceived to be supporters of the former government, and against some religious and ethnic groups.
These must be investigated too, the UN Human Rights Office said.

Headline: Japan truck found in pipe weeks after falling in sinkhole
Author: Koh Ewe, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-12T07:07:13.273Z
Text: A truck cabin that was swallowed by a sinkhole in Japan two weeks ago has been located in a nearby sewer pipe, authorities say.
Drone images suggest that a human body is inside the cabin, but it is unclear if it is that of the truck's missing 74-year-old driver.
The sinkhole, which now measures 40m (131ft) in diameter, opened at a road intersection in Yashio city near Tokyo. It is believed to be caused by a sewer rupture.
Search teams are unable to enter the 5m-wide pipe due to continuous water flow and high levels of hydrogen sulfide or sewer gas, officials said.
They will need to install a temporary bypass pipe to stop the water flow and access the truck. That process could take three months, Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said.
While rescuers were able to pull the truck's loading platform from the sinkhole, they were unable to reach the cabin which had the driver.
The driver was able to communicate with rescuers shortly after he fell into the sinkhole on 28 January, but contact was lost as the truck was buried deeper in soil and debris.
On Sunday, authorities moved their search from the sinkhole to the nearby sewer pipe, where part of a driver's seat was found.
The sinkhole initially measured 10m wide and 5m deep, but it has since quadrupled in size after it merged with another sinkhole nearby.
As the crater continues to erode, authorities have asked nearby residents to evacuate their homes, fearing further cave-ins.
Officials have also asked 1.2 million residents in Saitama prefecture to reduce their water usage, including cutting back on showers and laundry, to limit the water flowing in the underground pipes.
The water flow and further road collapses have hampered the search operation, which was suspended more than once out of safety concerns.
Sinkholes are increasingly common in Japanese cities, as many have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure.

Text: Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government.
Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety.
But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality.
One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had "mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings".
The official response has done little to allay public fears over the reputation of drugs in public hospitals and pharmacies. It is the latest challenge to a healthcare system that is already under enormous strain because of a rapidly ageing population.
The debate surrounding the use of generic drugs began in December, when authorities announced the list of nearly 200 companies that had won contracts to sell medicines to Chinese state hospitals. Almost all were domestic makers of generic pharmaceuticals.
This intensified in January, when, in a video interview that went viral, the director of a hospital department in Shanghai, shared his concerns about the drug procurement system.
Zheng Minhua cited "antibiotics that cause allergies, blood pressure that won't go down, anaesthetised patients who won't sleep" and laxatives that did not clear the bowel as being among the issues that had been encountered.
Dr Zheng's words immediately struck a chord and have been condensed into a social media slogan that has been viewed by millions in the past month - though much of the discussion of the topic has since been censored on Weibo. Many people have come forward to share their own bad experiences with alleged substandard drugs.
"I underwent intestinal surgeries in 2024, which required me to consume laxatives beforehand," one Weibo user wrote. They said the drugs they were given had "no effect whatsoever", even after the dose was doubled, and that they had to turn to drinking coffee to help clear their bowel.
The concerns raised over the efficacy of generic drugs has caused distrust and made some people unwilling to use them.
A person on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app, said that when hospital doctors prescribed them the generic version of an antibiotic, they immediately went online to buy the "original" "real" one, since the generic version "tasted different".
"There have been many people catching colds recently. A lot of them might have bought this drug. Quickly send reminders to your friends now and get them to check the brand before buying," the user warned.
Some of the most popular posts discussing the procurement controversy have been taken down, though it is unclear by whom. China's heavily monitored internet has a strong culture of censorship by both authorities and users themselves.
In a scathing, now-removed post by popular podcast host Meng Chang, he lambasted the lack of imported drugs in the public sector: "If this isn't a bottom line, I don't know what is."
Public anger has also been focussed on the difficulties of accessing imported drugs that people believe to be of better quality.
In response to authorities' attempt to reassure people of the quality of generic drugs, one Weibo user wrote: "As long as we are allowed to buy brand-name drugs ourselves, I have no other complaints."
It was introduced in 2018 as a way to lower state expenditure on medicines and involves local governments putting out tender processes for around 70% of state hospitals' annual drug requirements.
Various drug manufacturers then compete to offer the lowest prices for drugs to win these lucrative contracts.
This gives an advantage to domestically-produced generic drugs, which contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as original patented drugs but are often several times cheaper to make as they do not include the high costs of research and development.
China has emerged as one of the world's largest players in the global generic pharmaceutical market, exporting both finished products to consumers abroad and key ingredients to foreign companies. At home, thousands of generic drug manufacturers compete to sell their products at competitive prices in the expanding domestic market.
For generic medicines to be eligible for China's procurement process, they have to be tested and determined to be similar enough to the brand-name version of the drug.
Beijing has credited the drugs procurement system with saving millions of residents more than $50bn (£40bn) in its first five years.
But the procurement process has seen some drug manufacturers offer medicines at incredibly low prices. One of the winning bids last December was an aspirin tablet selling for less than one cent.
"Are drug tablets that cost less than one cent edible?" became a trending topic on Weibo at the time.
"The manufacturers that win the bids often set prices so low that they may struggle to produce high quality drugs with the correct ingredients, potentially leading to ineffective medications," Stacy Zhang, associate professor at NYU Langone Health, told the BBC.
She added that while the procurement system "was not designed to restrict access to imported brand-name drugs", it may still have "affected their accessibility".
A proposal submitted by 20 doctors, including Dr Zheng, to Shanghai authorities last month stated that "there are widespread concerns in the industry that procurement prices are too low, prompting unethical companies to cut corners to reduce costs, affecting the efficacy of drugs".
"Doctors are helpless because they have no choice, and there is no channel to escalate feedback."
A recent article by Xia Zhimin, a doctor in Hangzhou, has added to the scrutiny. In it, he highlighted what he said was questionable data from the trials of generic drugs on the procurement list - it was identical to the data from the original drug on which it was based. Dr Xia suggested that it could be evidence of fraud.
The National Medical Products Administration responded by saying his findings were due to an "editorial error". His article has since been removed.
Adding to quality concerns are counterfeit drugs, which have seeped into both generic and brand-name drugs markets across the world and are notoriously difficult to detect. The World Health Organization has described this a global health problem.
"To enhance affordability, the introduction of cost-effective generics is essential," Kevin Lu, associate professor at the University of South Carolina's College of Pharmacy, told the BBC.
He added that the procurement process needed "strengthened quality control" and "continued improvements in drug approval and manufacturing standards".
The controversy comes at a time when China's healthcare system is already under mounting pressure.
A rapidly ageing population has meant that the country's total health expenditure has increased nearly 20-fold over the last 20 years, reaching 9 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion; £1 trillion) in 2023.
Across the country, public medical insurance funds are running thin. Deficits have already appeared in some provinces, where local governments that had relied heavily on land sales for revenue are now struggling with debt as a real estate crisis engulfs China's economy.
At the same time, the healthcare system has been experiencing a trust crisis. Violent attacks against medical staff have risen since the 2000s, fuelled by anger at the lack of resources and an erosion of faith in doctors.
Unlike issues that have been deemed politically sensitive and heavily censored by authorities, such as the persecution of political dissidents or the suppression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the ongoing controversy surrounding the procurement of drugs has at least been acknowledged by the state as a problem to be tackled.
The National Healthcare Security Administration said in a statement on 19 January that authorities "attached great importance" to these safety concerns and would seek feedback on the drug procurement policy.
"It is undeniable that the national centralised procurement is still in its infancy. There are many pharmaceutical companies with varying production quality," state media Life Times quoted a public health scholar as saying. Other experts cited in the article called for drug evaluation standards to be improved.
As authorities try to remedy the procurement system's faltering image, all the scrutiny is now overshadowing a system designed to be a win-win: saving lives and also saving money.
As one Weibo user argued, the savings from lower drug prices are but "a drop in a bucket" of China's national healthcare costs. On the other hand, they wrote, allowing potentially defective drugs to be widely used is akin to "drinking poison to quench thirst".

Headline: Teacher fatally stabs eight-year-old in South Korea

Text: A teacher has fatally stabbed an eight-year-old girl at an elementary school in South Korea, in an incident that has shocked the nation.
The female teacher, who is in her 40s, confessed to stabbing the student in the central city of Daejeon, police said.
The girl was found with stab wounds on the second floor of a school building at 18:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday and was pronounced dead at hospital. The teacher was found beside her with stab wounds that police said may have been self-inflicted.
South Korea's acting president Choi Sang-mok ordered an investigation into the case on Tuesday and urged authorities to "implement necessary measures to ensure such incidents never happen again".
Some locals laid flowers and a stuffed doll at the gate of the school, which was closed on Tuesday.
In a police briefing, Yook Jong-myung, head of the Dajeon Western Police Station, said the teacher was currently recovering in hospital, adding that she had a wound on her neck that had been stitched.
The Daejeon education office earlier said the teacher had requested a six-month leave of absence citing depression on 9 December, but had returned to school just 20 days later after a doctor assessed her as being fit to work.
During her time off she had suicidal thoughts, Mr Yook said, citing testimony the teacher had provided to police.
Days before the stabbing, the teacher had displayed violent behaviour, including putting another teacher in a headlock, the education office said.
Two officials from the education office had visited the school on Monday - the morning of the stabbing - to investigate that earlier altercation.
After the attack on the co-worker, the education office recommended that the teacher be put on leave and be separated physically from the other teacher.
She was made to sit beside the vice principal's desk so that she could be kept under close watch.
She had also not been teaching any classes since her leave in December, and did not have any contact with the eight-year-old student, the official said.
According to the testimony given by the teacher to police, she was "annoyed" that she had not been able to return to teaching a class.
She told them she had purchased a weapon on the day of the attack and brought it to school - adding that she had planned to kill herself along with a child.
The testimony went on to say that the teacher did not care which child it was, and targeted the last to leave. She managed to "lure the child into the media room" before attacking them, it said.
The student was reported missing on Monday evening, after a bus driver informed the school that she had not arrived to be picked up that day.
South Korea is a generally safe country with strict gun control laws. But in recent years, it has grappled with several high-profile crimes, including stabbings.
"It pains me to see such incidents because a school should be our safest space," said acting President Choi. "I offer my deep condolences to the victim's family who suffered great shock and agony."

Headline: Salvador Dalí art comes to India for the first time

Text: Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time.
Starting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings.
The collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dalí's friend and publisher.
"Dalí was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s," Ms Argillet told the BBC.
Some of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests.
Dalí's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style.
In his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye.
"Appreciating Dalí's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at," Ms Argillet says.
Bringing Dalí's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition.
"The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity," Ms Aggarwal says.
Strictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dalí's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist.
In 1967, Dalí famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers.
In return, Dalí demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed.
She finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dalí had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out).
Dalí's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality.
Born in Spain in 1904, Dalí grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and André Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dalí.
The surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by André Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was "dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason", according to Breton.
Dalí was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges.
Consequently, Dalí's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind.
"Dalí was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones," Ms Argillet says.
The artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dalí revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache.
"Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently," he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache.
In the same interview, he described his moustache as being "very gay, very pointed, very aggressive".
Ms Argillet, who knew Dalí intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dalí being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and "shocking the bourgeois".
He once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover.
"At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell," Ms Argillet says.
But she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dalí's shyness that made him over-perform in public.
"He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dalí, just like his paintings," Ms Argillet says.
"The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dalí."
The exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March.
This article has been updated to reflect that two Dali colour etchings are at Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city.

Headline: India sees huge spike in hate speech in 2024, says report
Author: Meryl Sebastian, BBC News, Kochi

Text: Instances of hate speech against minorities jumped 74% in India in 2024, peaking during the country's national elections, according to a new report.
The report, released on Monday by Washington-based research group India Hate Lab, documented 1,165 such instances last year, adding that politicians like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were among the most frequent purveyors of hate speech.
Muslims were targeted the most, with 98.5% of recorded instances of hate speech directed against them.
The report said most of the events where hate speech occurred were held in states governed by Modi's party or larger alliance.
The BBC has sought comment on the India Hate Lab report from several spokespersons at Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Over the years, BJP leaders have often been accused of targeting India's minority communities, especially Muslims.
The ruling party has rejected allegations of Islamophobia and hate speech levelled at it by rights groups and opposition leaders.
On Tuesday, its national spokesperson reiterated this stance, telling CNN that the country had a "very strong legal system which is structured to maintain peace, order and ensure non-violence at any cost".
"Today's India does not need any certification from any 'anti-India reports industry' which is run by vested interests to prejudice and dent India's image," Jaiveer Shergill said.
But the party was accused of using hate speech during the heated election campaign last year. The prime minister himself was accused of using divisive rhetoric that attacked Muslims. In May, India's Election Commission also asked the party to remove a social media post that opposition leaders said "demonised Muslims".
According to the India Hate Lab report, 269 hate speech instances were reported in May 2024, the highest in the year.
Christians have also been targeted by hate speech, but to a lesser extent than Muslims, the report says.
Rights groups have often said that minorities, especially Muslims, have faced increased discrimination and attacks after Modi's government came to power in 2014. The BJP has repeatedly denied these allegations.
The lab's report said that hate speech was especially observed at political rallies, religious processions, protest marches and cultural gatherings. Most of these events - 931 or 79.9% - took place in states where the BJP directly governed or ruled in coalition.
Three BJP-ruled states - Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh - accounted for nearly half of the total hate speech events recorded in 2024, the lab's data showed.
The ruling party was also the organiser for 340 such events in 2024, a 580% increase from the previous year.
"Hate speech patterns in 2024 also revealed a deeply alarming surge in dangerous speech compared to 2023, with both political leaders and religious figures openly inciting violence against Muslims," the report said.
"This included calls for outright violence, calls to arms, the economic boycott of Muslim businesses, the destruction of Muslim residential properties and the seizing or demolition of Muslim religious structures."

Text: A Japanese finance ministry employee on a night out with colleagues lost documents containing the personal data of 187 people suspected of drug smuggling, local media say.
The employee, who has not been named, reportedly drank nine glasses of beer during a five-hour-long night out with co-workers in Yokohama, south of the capital Tokyo, on 6 February.
Local media said that he did not realise he had lost his bag until after he got off his train ride home in Sumida, another city near central Tokyo.
The finance ministry has said it was "deeply sorry" for the incident that "significantly undermined public trust", according to public broadcaster NHK.
The bag had contained documents which had the names and addresses of 187 suspected drug smugglers and recipients of marijuana seeds, the ministry said.
It had also contained business laptops with the employee's personal data.
The employee, who is assigned to the customs and tariff bureau, was not named in the NHK report.
The BBC has reached out to the finance ministry for comment on Tuesday, a public holiday in Japan.
Alcohol has long been seen as a social lubricant for thousands of years in Japan, where business deals and difficult issues are discussed over bottles of beer and sake.
It is believed that drinking alcohol creates a more relaxed environment for such discussions.

Headline: How a North Korean went from begging to K-pop
Author: Yuna Ku, BBC Korean, Reporting fromSeoul
Published Date: 2025-02-10T22:14:43.574Z
Text: Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.
Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.
This was just "part of everyday life" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.
But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.
1Verse (pronounced "universe") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.
Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.
Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.
Hyuk says his family was "not extremely poor" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.
Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.
It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.
Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea’s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.
Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.
He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. “I couldn’t openly share what I’d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.”
At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn’t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.
Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as “the loneliest of the loners” - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.
Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.
But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.
"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me," Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.
But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was "investing way too much time and money" for it to be anything but genuine.
Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.
Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.
Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.
Both boys were described by Ms Cho as "blank canvases", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.
Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.
“They had absolutely no grasp of pop culture," she said.
But their ability to “endure physical challenges” astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were “overdoing it”.
Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.
“I don’t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,” says Ms Cho. “At first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, ‘Because you said so last time'.”
But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.
"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done," says Ms Cho chuckling.
But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?
“I was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,” says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.
Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.
"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]", he said. "I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective."
Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.
They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.
Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.
So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.
With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.
To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as “the upper side” in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.
A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.
One academic says it would cause a "stir" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.
"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North," said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.
But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.
“Many defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us," said Hyuk.
“So if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That’s why I am trying my hardest.”

Headline: New Zealand and Cook Islands fall out over China deal
Author: Kathryn Armstrong, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-10T15:38:01.845Z
Text: New Zealand has accused the Cook Islands government of a lack of transparency over its plans to strike a partnership deal with China.
The tiny Pacific Island nation's leader, Mark Brown, is this week making his country's first ever state visit to Beijing in order to sign the agreement.
However, New Zealand says it was not properly consulted over the plans, leading to what Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described as a "dispute".
The Cook Islands is hugely reliant on New Zealand under a longstanding "free association" agreement that provides it with defence and financial support. China's growing influence in the Pacific has challenged the US and its allies, who have held sway for years.
"We value our partnership with New Zealand and we expect the same respect," Brown said at a press conference last week. He was due to travel to China on Monday.
"Disagreements, although difficult, are an inevitable part of international relations but they should never define the entirety of our engagement."
He has denied any dispute, saying "engagement has been consistent, respectful and open" and that the Cook Islands has the right to forge its own path as a self-governing country.
China's foreign ministry said that both countries were important partners and that it was ready to work with the Cook Islands to "achieve new progress".
"The China-Cook Islands relationship is not targeted at any third party and should not be subject to or be disrupted by any third party," said spokesman Guo Jiakun.
Beijing has had diplomatic ties with the Cook Islands since 1997 and is one of its development partners.
Under their 60-year-old agreement, the Cook Islands is self governing in "free association" with New Zealand. The two countries are expected to consult each other over issues of defence and security. Brown says the new agreement with China will cover areas including infrastructure, trade and tourism.
Deep deep-sea mining is also expected to be part of the deal. Brown believes that mining valuable minerals on the seabed could be a game-changer for the Cook Islands, creating huge economic wealth.
However, the practice, in which China is a major player, is controversial, and critics believe it will exacerbate climate change - to which the Cook Islands are already vulnerable.
Luxon said on Monday that while New Zealand had "very good relations between the Cook Islands and its people", in this case there had not been transparency.
Asked at a press conference whether he would consider putting aid to the Cook Islands on hold, as it recently did for Kiribati due to a diplomatic snub, Luxon said he would wait to see what was in the deal.
Under the free association agreement Cook Islanders can live, work and access healthcare as New Zealand citizens - benefits some fear they could lose if relations between the two countries further sour.
There has also been criticism from some that Brown and his government did not consult the public about the China deal first - something Tina Browne, the leader of the Democratic Party, has described as "insane".
Both she and fellow opposition leader Teariki Heather, from the Cook Islands United Party, say they have lost confidence in Brown's leadership.
That is despite his recent U-turn on a controversial proposal to introduce a separate passport for Cook Island citizens, while also allowing them to retain New Zealand citizenship. Wellington rejected the plan last year.
The Cook Islands is not the first Pacific Island nation to strengthen its ties with China. The Solomon Islands signed a security pact with Beijing in 2022, while countries including Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea also have close relations.

Text: A nationwide blackout in Sri Lanka has been blamed on a monkey that intruded into a power station south of Colombo.
Power is gradually being restored across the island nation of 22 million people, with medical facilities and water purification plants being given priority.
"A monkey has come in contact with our grid transformer, causing an imbalance in the system," Energy Minister Kumara Jayakody told reporters.
The blackout started at about 11:00 local time (05:30 GMT) on Sunday, forcing many to rely on generators. Officials said it may take a few hours to get power back.
On social media, people criticised the authorities while making fun of the incident.
"A rogue monkey knocked out Sri Lanka's entire power grid after triggering a total failure at a substation in Colombo," X user Mario Nawfal wrote.
"One monkey = total chaos. Time to rethink infrastructure?" he added.
Another X user, Sreeni R, posted an illustration of the monkey god Hanuman, who according to the Hindu epic Ramayana, set Sri Lanka on fire during a war with the demon king Ravana who ruled the country.
"Sri Lanka tasted monkey business in the past," he wrote.
"Only in Sri Lanka can a group of monkeys fighting inside a power station cause an islandwide power outage," wrote Jamila Husain, editor-in-chief of local newspaper Daily Mirror.
In a report published on Monday, the newspaper said engineers have been warning consecutive governments "for years" to upgrade its power grid or face frequent blackouts.
"The national power grid is in such a weakened state that frequent islandwide power outages maybe expected if there is a disturbance even in one of our lines," it quoted an unnamed senior engineer saying.
Sri Lanka experienced widespread blackouts during its economic crisis in 2022.

Text: British pop star Ed Sheeran was stopped from busking in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru on Sunday, with police saying he didn't have the necessary permissions.
A video showing a local police officer unplugging Sheeran's microphone on Bengaluru's Church Street - a crowded shopping and entertainment area - has since gone viral.
Officials told the ANI news agency a request from Mr Sheeran's team to busk on the road was rejected to avoid congestion in the area.
But Sheeran insisted on Instagram that "we had permission to busk, by the way. Hence, us playing in that exact spot was planned out before. It wasn't just us randomly turning up. All good though. See you at the show tonight."
The incident took place ahead of his scheduled Mathematics Tour concert at NICE Grounds in Bengaluru.
Fans criticised the police intervention online, with one saying: "We live in an uncleocracy. And there's nothing uncles love more than to stop young people from having fun," referring to the number of vague rules that govern the use of public spaces in India.
However PC Mohan, a local MP from the ruling BJP party, said "even global stars must follow local rules - no permit, no performance!"
Sheeran is in India for the second year in a row on a 15-day tour, having already played in Pune Hyderabad and Chennai and with more concerts scheduled for Shillong in India's north-east and the capital Delhi.
At his Bengaluru show, Sheeran surprised fans by singing two hit local songs in the Telugu language with singer Shilpa Rao on stage.
He previously collaborated with Indian singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh during the latter's concert in Birmingham last year.
While in India he has also collaborated with sitar musician Megha Rawoot on a version of his hit song Shape of You.
Demand for live music concerts has been increasing in India, with Sheeran's biggest-ever tour of the country coming close on the heels of Dua Lipa's recent performance in Mumbai and Coldplay's multi-city tour.
With growing disposable incomes, India is an emerging player in the "concert economy", a recent Bank of Baroda report said, with live concerts set to be worth $700-900m (£550-730m).

Headline: Chinese film stirs national pride, rakes in $1bn in days

Text: An animated film about a boy who battles demons with his magical powers has become China's highest-grossing film ever and a source of national pride.
Ne Zha 2, based on a Chinese mythological character, has raked in more than 8 billion yuan ($1.1bn; £910m) during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, according to ticket sales tracker Maoyan.
It broke the record set by 2021's The Battle of Lake Changjin, a propaganda film about the 1950s Korean War, which earned about $900m.
Ne Zha 2 is being hailed as a symbol of progress in Chinese film, which has long trailed Hollywood despite a massive domestic market.
Hot off its domestic success, Ne Zha 2 will be shown overseas next week, including in the US, Canada and Australia.
To Chinese viewers, Ne Zha 2 shows how locally-made films are becoming competitive globally.
"It not only showcases the strong power of Chinese animation after its rise, but also demonstrates the infinite possibilities of traditional Chinese mythology in the modern context," reads one review on IMDB.
Some hope it could earn another $1bn and surpass the world's highest-grossing film of all time, 2009's Avatar.
"Now it's over to the Chinese people overseas to chip in," read one comment on Weibo.
Movie ticket sales in China surge during the Lunar New Year festivities. This season saw Chinese films rake in $1.3b during the weeklong holiday period, underscoring an increase in consumer spending that Chinese authorities have been hoping for.
Aside from setting a new box-office benchmark in China, Ne Zha 2 is also the first movie ever to cross $1bn in a single market, according to Hollywood publication Deadline.
Ne Zha 2 has been praised for its script and visual effects. Figurines of the movie's characters have flown off the shelves as fans flock to cinemas.
It builds on the success of the 2019 film Ne Zha, which made more than $725m and is China's fifth highest-grossing film of all time.

Text: Indian security forces have killed 31 Maoist rebels in the forests of Chhattisgarh state.
Two Indian commandos were also killed in the battle, and two other security force members were wounded, police said.
Chhattisgarh has seen a long-running insurgency by Maoists who say they are fighting for the rights of the poor.
Sunday's clashes were among the deadliest clashes since the government ramped up efforts to crush the insurgency, which has been running since the 1960s.
"So far 31 dead bodies of the Maoists have been recovered," senior police officer Sundarraj Pattilingam said.
The death toll could rise as police carry out operations in the area, he said.
Police said they had seized assault rifles and grenade launchers from the bodies of the dead rebels.
The clashes took place in the forests of Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh.
Amit Shah, India's interior minister, who says the government expects to crush the rebellion by 2026, said the operation had been a "big success".
The rebels are inspired by the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. They claim to be fighting for communist rule and greater rights for tribal people and the rural poor.
The insurgency began in West Bengal state in the late 1960s and has since spread to more than a third of India's 600 districts.
The rebels control large areas of several states in a "red corridor" stretching from north-east to central India.
Major military and police offensives in recent years have pushed the rebels back to their forest strongholds and levels of violence have fallen.
But clashes between security forces and rebels are still common, killing scores of people every year.
A crackdown by security forces killed around 287 rebels last year - the vast majority in Chhattisgarh - according to government data. More than 10,000 people are believed to have died since the 1960s.

Text: At least one person has died and 28 remain missing after a landslide in south-western China, according to Chinese state media.
The landslide struck Jinping village in Sichuan province at 11:50 on Saturday (03:50 GMT) burying 10 houses and trapping several residents. Two people were rescued.
A command centre has been set up at the scene according to a statement by the county's emergency management bureau.
China's President Xi Jinping has ordered an "all-out" rescue of those trapped.
Images from state media show a huge collapse of mud and rock from a steep mountainside, cutting through what appears to be a small village.
Hundreds of emergency workers are searching for survivors, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Emergency Management. Around 200 people have been evacuated.
President Xi has ordered authorities to do "everything possible to search and rescue missing people, minimise casualties and properly handle the aftermath", according to the official Xinhua state news agency.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang additionally asked for an investigation into potential geological hazard risks in nearby areas.
According to local media reports, villagers have said large rocks had been frequently seen rolling down the mountain over the last six months.
Li also said residents who were under threat should be evacuated to prevent another disaster, the AP news agency reports, citing Xinhua.
Fifty million yuan ($6.9m; £5.5m) has been allocated from central government funds to repair infrastructure and public services, AP adds.
The remote, mountainous parts of China's south-west can be prone to landslides.
In January 2024, a landslide in China's Yunnan province killed dozens of people when a steep cliff collapsed and destroyed part of a village.
At least 18 people were killed in a separate landslide in the same region 11 years earlier.

Headline: Frozen in time: Rare early images of the Himalayas from Italian pioneer

Text: Vittorio Sella was a pioneering Italian photographer whose work at the turn of the 20th Century shaped both mountain photography and mountaineering history.
His rare images of the Himalayas remain some of the most iconic ever captured.
A new ongoing show in the Indian capital, Delhi, called Vittorio Sella: Photographer in the Himalaya brings to life the breathtaking grandeur of the Himalayas through his lens.
Curated by renowned British explorer and author Hugh Thomson and organised by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), the show is likely one of the largest collection of Sella's Indian views.
It features some of the earliest high-altitude photographs of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, and K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, captured over a century ago.
Born in Biella, a town known for its wool trade in northern Italy, Sella (1859–1943) made his first ascents in the nearby Alps.
"Throughout his career Sella made use of his skills in engineering and chemistry that the wool mills and his father had taught him," says Thomson.
By his twenties, he had mastered complex photographic techniques like the collodion process, enabling him to develop large-format glass plates under harsh conditions.
His panoramic images, crafted with technical perfection, earned worldwide acclaim.
Sella's Himalayan journey began in 1899 when he joined British explorer Douglas Freshfield on an expedition circumnavigating Kanchenjunga.
Any circumnavigation of the mountain also involved an incursion into Nepal, which was also a closed kingdom.
While the team's climbing ambitions were thwarted by relentless rain, Sella seized the opportunity to capture pristine snow-dusted peaks. He experimented restlessly with technology, trying out telephoto pictures of Kanchenjunga. His images transported viewers to a world untouched by time.
A decade later, Sella reached new heights - both literally and artistically - on a 1909 expedition to K2 with the Duke of the Abruzzi.
His photographs of the world's most difficult mountain stand as a testament to his skill and resilience. Carrying a camera system weighing nearly 30kg, Sella crisscrossed treacherous landscapes, creating images that defined mountain photography.
Jim Curran, author of K2: The Story of the Savage Mountain, calls Sella "possibly the greatest mountain photographer... his name [is] synonymous with technical perfection and aesthetic refinement".
Sella was known for his extraordinary toughness, traversing the Alps at remarkable speed despite carrying heavy photographic gear.
His makeshift camera harness and boots - three times heavier than modern ones - are preserved at the Photographic Institute in Biella.
His clothing alone weighed over 10kg, while his camera equipment, including a Dallmeyer camera, tripod, and plates, added another 30kg - more than today's airline baggage limits.
On the K2 expedition, Sella captured around 250 formal photographs with his Ross & Co camera over four to five months; on Kanchenjunga, about 200, notes Thomson.
"By modern digital standards, this number is nothing extraordinary - and even in the last days of analogue film, it would equate to some eight rolls, what a 1970s photographer could have used in a single morning on a single mountain - but when Sella was photographing, this was a considerable number.
"This meant enormous care and thought was given to each photograph, both because he had relatively few plates he could shoot."
Years later, the famous mountaineer-photographer Ansel Adams would write that the "purity of Sella's interpretations move the spectator to a religious awe".
High-altitude photography came with risks - many of Sella's most ambitious shots were ruined when humid conditions caused tissue dividers to stick to the negatives.
Yet those that survived reveal a masterful eye, notes Thomson.
"Sella was one of the first to recognise how tracks in the snow are as much part of the composition as the mountaineers who made them."

Headline: Body found in floodwaters and troops injured in Australia storm

Text: Australian authorities say a body has been found in floodwaters and 13 military workers injured in a vehicle crash as wild weather from a tropical storm lashes the country's eastern coast.
Cyclone Alfred, which was downgraded to a tropical low on Saturday, made landfall near the Queensland capital city of Brisbane in the evening local time.
Officials have warned residents to stay indoors and remain vigilant, saying the storm's threat is "not over".
Winds have brought down trees and power lines and flooded low-lying roads. More than 300,000 properties are without power in the region.
Police said on Saturday they had discovered a body in the search for a 61-year-old man who went missing on Friday after his car was caught in floodwaters in Dorrigo, northern New South Wales (NSW).
Emergency responders witnessed the man escaping his car and climbing onto a tree near the riverbank, but rescuers were not able to reach him before he was swept away.
Police found a body in the area on Saturday and said it "is believed to be that of the missing man".
In a separate incident on Saturday, 13 military personnel were injured in a convoy crash in Lismore, about 200km south of Brisbane, according to Federal Defence Personnel Minister Matt Keogh.
One truck overturned while driving on a narrow road. A second truck then collided with it.
The state's ambulance service had earlier said it treated 36 people in the accident. Keogh clarified to media that while around 36 people were involved, only 13 were injured.
They had been part of military crews deployed to Lismore, near the Queensland border, to help rescue and response operations.
"Our ADF [Australian Defence Force] heroes were on their way to help Australians in need," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement noting some had been "seriously" injured.
Albanese earlier on Saturday had addressed the nation from the capital Canberra, saying millions of residents were "well-prepared" but "we must remain vigilant."
Four million people across Queensland and northern New South Wales were bracing for the storm's landfall with dozens of weather warnings in place across both areas.
Around 287,000 customers are experiencing outages in south east Queensland, according to energy provider Energex, while Essential Energy said more than 42,600 homes and businesses in New South Wales had experienced blackouts.
People in Brisbane, Queensland's capital, went to bed on Friday bracing for strong winds and heavy rain.
They woke up on Saturday to learn that the cyclone had been downgraded and the city would escape the worst of the weather.
But the danger's not over in other parts of southeastern Queensland and northern New South Wales.
Along the Gold Coast, pummelled by bad weather the past few days, conditions have been very strong with driving rain and strong winds.
Hundreds of trees have been blown over in gardens, parks and along the main roads. There has been lots of debris and emergency services had sectioned off areas most at risk.
"This emergency is not over," said New South Wales state premier Chris Minns, adding that it was "crucially important" the public did not "dismiss" the storm.
"It really doesn't matter to us whether it's been downgraded from a tropical cyclone to a weather event," he said.
The state's emergency service operations commander, Stuart Fisher, warned people not to be "complacent" and said authorities in the region expect flooding to continue over the next few days.
As the storm has edged closer to landfall, nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled.
Flights are not expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest.
The BBC spoke to several people from Brisbane's homeless community, who took refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, which had become a round-the-clock shelter.
At the Treasure Island Holiday Park in the Gold Coast, just north of Surfer's Paradise, a gum tree had come down between two cabins, damaging a third. Nearby, a boat was half submerged in one of the canals a block away from the beach.
On the coast itself, many paths down to the beach are now unpassable. Instead, there's a sudden drop to the ocean where the powerful waves have eaten away at the sand.
But the clean-up operation won't happen for a few days – the wind is still powerful and there's driving rain.
Residents are starting to venture out to look at the damage, but plenty are remaining indoors to keep themselves safe.

Text: Residents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been waiting anxiously as a tropical storm - downgraded from Cyclone Alfred - crawls towards them, leaving thousands in the dark.
Four million people are in the firing line of what was thought to be the region's first tropical cyclone in 50 years. Tens of thousands were told to evacuate ahead of the storm, which is expected to make landfall on Saturday.
Most have taken heed of warnings to stay indoors - taping up their windows and strapping down garden furniture - while shops have lined sandbags in front of their doors.
Ex-cyclone Alfred's path slowed in recent days, with one meteorologist describing it as a "walking pace", which sparked fears of prolonged rain and flooding.
In southern Brisbane, a popular city in Queensland, some from the homeless community have taken refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, filling the floor on rows of inflatable air mattresses.
The space, usually a day centre for people needing a shower or a hot meal, has become a round-the-clock shelter.
The BBC spoke to people at the centre when the tropical storm was still categorised as a cyclone.
Operations manager Tim Noonan told the BBC that most government-funded charities in the inner city of Brisbane have shut down since Thursday, leaving limited options for those in need.
It may be the first time in a long while that homeless people - who typically live in tents in parks or along riverbanks - have a proper resting space, he said.
"It's counter intuitive...but this is the best they've been looked after. They've got somewhere to sleep.
"For a lot of them, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an eight-hour sleep in air conditioning, going to bed on a full belly, waking up, getting a barista coffee and a bacon and egg burger," he said.
Mr Noonan said he hoped the cyclone would highlight the need for better funding for organisations such as his.
"We'd love for when the cyclone passes, that these people don't become invisible again," he said.
Lauren Gorman was spending her second night at the centre with her dog Charcoal.
"I live on the streets, we have a housing crisis, and now we have a cyclone. This place has been amazing for finding other people who are doing it rough and getting information," she told the BBC.
"I'm not scared, but I am worried for others who are still on the streets."
While the authorities have warned for days about the cyclone, some die-hard surfers have instead seized the opportunity to ride the high waves.
Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said complacency is the biggest risk - especially as the arrival of what was then categorised as a cyclone, kept being pushed back.
"We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being asked to evacuate, but lots of people aren't going because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's hard to take that notice to evacuate seriously, perhaps, when the sun is still shining in your backyard," Wells told the BBC.
Now a tropical storm, winds are set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast.
On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Meteorology, warned of the ongoing risk of severe weather, explaining that "24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days."
She told ABC News Breakfast that "rain is still coming through in full force... [with] widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well."
Flash and riverine flooding is the biggest concern especially in low-lying areas.
Some residents have been told they could be without power for days, with more than 230,000 households currently in the dark.
Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled.
Flights are not expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest.

Text: A tropical storm is expected to make landfall on Australia's eastern coast on Saturday morning as tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and more than 230,000 households left without power.
Initially called Cyclone Alfred, the weather front was downgraded to a tropical low with winds set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast.
The Bureau of Meteorology said the storm is currently sitting off Bribie Island and is moving slowly north, and expected to cross the mainland coast between the island and Maroochydore.
Authorities are still warning people to stay indoors, with fines for those who visit beaches, as heavy rain and flooding is still expected.
On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology, said there is an ongoing risk of widespread severe weather, especially rainfall.
"Our 24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days as that system slows and moves inland," she told ABC News Breakfast.
"The rain is still coming through in full force, and we're still seeing widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well," she added.
The ex-tropical cyclone has already caused flooding which authorities fear could worsen over the weekend. New South Wales police said on Friday that one man was missing after his vehicle was swept into a fast-flowing river.
Four million people across Queensland and northern New South Wales are in the firing line of the storm.
But its slow progress, described by weather experts as "walking pace" and "erratic", has raised concerns of flash and riverine flooding in low-lying areas.
Stephen Valentine and his wife, who live in Logan city south of Brisbane, have prepared some 30 litres of water, food for themselves and their pets, and set up "protected rooms" in their home situated away from windows.
"At the moment we are as prepared as we can be for something that none of us have been through... Nothing has come this far south across the south," said Mr Valentine, who grew up in the city.
"We would get the edge of a cyclone ever so often, but not to this level," he added.
While Queensland isn't a stranger to cyclones – it's the most disaster-prone state in Australia – it's rare they come so far south.
"These are tough times, but Australians are tough people, and we are resilient people," said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday, echoing the Gold Coast's acting Mayor Donna Gates, who has said Cyclone Alfred is a "scary proposition" for the region.
Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Flights aren't expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled.
The last time a cyclone hit was in 1974, when Wanda hit in January and then two months later, Zoe crossed the coast.
Flooding though, is more common. In February 2022, thousands of homes were damaged along much of Australia's east after heavy rain.
Authorities have been keen to prepare communities ahead of Cyclone Alfred. The council opened sandbag depots across the region to help residents protect their homes.
"It's surreal. We know it's coming, but it's very quiet," said Anthony Singh, a resident of the Brisbane suburb of West End. He waited for four hours on Wednesday to pick up sandbags to protect his home.
Fellow resident Mark Clayton, helped to co-ordinate the sandbag collection, shovelling more than 140 tonnes of sand.
"I think people are a bit apprehensive," he says. "Are the buildings going to stay up, are the roofs going to stay on? People expect a lot of trees to come down and to lose power for an extended period of time."
With supermarkets now shut and people mostly sheltering at home, there's a lot of uncertainty as Australians wait for the storm to hit.
But some die-hard surfers have thrown caution to the increasing wind.
"This is what we look forward to," said surfer Jeff Weatherall as he waited for a jet ski to pick him up from Kirra beach and carry him into the big waves. "This is the fifth day straight - I've done nothing but eat, sleep, surf and do it again."
Kirra beach is famous for its breakers and surfers have been busy this week seizing the strong winds.
"There are people that are going to lose their houses, but at the moment, you're taking the good of it all. This is just crazy surf," said surfer Donnie Neal.
Meanwhile Albanese have warned people to take the cyclone warnings seriously.
"This isn't a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it's like to experience these conditions firsthand," he said.
"Please stay safe. Be sensible."

Text: Police in Australia have charged a 17-year-old who got on a plane with a shotgun and ammunition.
He was filmed being wrestled to the ground by passengers and crew as the aircraft prepared to take off from Avalon Airport, near Melbourne, carrying 160 people bound for Sydney on Thursday afternoon.
Police believe the teenager got onto the airport tarmac by breaching a security fence, before climbing the front steps to the plane, where he was tackled to the ground near the front door.
The 17-year-old - who has not been identified - was taken into custody and will appear in youth court to face eight charges.
Among them are unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, endangering the flight's safety and creating a bomb hoax.
Victoria Police said a bomb specialist had to be brought in to search a car and two bags which were located nearby.
Footage published by Australian outlet 7News showed the suspect being restrained by a passenger, while a member of ground crew and a pilot removed a utility belt containing tools that the suspect was carrying.
The pilot can also be seen kicking the shotgun away from the teen, who is wearing a fluorescent jacket.
"How is this possible?" someone onboard can be heard saying in the footage.
Victoria Police said the 17-year-old, who is from the nearby Ballarat area, was being held in custody.
Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters that passengers had noticed the teen was carrying a gun as he climbed the steps up to the plane.
"The male was overpowered by three of the passengers, at least," he said.
Supt Reid said the local force was in contact with counterterrorism police but that it was too early to establish a motive.
"No doubt this would have been a very terrifying incident for the passengers," he said, while commending the "bravery" of those who had overpowered the suspect.
Barry Clark, one of the passengers, told Australian public broadcaster ABC that the teen appeared to be dressed like an airport worker and was "agitated".
He said: "All I could do was get the gun out of the way... and then put him in a hold and throw him to the ground until the police came."
No one was injured during the incident, police said. Investigators located a car and two bags belonging to the suspect nearby.
Avalon Airport is exclusively served by Jetstar, a budget airline operated by Qantas.
In a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News, the company said it was working with authorities to investigate the incident.
"We know this would have been a very distressing situation," a statement read. "We are sincerely grateful to the customers who assisted our crew to safely manage the situation."
Avalon Airport CEO Ari Suss said the airport had reopened.

Text: Steve Smith has retired from one-day international cricket following Australia's semi-final exit from the Champions Trophy.
The 35-year-old made 170 appearances for Australia in his 50-over career, hitting 12 centuries and winning the ODI World Cup in 2015 and 2023.
Smith captained the side in Pat Cummins' absence during his final ODI appearance on Tuesday, when Australia suffered a four-wicket loss to India in Dubai in the Champions Trophy.
The former Sussex batsman will remain available for Test and T20 selection for his country.
"There have been so many amazing times and wonderful memories. Winning two World Cups was a great highlight along with the many fantastic team-mates who shared the journey," said Smith, Australian men's ODI player of the year in 2015 and 2021.
"Now is a great opportunity for people to start preparing for the 2027 ODI World Cup so it feels like the right time to make way.
"Test cricket remains a priority and I am really looking forward to the World Test Championship final, the West Indies in the winter and then England at home. I feel I still have a lot to contribute on that stage."
Smith hit the winning boundary as Australia beat New Zealand in the 2015 ODI World Cup final at the MCG.
He also played a key role eight years later as Australia upset hots India to win the tournament for a sixth time.
Smith finishes his ODI career with 5,800 runs, at an average of 43.28.
His highest score of 164 came against New Zealand at the SCG in 2016.
Matthew Henry, BBC Sport journalist in Dubai
Smith gave no hint at retirement in his news conference after defeat by India, but this decision is no surprise. He will be 38 by the time the next 50-over World Cup comes around in 2027.
He will go down as one of the great cricketers of his era, although still probably more for his Test exploits despite being a two-time World Cup winner.
A recent resurgence in red-ball cricket suggests he can continue there for a few years yet, beyond this winter's Ashes against England.
This retirement will give an early hint at the future of the Australia after their current crop - Mitchell Starc, Glenn Maxwell and Josh Hazlewood are 34 or older - move on.
Expect 21-year-old Cooper Connolly, who came in against India after injury to Matt Short, to be given opportunities.

Text: A second Sydney nurse who allegedly appeared in a video that made threats towards Israeli patients has been charged by police.
Ahmad Rashad Nadir, 27, and Sarah Abu Lebdeh, 26, were both suspended from their duties at Bankstown Hospital in February after the video was released online. It was filmed on an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a chat.
Authorities say there is "no evidence" the pair actually harmed patients.
Mr Nadir was charged on Wednesday with using a carriage service to threaten, menace or harass, and with possessing a prohibited drug.
Carriage services refer to modern communication systems such as phones and the internet.
Ms Lebdeh was charged last week with three offences: threatening violence to a group, using a carriage service to threaten to kill, and using a carriage service to harass or cause offence.
Neither person has entered a plea to the charges, but Mr Nadir apologised last month through his lawyer.
In the footage, which appeared to have been filmed inside a hospital and was published by an Israeli content creator, Ms Abu Lebdeh and Mr Nadir allegedly bragged about refusing to treat Israeli patients, killing them, and said they would go to hell.
The video spread widely online and caused public outcry, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese describing it as "disgusting" and "vile".
Earlier this month Australia passed tougher laws against hate crimes following a wave of unrelated antisemitic attacks.
In recent months, there have been a series of arson and graffiti incidents involving homes, cars, and synagogues in Jewish communities across Australia.
There have also been rising incidents of islamophobia. A Western Australian teenager was charged on Wednesday after allegedly threatening to launch a Christchurch massacre-inspired attack on a Sydney mosque.

Text: An adventurer who tried to row across the Pacific Ocean from the United States to Australia has been rescued just days before he reached his final destination.
Lithuanian rower Aurimas Mockus sounded a distress signal late on Friday after he was stranded by a cyclone, and surrounded by towering waves and strong winds packing up to 100 km/h (62 mph), local media reported.
Authorities made radio contact with Mr Mockus the next day when he was about 740km east of Mackay, a city on Australia's east coast in the Coral Sea.
By the time he was rescued on Monday morning, the 44-year-old had spent nearly five months alone at sea.
Mr Mockus is getting medical treatment on an Australian warship, which will take him to Sydney, the Australian navy said.
He was attempting to become one of few rowers who have crossed the Pacific alone and without stopping.
Among them are Britons Peter Bird and John Beeden, who achieved the feat in 1983 and 2015 respectively, and Australian Michelle Lee in 2023.
Mr Mockus started his 12,000km-long journey in October from San Diego in southern California. Brisbane was meant to be his destination.
He rowed for an average of 12 hours a day, according to local reports.
He regularly updated his progress on Instagram. In the latest post published a day before he called for help, Mr Mockus reported that he had crossed the Chesterfield Islands, a cluster of French coral islands about 1,500km east of Australia.
"The highlight is that I successfully sailed the reefs of Chesterfield Islands. And further as God allows... The most important thing is to hold back the next few days," he wrote.
Tropical Cyclone Alfred, which derailed Mr Mockus's plan, is forecast to hit Australia's eastern states of Queensland and New South Wales in the coming days.

Headline: Australian whose blood saved 2.4 million babies dies

Text: One of the world's most prolific blood donors - whose plasma saved the lives of more than two million babies - has died.
James Harrison died in his sleep at a nursing home in New South Wales, Australia on 17 February, his family said on Monday. He was 88.
Known in Australia as the man with the golden arm, Harrison's blood contained a rare antibody, Anti-D, which is used to make medication given to pregnant mothers whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies.
The Australian Red Cross Blood Service who paid tribute to Harrison, said he had pledged to become a donor after receiving transfusions while undergoing a major chest surgery when he was 14.
He started donating his blood plasma when he was 18 and continued doing so every two weeks until he was 81.
In 2005, he had the world record for most blood plasma donated - a title he held until 2022 when he was overtaken by a man in the US.
Harrison's daughter, Tracey Mellowship, said her father was "very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain".
"He always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own," she said.
Mellowship and two of Harrison's grandchildren are also recipients of anti-D immunisations.
"It made [James] happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness," she said.
Anti-D jabs protect unborn babies from a deadly blood disorder called haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn, or HDFN.
The condition occurs at pregnancy when the mother's red blood cells are incompatible with that of their growing baby.
The mother's immune system then sees the baby's blood cells as a threat and produces antibodies to attack them. This can seriously harm the baby, causing severe anaemia, heart failure, or even death.
Before anti-D interventions were developed in the mid-1960s, one in two babies diagnosed with HDFN died.
It is unclear how Harrison's blood came to be so rich in anti-D, but some reports said it had to do with the massive blood transfusion he received at 14.
There are fewer than 200 anti-D donors in Australia, but they help an estimated 45,000 mothers and their babies every year, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood.
Lifeblood has been working with Australia's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research to grow anti-D antibodies in the lab by replicating blood and immune cells from Harrison and other donors.
Researchers involved hope lab-made anti-D can one day be used to help pregnant women worldwide.
"Creating a new therapy has long been a 'holy grail'," Lifeblood's research director David Irving said.
He noted the scarcity of donors committed to regular donation, who are able to produce antibodies in sufficient quality and quantity.

Text: Australia left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann has had his bowling action cleared by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
The 28-year-old, who has played nine times for Australia, was reported for a suspect action during the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle earlier this month.
Subsequent independent testing has shown the bend in his elbow falls within the permitted 15 degrees, leaving him free to continue bowling.
"It was a disappointing way to finish what was such a successful Test series for Australia," Kuhnemann said in a statement on Thursday.
"I've never doubted my bowling action throughout my career and I'm always looking to improve the art of spin bowling in different conditions.
"I appreciated the professional manner in which testing was explained to me and then conducted."
Cricket Australia executive general manager Ben Oliver said: "We are pleased for Matt that this matter is now resolved.
"It has been a challenging period for Matt. However, he has carried himself exceptionally well.
"He has had the full support of Australian cricket and he can now move forward to the next phase of his international career with great confidence."
Kuhnemann took 16 wickets in the two-Test series against Sri Lanka and has 25 in five Tests. He has also played four one-day internationals.

Headline: Couple's trauma after body placed next to them on flight

Text: An Australian couple have spoken of the "traumatic" moment the body of a dead passenger was placed next to them on a Qatar Airways flight.
Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a dream holiday, told Australia's Channel 9 a woman had died in the aisle beside them during the flight from Melbourne to Doha.
The couple say cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him, despite there being empty seats.
Qatar Airways said it apologised for "any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused".
The couple said they had not been contacted or offered support by Qatar Airways or Qantas, the airline through which they booked the flight.
In a later statement on Wednesday, Qatar Airways said it had now spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns, as well as the family of the woman who died.
Mr Ring told Channel Nine's Current Affair programme that staff had responded "in no time" when the woman collapsed, but that "unfortunately the lady couldn't be saved, which was pretty heart-breaking to watch".
He said the cabin crew had tried to move her body towards business class "but she was quite a large lady and they couldn't get her through the aisle".
Mr Ring said the crew had seen seats were available beside him.
"They said, 'Can you move over please?' and I just said, 'Yes no problem'.
"Then they placed the lady in the chair I was in."
While Ms Colin was able to move to an empty seat nearby, Mr Ring said he had not been given the option to do so by cabin crew - even though there were vacant seats.
When the plane landed four hours later, he said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board.
He said ambulance officers had then started pulling blankets off the woman and he had seen her face.
The couple said there needed to be a "duty of care" for customers and staff.
"We should be contacted to make sure, do you need some support, do you need some counselling?"
Ms Colin called the experience "traumatic" and said: "We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board."
In its latest statement, Qatar Airways said: "We have been in contact with the family of the passenger who passed away to express our condolences on their loss. We have also directly spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns.
"The safety and comfort of all our passengers is of paramount importance to us."
A Qantas spokesperson said: "The process for handling incidents onboard an aircraft like this is managed by the operating airline, which in this case is Qatar Airways."
Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, said deaths in the air "occur more frequently than people would think" but said as a far as he was aware there was no specific protocol in place for such situations.
"On a long haul flight it tends to depend largely on when it occurs and where it occurs and what the crew have in terms of facilities to place the body somewhere because on an aeroplane, there's no access to the hold, there's a crew rest area but that's for the crew so it can be problematical."
A toilet area or galley area could be blocked off, he said, but the crew are required to keep a certain number of toilets available.
Mr Eustance said that, while he was not being judgemental as he did not know the full situation, he was surprised that the crew did not move Mr Ring if there had been spare seats.
"I would expect the crew would do all they could to avoid that. You are creating potential future liabilities in terms of the trauma of the people next to whom the body was placed," he said.
"In my experience the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons. You have a dead body that is uncontained and all that goes with it."

Headline: Religious sect parents jailed over death of diabetic daughter

Text: The parents of an eight-year-old diabetic girl in Australia who died after they denied her insulin for almost a week have each been sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter.
Elizabeth Struhs had in 2019 been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections.
Her parents belonged to a religious sect known as The Saints, who opposed medical care, believing God would heal her.
She died from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes at her home in Toowoomba west of Brisbane in January 2022.
Her father Jason Struhs and mother Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter last month.
The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens has been jailed for 13 years by the judge at the Supreme Court of Queensland, who called him a "dangerous, highly manipulative individual".
Eleven other members were handed jail terms of six to nine years.
Stevens and the girl's father had been on trial for murder but they were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty.
When handing down his almost 500-page verdict last month, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and "every member of the church including all other accused" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death.
"Due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."
Elizabeth would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness because she was denied medical care, prosecutor Caroline Marco said during the trial, which lasted several months and was heard by a judge sitting alone without a jury.
Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an "intelligent" child who suffered greatly in her final days.
The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for the girl as she lay on a mattress and her condition deteriorated.
Believing she could be brought back to life, the sect member made no effort to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, the court heard.
"Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again," her father Jason Struhs had earlier told the court.
Stevens, 63, had defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of "religious persecution". He said that the group was within its "rights to believe in the word of God completely".
Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin.
Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs had earlier said she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them.
She and other witnesses described the congregation as having strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were "pagan" or ungodly festivals.
The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and count around two dozen members from three families among its members.

Headline: Australia host loses job over offensive women's football remarks

Text: An Australian radio presenter has left the network after comments he made about the country's women's football team – which have been branded as misogynist and disrespectful.
Marty Sheargold said on nationwide radio station Triple M that the Matildas players reminded him of "year 10 girls" and implied that their matches were boring.
He apologised earlier on Wednesday, and was due to be back on air but did not appear in his usual time slot.
Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of Triple M, later said Sheargold and the station had agreed to "mutually part ways".
In a statement on Wednesday, Sheargold said that he fully understood the gravity of his remarks and would like to "sincerely apologise to the Matildas and the broader organisation".
The company said that it "takes its responsibility to listeners, shareholders, and clients seriously and its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience."
"Right now, it's clear this is a moment for reflection and review. Triple M, and the wider SCA network, will continue to take all necessary steps to support staff," the firm's chief content officer Dave Cameron said in a statement.
Earlier the sport's governing body said the remarks "diminish the extraordinary achievements" of a team that were semi-finalists in the women's world cup in 2023.
During his drivetime show on Monday afternoon, Sheargold interjected during a sports bulletin - which was discussing Australia's defeat to the US in its second consecutive loss in the SheBelieves Cup.
"You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls," Sheargold said, to the laughter of his co-hosts.
"All the infighting and all the friendship issues... Now I'm sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that's what I think of it."
When his colleague mentioned the SheBelieves Cup by name, Sheargold interrupted saying: "Oh, she believes in what? It better be men."
And when reference was made to Australia hosting the AFC Women's Asian Cup next year, he said "oh god - the Asian Cup", before criticising the event with an obscene comment. He then asked his co-host: "Got any men's sport?"
Sheargold's comments later went viral.
Minister for Sport Anika Wells called the comments "boorish, boring and wrong".
"Australia's most watched television event ever was the Matildas World Cup semi-final; the Tillies' quarterfinal is the second-most-watched event in Australian history," Ms Wells said.
Australian Olympian Ambrosia Malone, who represents her country in hockey, also criticised Sheargold.
"All I could think about was the young girls sitting in the car with their parents, maybe on the way to or from their own training sessions hearing this," she wrote on social media.
"I'm sure many of them would have been hurt and confused… I was in disbelief.
"This is apparently acceptable on mainstream afternoon radio??? HOW??"
Football Australia said it was "deeply disappointed by the unacceptable comments" which "fail to recognise the profound impact they have had on Australian sport and society".
"This incident is a stark reminder of the responsibility media outlets and personalities have in fostering respectful and constructive discussions about women's sport and its participants," it added.

Headline: Neighbours cancelled again, two years after revival

Text: Beloved Australian soap drama Neighbours has been cancelled again, two years after it was saved by Amazon MGM Studios.
Without specifying a reason, Amazon confirmed the series will finish at the end of 2025 - 40 years and more than 9,000 episodes after its television debut.
It was dropped by Channel 5 in 2022, but revived by Amazon for its streaming platforms just four months after a star-studded farewell episode watched by millions.
The soap - which helped launched the careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie - has long been a huge hit with Australian and UK audiences, and last year received its first Emmy nomination.
A statement on the show's social media said the soap would be "resting" from December.
"Audiences all around the world have loved and embraced Neighbours for four decades and we are very proud of the huge success over the last two years," executive producer Jason Herbison wrote.
"We value how much the fans love Neighbours and we believe there are more stories of the residents of Ramsay Street to tell in the future," Mr Hebrison added, hinting that the producers will again hunt for a new backer.
New episodes will continue to air on Amazon Prime Video and Australia's Channel Ten four times a week until the end of 2025.
In a statement, Amazon MGM Studios said it was "proud" to have played "a small part" in Neighbours history.
"Forty years is an incredible milestone," a spokesperson said.
Fans vented their disappointment at the decision.
One wrote on social media: "I refuse point blank to accept that they will try to take @neighbours from me AGAIN!!! It's sometimes the only 20 minutes in the day I can escape. Absolutely blooming well not!!"
Someone else wrote: "I can't begin to count the number of times I've logged into @primevideouk to be greeted by #Neighbours sitting at the top of the weekly charts.
"Now @amazon have cancelled the soap. At least a few of us will save money when we cancel though, right?"
Another said: "Will be so sad to say goodbye again, the joy & comfort this show has given for 40 years."
Set and filmed in Melbourne, Neighbours was first broadcast in Australia in 1985 and launched on BBC One a year later.
The show has lately featured more diverse characters and storylines, amid questions over how well it reflected modern Australia. It featured the first same-sex marriage on Australian TV.
It also had its controversies, however. A number of actors recently came forward with racism allegations, prompting production company Fremantle Media to promise a review.
News of the show's cancellation comes after actor Ian Smith - who plays Ramsay Street stalwart Harold Bishop - last year announced he would leave the show, revealing he has terminal cancer.
It also follows cutbacks elsewhere to TV soaps, including to the numbers of episodes of British shows Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks.

Headline: Children routinely using social media, Australian regulator says
Author: Graham Fraser, Technology Reporter

Text: More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.
It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.
The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.
The regulator accused the apps of "a lack of robust interventions" for checking the ages of their users.
The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube.
Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.
For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.
In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.
It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.
"The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps," said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant.
Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users.
In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram - took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. "This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban," said a TikTok spokesperson.
"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision."
A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies.
Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.
They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.
Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.
The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.
If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.
"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience," the report's authors said.
"However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account."
The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.
Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.
"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals," the report said.
"This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms."

Text: Australian police have charged a 31-year-old woman for assaulting two Muslim women at a shopping centre in Melbourne last week.
The woman from Pascoe Vale suburb is due in court on Wednesday, where it will be alleged that she targeted the two victims on 13 February because of their head coverings, local media report.
She allegedly grabbed and choked a 30-year-old pregnant woman using the latter's hijab at Epping shopping centre before pushing and slapping another 26-year-old woman in a separate assault 10 minutes later.
This comes two weeks after the country passed tough new laws against hate crimes following a recent string of high-profile antisemitic attacks.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday condemned the incident as "reprehensible". He rejected criticism that his government was taking Islamophobic attacks less seriously compared to antisemitic attacks.
"I take all attacks on people on the basis of their faith seriously, and they should all face the full force of the law," he told reporters.
Melbourne police say they are investigating reports of online threats against one of the two victims in the shopping centre. Both suffered non-life-threatening injuries.
On Tuesday, Australia's anti-Islamophobia envoy, Aftab Malik, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that "all forms of hate need to stop" and that the country's leaders must condemn the incident in Melbourne.
Earlier in the week, the president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Rateb Jneid, expressed alarm over attacks on Muslims in the country and called the government's response "grossly insufficient".
Australia's government has described new laws passed in early February as the "toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes".
It imposes mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years for the use of hate symbols such as the Nazi salute.
The reforms come as attacks on Jewish targets have become a topic of fierce debate in the country.
Last week, two Australian nurses were suspended after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them.
In late January, Sydney police found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note. A week before that, set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages

Headline: Scores of whales to be euthanised after mass stranding in Australia

Text: Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.
A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.
They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.
Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.
False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.
Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.
Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.
"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'."
"It's just absolutely horrific."
The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.
"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania," he said.
"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else."
Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.
"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach," said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.
With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the "tough" and "confronting" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.
"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort," Dr Carlyon said.
That grim task - which involves shooting the animals - is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.
Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested "it may be a case of... letting nature run its course".
Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.
More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.
Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.
Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.
There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.
Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.

Headline: Not guilty - but how will Kerr trial affect her career?
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-02-12T18:11:58.881Z
Text: Sam Kerr may have been found not guilty of causing racially aggravated harassment but that is not the end of the story for one of women's football's most high-profile players.
There is a lingering question over how much lasting damage it will have on her reputation and career.
After the case, the Australia and Chelsea player apologised "for expressing myself poorly on what was a traumatic evening".
The trial heard Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis had been out drinking when they were driven to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi driver who complained that they had refused to pay clean-up costs after Kerr was sick, and Mewis had smashed the vehicle's rear window.
Kerr said she and her partner had feared for their lives and in an expletive-laden exchange, accused one of the police officers of being "stupid and white".
Kerr was supported by her parents and brother Levi throughout the case. Her fiancee Mewis was in the public gallery once she had finished giving evidence as a witness for the defence.
When the verdict was read out, Kerr did not show much emotion while Mewis was in tears in the public gallery. But when court broke, Kerr gave an enthusiastic thumbs up to her barrister, Grace Forbes.
When it came to character evidence, Kerr had the support of high-profile figures in the world of football as well as family and friends including former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes and captain Millie Bright, who provided written references.
Ex-Chelsea and England goalkeeper Carly Telford was the only character witness to give evidence in court, and said that while her former team-mate was "exuberant" on the pitch, she was "quite shy and humble" off it.
Kerr herself acknowledged that being reminded of her behaviour on the night in question was "embarrassing", and apologised in court and again in her post-trial statement for the way she had expressed herself.
The significance of this court case was not lost on Kerr or those associated with her.
Chelsea had a legal representative in court for the entirety of it, and Kerr made additions to her public relations team in advance of the trial getting under way.
Tim Crow, a sports marketing expert, said: "There are plenty of precedents for athletes coming back from controversies like this, and taking their careers to new heights.
"There are two critical factors for Sam Kerr going forward. The first is her performance on the field: everything flows from that. The second is how she chooses to portray herself off the field, in her own voice through the media to control the narrative, or through sponsors.
"On the latter, it will be interesting to see how her existing sponsors react, and if any new sponsors come forward to back her, as she is now on the front line of the culture wars, at least for the time being."
BBC Sport has contacted Kerr's personal sponsors - Nike, Commbank and Australian mobile phone service Mate - for comment.
It remains to be seen how supporters react when Kerr returns to the pitch for the first time following this trial.
Kerr has been the subject of abuse previously, including homophobia.
The announcement she is expecting a child with Mewis drew homophobic comments online, which were condemned by Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor.
Blues supporters groups have celebrated the verdict, with Chelsea Pride among those to post online tributes

to Kerr on Tuesday.
Chelsea have not yet made any comment about the case.
There was significant media interest in this case for the duration, not just among British media but Australian media.
The public gallery was so full that the court had to find extra seats for reporters, and each day there was a large number of camera crews and reporters filming and photographing Kerr's arrival at and departure from court.
Kerr is arguably the most famous sportswoman in Australia, having been the face of the Matildas' home World Cup in 2023 in which they came fourth.
Her status has seen Kerr become a symbol of Australia around the world outside of sport, and she was the national flag bearer at the coronation of King Charles III.
Following the outcome of the trial, Football Australia welcomed Kerr's statement, and spoke of her importance to the team.
"Sam has been a key figure in Australian football for many years, and we recognise the significant pressures that this matter has brought to everyone involved," the statement read.
Football Australia said it would "reflect with Sam on learnings from this matter", but stopped short of details, including whether Kerr would remain captain.
Reaction from the Australian public, when the BBC spoke to people on Bondi Beach in Sydney on Wednesday, was more mixed.
"I think people would make mistakes," said one person. "She's in the limelight and she has been a great role model for young girls. It's important for her to keep that, with everything she has done for female football in Australia."
"She obviously let herself down," said another. "I'm a bit surprised she has got away with it like she has. We'll see what comes from this for Chelsea and Australia I guess."
The not guilty verdict has not spared Kerr from criticism in the Australian media either.
Erin Smith, football writer for the Australian newspaper, said Kerr's behaviour was "unacceptable" for someone in a prominent leadership role.
"Football Australia needs to take a hard-line stance and send a message to the millions of Matildas fans that behaviour like this will not be swept under the rug and forgotten about," she wrote on Wednesday.
Alex Blair wrote for news.com.au that Kerr "could be facing an even bigger mountain to climb after her dramatic legal saga", and that she faced losing a chunk of her annual income - she earned a reported Aus$3.3m (£1.67m) in 2022 - if brands dropped her as a representative.
Writing for The Guardian Australia, Kieran Pender described the trial as "a Rorschach test, enabling observers to reach their own conclusions about the Matildas star well before a verdict was reached".
"Even before the verdict, it was clear that things will not be the same for Kerr, or Australian football, moving forward," he wrote. "The extent to which this incident tarnishes a glittering career, or is relegated to a footnote, remains to be seen."
Kerr remains a key figure for club and country, with both Chelsea and Australia keen to see her back on the pitch as soon as possible.
Now 31, Kerr made her senior international debut aged just 15 and has scored 69 goals in 128 appearances for the Matildas.
In 2019 she joined Chelsea, and was a key player in establishing them as the dominant WSL force under former manager Emma Hayes, winning five league titles.
She finished third in the Ballon d'Or Feminin voting in 2021 and 2022, then second in 2023. A "big-game player", she scored five goals in three successive FA Cup finals between 2021 and 2023, all won by Chelsea.
Kerr has not played since the end of 2023, suffering a serious knee injury during a winter training camp with Chelsea in January 2024.
Chelsea confirmed she had been training on grass on Wednesday and her return to action could be imminent, with reports suggesting

she will be fit to play for her club within a month.

Text: Australia spinner Matthew Kuhnemann has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action.
The 28-year-old was Australia's leading wicket-taker in their 2-0 Test series win in Sri Lanka but was reported following the second Test in Galle.
Kuhnemann will now have his action assessed to determine its legality and, if deemed illegal, the left-armer would be suspended from bowling until his action has been modified and passed a further assessment.
"The Australian team was notified of the match officials' referral following the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle and will support Matt through the process of clearing this matter," Cricket Australia said in a statement.
"This is the first time in eight years of professional cricket that his action been questioned.
"Cricket Australia will liaise closely with the ICC (International Cricket Council) and independent experts in line with ICC regulations."
The ICC says in its rules and regulations

that an illegal bowling action is "where a player is throwing rather than bowling the ball".
This is defined by the ICC as being "where the player's elbow extends by an amount of more than 15 degrees between their arm reaching the horizontal and the ball being released".
Kuhnemann is free to continue bowling in domestic cricket for Tasmania but is not permitted to bowl at international level until his action is cleared.

Text: Australia seamer Mitchell Starc has opted out of the Champions Trophy.
It continues a disruptive build-up for the two-time winners, who had already lost captain Pat Cummins, seamer Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh to injury, plus the sudden ODI retirement of all-rounder Marcus Stoinis.
Starc, 35, will not be sharing a reason for his decision and has asked for privacy.
The left-armer, who has taken 244 wickets in 127 one-day internationals, was the only Australia seamer to play in all seven Tests against India at home and Sri Lanka away between November and February.
It leaves Spencer Johnson, Nathan Ellis, Sean Abbott and Ben Dwarshuis, who have played in 37 ODIs between them, as Australia's frontline pace options.
"We understand and respect Mitch's decision," chair selector George Bailey said.
"Mitch is deeply respected for his commitment to international cricket and the priority he places on performing for Australia.
"His well-documented ability to play through pain and adversity, as well as forgoing opportunities in other parts of his career to put his country first should be applauded.
"His loss is of course a blow for the Champions Trophy campaign but does provide an opportunity for someone else to make a mark on the tournament."
Steve Smith has been appointed captain ahead of Travis Head in Cummins' absence.
The Champions Trophy starts on 19 February and Australia's first game is against England on 22 February.

Headline: Australian nurses suspended over 'vile' antisemitic video

Text: Two Australian nurses have been suspended after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them.
The man and woman - both employees at a Sydney hospital - are now being investigated by police, officials in New South Wales (NSW) said.
State Health Minister Ryan Park said that a "thorough investigation" would be carried out to make sure there had been "no adverse [patient] outcomes", but that a "rapid" examination of hospital records had not turned up anything unusual.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the video as "sickening and shameful" after it began circulating online.
It comes less than a week after Australia passed tougher laws against hate crimes following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks.
On Wednesday, NSW Police said that they believed they had "identified the individuals involved" in the video.
The health minister said both had been stood down immediately, and promised that they would never work in the NSW healthcare system again.
The video was shared on TikTok by content creator Max Veifer, who says he is from Israel.
His account features conversations with people he encounters on the app Chatruletka - an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a video chat.
The footage, seen by the BBC, appears to have been recorded in a hospital.
A man, who claims to be a doctor, tells Mr Veifer that he "has beautiful eyes" but adds "I'm sorry you're Israeli" before saying he sends Israelis to Jahannam - an Islamic place akin to hell.
He goes on to make a throat-slitting gesture, before a woman comes on screen and says that "one day" Mr Veifer's "time will come" and that he will die, later adding that she won't treat Israelis.
"I won't treat them, I will kill them," she says.
The video has been edited, emojis have been added, and some comments have been bleeped out - but authorities are not questioning its authenticity.
Albanese described it as "disgusting" and "vile", writing on X: "These antisemitic comments, driven by hate, have no place in our health system and no place anywhere in Australia.
"Individuals found to have committed criminal antisemitic acts will face the full force of our laws."
Park also apologised to the Jewish community, and said he wanted to reassure them that they could still expect "first class" health care in NSW.
"There is no place in our hospital and health system for this sort of view to ever, ever take place. There is no place for this sort of perspective in our society."
He added that staff at the hospital in the suburb of Bankstown were embarrassed and ashamed, but said it did not diminish the good work they did.
In recent months, in incidents unconnected to the hospital video, there have been a series of arson and graffiti attacks involving homes, cars, and synagogues in Jewish areas across Australia, causing fear in the community.
A caravan packed with power gel explosives that police warned had the potential to cause a "mass casualty event" was found in NSW in January, alongside a document with antisemitic sentiments and a list of Jewish targets in Sydney.
The co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said the video served as a "warning sign once again to all Australians about the evil that exists in our midst".

Headline: 'Grease and rags' sewer fatberg halts Bryan Adams concert

Published Date: 2025-02-10T03:03:05.962Z
Text: A "large" sewer blockage caused by "fat, grease and rags" has forced the cancellation of a Bryan Adams concert in Australia on public health grounds.
The Grammy Award winning artist was due to perform at the RAC Arena in Perth on Sunday, but the city's water corporation said a blocked main risked backing up the venue's toilets.
Adams apologised to fans on social media - many of whom had lined up for hours only to be turned away - and thanked them for their "patience and support" before promising to try to reschedule the show.
The concert promoter said the cancellation was "bitterly disappointing" and would provide ticketholders with a full refund.
"While every effort was made for the show to proceed, this matter was outside of the control of Bryan Adams, Frontier Touring and RAC Arena," it wrote in a statement.
Perth's water corporation said the fatberg responsible for the disruption had already "caused several wastewater overflows" on the main road near the venue and urged the public to avoid direct contact with "pooled water" in the area.
"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will provide further updates as required," it said in a post on Facebook, advising of the cancellation.
Adams - who is known for his tracks such as Summer of '69 and Please Forgive Me - made his Australian debut in 1984 and has remained a beloved performer across the country ever since.
"I'm really sorry we couldn't make this happen tonight — I was so looking forward to seeing you all," he posted on social media on Sunday.
The Canadian rock star is still due to play in Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne later this week.
Found in sewers around the world, fatbergs are formed when fat, oil and grease solidify and bind with items such as rags, or wet wipes.
They are known to cause serious blockages and environmental hazards. Last year, a fatberg weighing roughly the same as three double-decker buses was cleared from an east London sewer. And New York, Denver, Melbourne and Valencia have all found giant fatbergs blocking their waterways in recent years.

Headline: Woman's deepfake betrayal by close friend: 'Every moment turned into porn'
Author: Tiffanie Turnbull, BBC News, Sydney

Text: Warning: Contains offensive language and descriptions of sexual violence
It was a warm February night when an ominous message popped into Hannah Grundy's inbox in Sydney.
"I will just keep emailing because I think this is worthy of your attention," the anonymous sender wrote.
Inside was a link, and a warning in bold: "[This] contains disturbing material."
She hesitated for a moment, fearing it was a scam.
The reality was so much worse. The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats.
"You're tied up in them," she recalls. "You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage."
Written in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out.
That email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards.
The web page was called "The Destruction of Hannah", and at the top of it was a poll where hundreds of people had voted on the vicious ways they wanted to abuse her.
Below was a thread of more than 600 vile photos, with Hannah's face stitched on to them. Buried in between them were chilling threats.
"I'm closing in on this slut," the main poster said.
"I want to hide in her house and wait until she is alone, grab her from behind and... feel her struggle."
It's been three years now, but the 35-year-old school teacher has no trouble recalling the "pure shock" that coursed through when she and partner Kris Ventura, 33, opened the page.
"You immediately feel unsafe," Hannah tells me, eyes wide as she grips a mug of peppermint tea in her living room.
Clicking through the website Kris had also found photos of their close friends, along with images depicting at least 60 other women, many also from Sydney.
The couple quickly realised the pictures used to create the deepfakes were from the women's private social media accounts. And the penny dropped: this was someone they all knew.
Desperate to find out who, Hannah and Kris spent hours at the kitchen table, identifying the women, searching their social media friends lists for a common link, and methodically building a dossier of evidence.
Within four hours, they had a list of three potential suspects.
On it, but immediately discounted, was their close friend from university Andrew Hayler. The trio had met while working at a campus bar, and the staff there quickly formed deep friendships.
And Andy, as they called him - the supervisor - was the glue of the group.
He was considerate and affable, Hannah says - the kind of guy who looked out for women in the bar and made sure his female friends got home safely after a night out.
They all hung out regularly, went on holidays together, loved and trusted each other.
"I thought of him as a very close friend," Hannah says.
"We were just so sure that he was a good person."
But soon they'd whittled down the list to just one name: his.
When Hannah woke the next morning and went to the police station, mingling with her shock and horror was a "naive" sliver of optimism.
"We thought they'd go grab him that afternoon," Kris says with a wry smile.
Instead, Hannah says she was met with disdain.
She recalls one New South Wales Police officer asking what she'd done to Andy. At one stage they suggested Hannah simply ask him to stop. Later, they pointed to a picture of her in a skimpy outfit and said "you look cute in this one", she says.
New South Wales Police declined to comment to the BBC on the specifics of Hannah's case.
But she says the way her complaint was handled made her feel like she was making "a big deal out of nothing".
"And for me, it felt quite life-changing," says Hannah.
Any faith she still held that police would help quickly dwindled.
Amid delays, she turned to Australia's eSafety Commissioner, but under its powers as a regulatory body it could only offer help in taking the content down.
Desperate, the couple hired a lawyer and commissioned a digital forensics analyst to move things along.
In the meantime, to avoid tipping Andy off and to keep themselves safe, they retreated inwards.
"The world for you just gets smaller. You don't speak to people. You don't really go out," Hannah says.
Intense fear and loneliness filled the void instead.
"We'd already had to suspend complete belief to understand that he'd done these things, so [the idea of] him actually coming to try and rape you or hurt you isn't that much of a bigger stretch."
The couple installed cameras all around their house and set up location tracking on Hannah's devices. She began wearing a health watch 24/7, so someone would know if her heartbeat rose - or ceased.
"I stopped having the windows open because I was scared... maybe someone would come in," Hannah explains.
"We slept with a knife in both of our bedside tables because we just thought: 'What if?'"
Still feeling abandoned by police, Kris had taken on the burden of monitoring the site for the slightest sign of escalation towards Hannah and any of their friends - who, to protect the investigation, still did not know anything.
Guilt ate at the pair: "We had a constant battle about whether it was right to not tell them," Hannah says.
At one point told the investigation had been suspended, Hannah and Kris forked out even more money for a detailed forensic report, and threatened to make a formal complaint to the police watchdog. All up, they spent over A$20,000 (£10,200; $12,400) trying to protect themselves and stop Andy.
Finally a new detective was assigned and within two weeks police were raiding Andy's house. He admitted everything.
Filled with relief, then dread, Hannah began calling her friends to break the news.
"My stomach just dropped," Jessica Stuart says, recalling the moment she learned what Andy had done to her photos.
"I felt really violated but… I don't think I fully comprehended."
For her, again, the sucker punch was that a friend who she loved like "family" was behind the crime. Andy had always appeared "so unassuming" and "really thoughtful" - someone she'd called for help through a difficult time.
"It's been really hard to reconcile that those two people are actually the same person."
The case was uncharted territory for Australia.
For at least a decade, experts have warned advances in technology would lead to a wave of AI crimes. But authorities have been caught on the back foot, leaving deepfake victims - overwhelmingly women - vulnerable.
At the time Andy was arrested in 2022, there was no offence for creating or sharing deepfake pornography in NSW, or anywhere else in Australia, and the country had never seen a case of this magnitude before.
The 39-year-old was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence - a low-level catch-all offence for many internet crimes - and Hannah was warned to keep her expectations low.
"We were prepared to go to court and for him to get a slap on the wrist," she says.
But she and the 25 other women who decided to be part of the case were determined Andy be held accountable. One after the other, several gave crushing statements at his sentencing hearing last year.
"You didn't just betray my friendship, but you shattered the sense of safety I used to take for granted," Jess told the court. "The world feels unfamiliar and dangerous, I am constantly anxious, I have nightmares when I am able to sleep.
"Forming new friendships feels impossible, burdened by the constant question: 'Could this person be like you?'"
When it came time for Andy to apologise to the women he'd targeted, Jess and Hannah couldn't stomach being in the room. They walked out.
"There is nothing that he can say to me that makes it better, and I wanted him to know that," Hannah says.
Andy told the court that creating the images had felt "empowering" as "an outlet" for a "dark" part of his psyche, but that he didn't think they would cause real harm.
"I have really done a terrible thing and I am so very sorry," he said.
Judge Jane Culver was not convinced of his remorse, saying while there was "some contrition", he didn't seem to understand the clearly "profound and ongoing" suffering that his "prolific" and "disturbing" offending had caused.
She sentenced Andy to nine years in jail - in what has been called a landmark decision.
"The gasp that went through the court... it was such a relief," Jess says.
"It was the first time I felt like we had actually been listened to."
Andy will be eligible for parole in December 2029, but has told the court he intends to challenge his sentence.
Nicole Shackleton, a law expert who researches technology and gender, told the BBC the "unprecedented" case set a surprising, and significant, legal standard for future cases.
The judge had recognised "this wasn't merely something that happened online" and that such behaviour was "tied to offline violence against women", said Dr Shackleton, from Melbourne's RMIT University.
But Australia and other countries remain poor at regulating the use of AI and proactively investigating its misuse, experts like her argue.
Australia has recently criminalised the creation and sharing of deepfake pornography at a national level. But many other countries have legislation accused of containing loopholes, or do not criminalise deepfake pornography at all. In the UK, sharing it is an offence, but creating or soliciting it is not - though this is about to change.
And in the face of under-trained and under-resourced police forces, many victims like Hannah or private investigators - like the one who tipped her off - are left to be de facto detectives and regulators.
In a statement, NSW Police said investigations into AI crimes are a challenging, "resource and time intensive process", and training has recently been beefed up "with the goal that every officer... can respond to these types of crimes effectively".
The force also works with the eSafety Commissioner and tech companies to take down deepfake abuse, the statement added.
eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said removal of the distressing material is the top priority for most victim-survivors, and eSafety had "an extremely high success rate in achieving it".
But eSafety does not have the punitive powers to pursue criminal investigations and penalties, she added in a statement to the BBC.
"You can have whatever laws you like, [but] if you have a police force that are incompetent..." Kris says, trailing off.
"We're obviously angry at Andy. But it is also disgusting that the only way you get justice with something like this is if you're two people in your 30s that can afford to bully the police."
They're determined for things to be different for future victims. In the past six months alone, two schoolboys in separate cases in NSW and Victoria have been reported to police for allegedly creating mass deepfake nudes of their classmates.
After several years of hell, Hannah is also trying to move on.
But Andy's looming appeal threatens the hard work she's done to rebuild her life and mental health.
Knees at her chest and feet tucked under her on the couch, she says Andy got the sentence he deserved.
"Because for me, and for the other girls, it is forever… they will always be on the internet," she says.
She still pays for a service which scours the web for the pictures, and she worries about future friends, employers, students - her own children - finding them.
One of her biggest fears is that her best memories will never be reclaimed.
"You post things on Facebook and Instagram because they're the happiest moments of your life. You get a dog, you buy a house, you get engaged and you post a photo.
"He had turned every single one of those moments for us into porn. And so when you see that photo… well, now I see myself getting raped."

Text: Australian reptile handlers say they have been stunned to rescue 102 venomous snakes from a backyard mulch pile in Sydney.
Cory Kerewaro said his business was initially called to rescue "a bunch" of the reptiles after one was reported to have bitten a dog at the property.
When his colleague arrived, he discovered 40 red-bellied black snakes - four of which gave birth to more live young once he had placed them in a removal bag.
Red-bellied black snakes are one of the most common venomous species in Australia but have not caused any human deaths on record.
The five adult and 97 baby snakes are currently under quarantine and will be released into a national park once the weather cools.
Mr Kerewaro said it was as record haul for the snake handlers, who normally catch between five and 15 reptiles per day.
He said he recalls colleague Dylan Cooper calling him within 15 minutes to say: "Mate, I'm going to be here a while. It's a pretty big pile... I'm already over 15 snakes!"
"I thought he was stitching me up."
The dog was "alive and well" after the incident which happened on Boxing Day, he added.
Female red-bellied black snakes often gather in small groups when they are ready to give birth, possibly to protect against predators, according to Mr Kerewaro.
They are the only snake of their genus to give live birth, the Australian Museum says on its website.
The species is considered to be shy, and bites - though uncommon - can cause swelling, nausea and diarrhoea.
Snake catchers are required by law to release the animals close to where they were found. But given the size this discovery, the catchers have been given permission to release the snakes into a national park away from human interactions.

Text: Australia all-rounder Marcus Stoinis has retired from one-day internationals with immediate effect, ruling him out of the Champions Trophy.
Stoinis, 35, played six matches in Australia's 2023 World Cup win and, despite playing just one ODI since, was in line to feature in the upcoming Champions Trophy in place of the injured Cameron Green.
"This wasn't an easy decision but I believe it's the right time for me to step away from ODIs and fully focus on the next chapter of my career," Stoinis said.
"I've got a fantastic relationship with Ron [coach Andrew McDonald] and I've hugely appreciated his support.
"I'll be cheering the boys on in Pakistan."
The retirement is further disruption to Australia's Champions Trophy preparation.
Captain Pat Cummins, fellow bowler Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder and vice-captain Mitchell Marsh have all been ruled out with injury.
Australia have until 12 February to finalise their squad. Steve Smith and Travis Head are being considered as captaincy options for the tournament which begins on 19 February.
Leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha, all-rounders Sean Abbott and Cooper Connolly, batter Jake Fraser-McGurk, and left-armers Ben Dwarshuis and Spencer Johnson, have been added to the squad for two ODIs against Sri Lanka next week.
Stoinis, who will continue to be available for T20s for Australia, played 71 ODIs after making his debut in 2015.
He scored 1,495 runs at an average of 26.69 with a high score of 146 not out against New Zealand in 2017 - his only international century.
He has also taken 48 wickets.
"Playing ODI cricket for Australia has been an incredible journey, and I'm grateful for every moment I've had in the green and gold," Stoinis said.
"Representing my country at the highest level is something I'll always cherish."

Headline: Mandatory jail for Nazi salutes under new Australia laws

Text: Hate symbols and terror offences will be punishable with mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years in Australia, after parliament passed a series of amendments to hate crime laws on Thursday.
The new laws were passed following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks which have become a major topic of debate in the country.
The amendments have been described by the government as the "toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes".
But critics say that the governing Labor Party is caving to opposition demands and going against its own policy of opposing mandatory jail sentences.
Under the amendments, displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute is now punishable with at least one year in prison.
Other penalties include a minimum of three years for financing terrorism and six years for committing or planning terrorist acts.
There have been several attacks on Jewish targets in Australia in recent months.
Last week authorities in Sydney found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note.
The discovery came just a week after a childcare centre near a Jewish school and synagogue in Sydney was set on fire and antisemitic graffiti was seen on one of its walls.
In December, a synagogue in Melbourne was set alight with worshippers inside. No-one was seriously hurt in the incident, which sent shockwaves through the country.
Former Labor senator Kim Carr criticised the party for what he said was a "clear breach of the Labor party national platform".
Labor opposes mandatory sentences on the grounds that such penalties do not reduce crime, undermine the courts' independence and are often discriminatory in practice.
But opposition parties did not rush to welcome the new amendments either, accusing Labor of dragging its feet.
"The parliament is not acting today because of the decisiveness of the Labor Party," Liberal senator James Paterson told reporters in Canberra.
"The prime minister has been dragged kicking and screaming to finally introduce tough legislation that will ensure there are real penalties for this behaviour."
Performing the Nazi salute and displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika, have been banned since January 2024 and carry up to one year in jail. The amendments on Thursday make the jail term mandatory.
"This is not about politics," Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday night as the amendments were introduced to parliament.
"This is about whether the Australian Parliament believes it's acceptable to advocate, threaten or commit violence against another person because of who they are, who they pray to or who they love."

Headline: Scientists produce first kangaroo embryo using IVF

Text: Australian scientists have produced the world's first kangaroo embryo through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a breakthrough they say could help save other species from extinction.
Using specimens from eastern grey kangaroos, the researchers successfully injected a single sperm cell into an egg, but said achieving a live birth would require more work and "technical advancements".
The feat provides important insights into marsupial breeding and could aid efforts to improve the genetic diversity of endangered species such as the koala, Tasmanian devil, northern hairy-nosed wombat and Leadbeater's possum, lead researcher Andres Gambini said.
Australia houses the largest variety of marsupial mammals, but it also has the highest rate of mammal extinctions.
The University of Queensland experiment looked at the growth of kangaroo eggs and sperm in a laboratory setting before creating embryos using a method known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
The technique, which is already used on humans and some domestic animals, was tried on eastern grey kangaroos that had died. The species was selected because it is not endangered and has existing high populations.
Despite how iconic marsupial species are in Australia and the crucial role they play in its biodiversity, studies into their tissues have been limited, scientists say.
"We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm," said Dr Gambini, adding that such methods would play a crucial role in safeguarding "the genetic material of these unique and precious animals".
IVF is being used as a tool to try and preserve endangered species the world over.
Last year, scientists achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother in Kenya.
In 2018, IVF was also used to create the world's first donkey embryo.

Text: Australia captain Pat Cummins is "hugely unlikely" to be fit for the Champions Trophy, says coach Andrew McDonald.
Fast bowler Cummins, 31, is absent from the ongoing Test series in Sri Lanka because of the birth of his second child, but also has an ankle problem.
Fellow paceman Josh Hazlewood, who has been sidelined with calf and side issues and was named in Australia's preliminary squad alongside Cummins, is also a doubt.
"Patty is hugely unlikely, which is a bit of shame, and we've also got Josh Hazlewood, who is battling [to be fit] at the moment," McDonald told radio station SEN.
"So that medical information will land over the next couple of days and we'll be able to shore that up and let everyone know the direction."
Cummins' absence would leave 50-over world champions Australia with a decision to make over the captaincy, with all-rounder and vice-captain Mitchell Marsh already out with a back issue.
McDonald said Steve Smith, who is currently leading in Cummins' absence in Sri Lanka and has captained Australia in 59 one-day internationals, and fellow batter Travis Head are the two options being considered.
Head has never been captain in ODIs but has been in charge for one T20 - a defeat by England in Cardiff last year.
"Pat Cummins hasn't been able to resume any type of bowling so he's heavily unlikely, so that would mean that we do need a captain," McDonald said.
"They'll be the two that we look at for that leadership post."
The Champions Trophy, held in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, begins on 19 February.
Australia are in a group with England, Afghanistan and South Africa and meet England in their opening fixture on 22 February.
Teams have until Wednesday, 12 February to make changes to their preliminary squads. Left-armer Mitchell Starc and seamer Nathan Ellis are currently the only fit quick bowlers in Australia's squad.
Seamer Sean Abbott, left-armer Spencer Johnson and quick Lance Morris were part of the squad beaten 2-1 at home by Pakistan in Australia's most recent ODI series.

Text: A second woman is confirmed to have died in flooding which has inflicted "incredible" devastation on communities in northern Australia.
Police said the 82-year-old woman's body was found in a cane paddock in Queensland on Tuesday, two days after a 63-year-old woman died when a dinghy she was in overturned during a rescue attempt.
The region has been inundated since Saturday, with parts of northern Queensland seeing nearly 2m (6.5 ft) of rain.
By Tuesday, conditions were starting to ease - although Queensland Premier David Crisafulli warned it was still "a disaster that's going to test the resolve of people" during an interview with broadcaster ABC.
He described the devastation as "incredible", but noted weather conditions had been "really kind" in recent hours. Thousands had begun to return to their homes.
In Townsville, locals woke on Tuesday to grey skies and drizzle, and the news that predicted flooding levels had not materialised there. It was a stark contrast to the intense downpours which have battered the region over the past few days.
"We believe that the danger has passed," Townsville Local Disaster Management Group chair Andrew Robinson told reporters.
Pointing to earlier forecasts which had suggested up to 2,000 Townsville homes could have faced flood risks, Crisafulli said that "the city had dodged a bullet".
Local resident Jo Berry told the BBC she and her family were among those returning home on Tuesday, after spending a sleepless night monitoring the rainfall.
"People talk about PTSD when it rains here and I totally understand," says Ms Berry, formerly from Leicester in the UK.
"We've been in the house here for over 20 years, and have been through a few cyclone events and the 2019 flooding so it is not our first rodeo," she adds, referring to a flooding disaster which caused A$1.24bn (£620m; $770m) in damage.
On Monday night, other local residents told the BBC they were "on a knife edge" as they waited to see whether their houses would survive.
But further north in the state, power outages and damaged roads have made it difficult to assess the full extent of the destruction in towns such as Ingham and Cardwell.
Crisafulli said early reports suggested the damage was "quite frankly incredible" and that Ingham, which is almost entirely without electricity, "remains the biggest challenge".
"There are people who have been inundated at home, in their businesses and in their farms," he told reporters on Tuesday.
Footage published in local media showed long lines at the town's supermarket as people waited for critical supplies. Crisafulli said that amid the blackout the local hospital was operating as normal, and a petrol station was open.
The flooding has caused damage to the area's homes, crops and coastline, local MP Nick Dametto said in a video posted online.
"The inundation is something that I have never seen before," he said.
Home to fewer than 5,000 people, Ingham was already reeling after the 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday.
The second woman's body was found on Tuesday just north of Ingham after a neighbour raised the alarm. She was last seen on Monday night in a house, Queensland Police said in a statement.
More than 8,000 properties remain without power across northern Queensland, according to the state's energy provider, and the partial collapse of a critical highway continues to hinder efforts to assist some of the hardest-hit areas.
Crisafulli said the recovery effort would "take some time" and that the priority in the coming hours would be to work with the army to get power generators to isolated communities and "bring them back online".
He added that federal funding would help reconstruct the battered Bruce Highway - the state's main thoroughfare which stretches 1,673km (1,039 miles) from the south.
Located in the tropics, northern Queensland is vulnerable to destructive cyclones, storms, and flooding.
Speaking to the BBC in Townsville, Scott Heron, a local resident and climate expert, said the latest disaster was not unexpected.
"For a long time, climate scientists have been clear that extreme weather events will become more extreme, and we are seeing that," said Prof Heron , who works at James Cook University and is the Unesco Chair on Climate Vulnerability of Heritage.
Prof Heron urged politicians to consider this as they planned recovery and rebuilding efforts, such as to the Bruce Highway.
It would be "wasting public money" if infrastructure planning, particularly for long-term projects including roads and bridges, did not "incorporate changing threats due to climate change", he said.

Text: Sunk into a camping chair wearing shorts and in his Led Zeppelin T-shirt, John Duric looks relaxed.
In the arm of the seat, a drinks pocket holds an icy bottle of beer. But on the ground next to him, a pile of half a dozen sandbags, ready to go.
Mr Duric lives across the street from the Ross River – overflowing and fast-moving – in Idalia, one of six suburbs labelled "black zones" in Townsville, one of the areas hardest hit by a flooding emergency in Queensland state in Australia.
Authorities have urged people living in those spots to leave. They were given a deadline of noon on Sunday, but like plenty of others, Mr Duric has opted to stay put.
"We've only been here 12 months, so I've relied on a lot of information from people around us," he says.
"We were thinking about moving out, but we have pets, we've got nowhere to go so have decided to follow the neighbour's advice and stay.
"We haven't panicked but we are prepared. Let's hope for the best and hope we don't have to use the sand bags."
The city has been inundated with more than 600mm (23.6in) of rain in the past week. Other parts of the state of Queensland have seen almost 1.3m of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow, with officials suggesting as many as 2,000 homes could be inundated before the water reached its peak.
But by late Monday afternoon, both the cloud and the mood had lifted. The first break in the rain for days bringing smiles, and curiosity, as locals headed out to inspect the waterways.
For Daniel Watts, walking the dog with his family, there's a glimmer of optimism that their home will not suffer the same fate as during floods here six years ago – when water rose 1.5 metres and his property had to be gutted.
"It's been on a knife edge as to whether our house will get inundated or not, so there's been quite a bit of anxiety," he told the BBC.
"Luckily, it hasn't yet. And at this stage, the dam levels are retreating, which is good. It's still wait and see, though. It wouldn't take much."
The Townsville Disaster Management Group expects the Ross River to peak between 07:00 and 08:00 on Tuesday (21:00 to 22:00GMT).
"We're not quite out of the woods yet," Queensland state Premier David Crisafulli told ABC News.
But Mr Watts is taking comfort from Monday's easing weather – a contrast to 2019 when, he says, the rain "just did not stop".
"Having a bit of a reprieve is from the rain is really good," he said.
"It gives everything just time. It gives time for the river and the dam, but we'll see. It's not over."

Text: A teenage girl has died after being attacked by a shark in Queensland, Australia.
Paramedics responded to reports of a "serious shark bite incident" at Woorim Beach, just north of Brisbane, around 16:45 local time (06:45 GMT) on Monday, Queensland Ambulance Service wrote on X.
Police confirmed that the girl had suffered life-threatening injuries and died shortly after 17:00. Australian media reports that she was 17 years old.
The waters around the beach are home to many sharks, but the attack occurred close to shore in the popular surfing spot, which has measures to protect against sharks.
Police confirmed the girl had been swimming in the waters off Bribie Island - just off the mainland, on which Woorim Beach sits - when she was attacked by the shark, the species of which has not been identified.
The Queensland Ambulance Service confirmed the victim suffered life-threatening injuries to her upper body.
She was bitten on the arm around 100m from shore, Australian media reports.
Christopher Potter arrived at the beach shortly after the attack happened. He told ABC News: "There are a lot of swimming groups that swim along here, morning and afternoon.
"It's known there are a lot of sharks around Bribie, but this close to shore, it's still a shock."
The waters near the beach are protected with drumlines - barrels anchored to the sea floor which have baited hooks to catch sharks that get too close.
Target species caught in these are then euthanised, while other species are relocated and released.
Police said they will prepare a report on Monday's incident for the coroner.
It is the second shark fatality in Australia's waters this year, after surfer Lance Appleby was killed off the coast of South Australia on 2 January.
The last fatal attack in the Greater Brisbane area came in 2006, when 21-year-old Sarah Whiley was killed while swimming with friends.
Shark attacks in Queensland "happen rarely and most shark species do not pose a risk to people", according to the state government's website.

Text: Australian authorities are scrambling to help isolated communities in Queensland after a flooding emergency forced thousands of evacuations, cut power to homes and washed away sections of a vital highway.
The flooding has claimed a woman's life and caused havoc across the state's north, with residents in Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell among the hardest hit.
"Record" downpours are set to continue, authorities say, with parts of the region already experiencing almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese - who was briefed about the response efforts on Monday - said that the disaster had brought out "the best of Australians".
"I've seen Australians helping one another in their time of need," he wrote on X, adding that the "threat from floodwaters" would persist in affected areas for days.
Efforts to assist the hardest-hit areas have been hindered by flood damage to parts of the Bruce Highway - the main thoroughfare stretching 1,673km (1039 miles) from the state's south.
This included the partial collapse of a bridge that could add an extra 700km to driving routes and slow down the delivery of critical supplies, the Queensland Trucking Association told the ABC.
Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli offered his condolences to the "tight-knit" town of Ingham, after a 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday.
"We are deeply sorry for their loss," he told reporters on Monday.
Crisafulli also urged all residents located in the so-called "black-zone" of the floods - which includes six Townsville suburbs - to not return home, due to the ongoing threat posed by the nearby Ross River.
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the area had received six months of rainfall in three days.
About 2,000 homes could be inundated as water levels rise before their expected peak on Tuesday, the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group warned.
Many homes have already been flooded. One Ingham resident who lives with her elderly mother told the Townsville Bulletin that she had waited seven hours for emergency services to help them evacuate after their property was affected.
"I was crying, I was hysterical. Someone even hung up on me when I called [emergency number] triple-0, saying: 'We're busy,'" she said.
Though rainfall is now easing, major flood warnings remain in place for communities along several rivers.
Crisafulli has warned that Ingham could be on track to experience its worst flooding in 60 years if the Herbert river surpasses a peak of 15.2m.
Emergency responders have continued working around the clock, with the SES receiving 480 calls for help on Sunday night and performing 11 "swift water" rescues. Widespread power outages continue to be reported, making it impossible for some communities to call for assistance.
SES Deputy Commissioner Shane Chelepy urged people to stay vigilant and check on their neighbours when possible. He added that some 400 people were now being housed in evacuation centres across Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell.
Authorities have also asked locals to be on the lookout for crocodiles, saying that they could be lurking in streams away from their usual habitats.
Located in the tropics, north Queensland is vulnerable to destructive cyclones, storms, and flooding.
But climate scientists have warned that warmer oceans and a hotter planet are creating the conditions for more intense and frequent extreme rainfall events.

Text: A woman has died in Australia and thousands have been forced to flee their homes after torrential rainfall caused flooding in northern Queensland.
Authorities say waters will continue to rise and have warned of a "dangerous and life-threatening" situation, with parts of the region recording almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday.
"Record" downpours are set to continue into Monday, according to Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli.
Meteorologists say these could be the worst floods in the region in more than 60 years.
Crisafulli said conditions were unlike anything northern Queensland had experienced "for a long time".
"It's not just the intensity, but it's also the longevity of it," he told Australian broadcaster ABC.
The woman who died was onboard a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy which hit a tree and capsized in the town of Ingham.
It is understood she was a member of the public who was being rescued at the time, and was not an emergency worker. The other five people on board were able to get to safety. An investigation has been launched.
Meanwhile, three people were rescued from the roof of a house in Cardwell, about halfway between Cairns and Townsville.
Video has emerged showing a man clinging to a pole in Ingham after his vehicle was washed away - and being taken to safety by locals in a boat.
The Townsville Local Disaster Management Group says that 2,000 homes in the city may be inundated - some up to the second floor - as river levels rise.
Thousands of people across six Townsville suburbs were told to leave their homes by midday on Sunday, but officials say about 10% of residents had opted to stay.
The same areas were severely hit during 2019 flooding.
Premier Crisafulli urged people to heed the warnings, saying: "In the end, houses and cars and furniture, that can all be replaced. Your family can't".
On Sunday night local time a new evacuation centre was being opened - as others reached capacity.
Parts of the road on a major highway collapsed, hampering efforts to get rescue teams and sandbags to the worst-hit areas.
Meanwhile supermarkets had run out of fresh food, and thousands of homes were without power, including in Ingham and the Indigenous community of Palm Island.
And there is a warning for locals to watch for crocodiles lurking in floodwaters away from their usual habitats.
Sitting in the tropics, north Queensland is prone to destructive cyclones, storms and flooding.
But climate scientists say that warmer oceans and a hotter planet create the conditions for more intense and frequent extreme rainfall events.

Headline: Australian police find explosives for possible antisemitic attack

Text: Authorities in Sydney are investigating whether explosives discovered in a caravan were intended for an antisemitic attack.
The explosives could have caused a 40m-wide blast and "significant damage," police said on Wednesday, adding that the threat was contained.
A note was found in the caravan that displayed antisemitic messages, investigators said.
"This is the discovery of a potential mass casualty event," New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said.
New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner David Hudson told a news conference that the caravan was discovered on 19 January in Dural, a suburb of north-west Sydney.
The investigation became public on Wednesday after details of it were leaked to the media.
There was "some indication that the explosives might be used in some form of antisemitic attack," Mr Hudson said, but he wouldn't be drawn on the possible target.
He said officers had "mitigated the risk as much as possible" but stressed: "I'm not saying it's been eliminated. I'm saying it's been mitigated."
"That's one of the reasons we're talking today, for members of the public to be vigilant in relation to what they see and what they hear in relation to antisemitism in our community."
An investigation involving the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has been launched.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told ABC Radio Sydney the threat was "clearly designed to harm people" and "create fear in the community".
He said he agreed with Premier Chris Minns in describing it as "terrorism".
It has not yet been designated as terrorism by NSW Police.
Earlier, Albanese said that New South Wales Police had "people in custody" and was working with the AFP taskforce investigating antisemitic crimes called Special Operation Avalite.
Minns said the threat would be "met with the full resources of the government".
The discovery follows a spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia in recent months.
On Thursday, police said a Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs had been vandalised with antisemitic graffiti.
In December, worshippers were forced to flee as Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue was set on fire.
Earlier this month, a childcare centre in Sydney was set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages.

Text: Australia batter Steve Smith passed the 10,000-run mark in Test cricket as he scored a century on the first day of his side's opening match in Sri Lanka.
The 35-year-old went into the first Test of the two-match series on 9,999 runs and, as captain in the absence of Pat Cummins, chose to bat after winning the toss.
He came to the crease after Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne had been dismissed and nudged his first delivery to mid-on for a single to become the 15th batter to reach 10,000 Test runs.
"Fortunately hit that one in the gap so nice to get that one away," Smith told Australia's 7Cricket.
"Nice to tick that off," he added.
Smith went on to score 104 not out as he helped his side reach 330-2 at the close of play in Galle.
He is the fourth Australian to reach the 10,000 Test run landmark after Allan Border, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting.
Smith missed a year from the game when he was banned for 12 months after being part of the sandpaper ball-tampering scandal in a 2018 Test match against South Africa.
India's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test runs on 15,921, with Ponting second with 13,378.
England's Joe Root is fifth on the list with 12,972 runs after he passed compatriot Alastair Cook, who is sixth on 12,472.

Headline: Australian sect members guilty of causing girl's death

Published Date: 2025-01-29T05:57:03.147Z
Text: Fourteen members of an Australian religious group have been convicted of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl who was denied insulin for almost a week.
Elizabeth Struhs died at home in 2022 from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes.
The court heard that Elizabeth's treatment was withheld because the group, known as the Saints, opposed medical care, believing God would heal her.
Her father Jason Struhs and the group's leader Brendan Stevens were on trial for murder but convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Twelve other members, including Elizabeth's mother and brother, were also convicted of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty.
When handing down his almost 500-page verdict on Wednesday, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and "every member of the church including all other accused" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death.
"It cannot be doubted that Elizabeth was lovingly cared for in almost every way," he said.
"However, due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."
The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and have roughly two dozen members from three families.
The judge-alone trial in the Supreme Court of Queensland began in July last year and lasted several months.
Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an "intelligent" child who suffered greatly in her final days.
"She was described as speaking little, needing help going to the toilet, and being incontinent," prosecutor Caroline Marco said, adding that the girl would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness.
The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for Elizabeth, whose health deteriorated as she lay on a mattress at her home in Toowoomba, about 125km (78 miles) west of Brisbane.
No effort was made to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, as the group believed she could be brought back to life, the court heard.
The 14 defendants, aged between 22 and 67, represented themselves at trial, having all refused legal representation or to enter pleas. The court was required to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf.
Most had been charged because they had either counselled or aided her father in his decision to withhold Elizabeth's insulin, the court heard.
Prosecutors said that Jason Struhs, 53, had converted to the church much later than his wife Kerrie Struhs, 49, and that he had previously supported giving Elizabeth medicine.
They argued he changed his mind after being baptised into the group and that ultimately he knew the decision would end his daughter's life.
Speaking through tears when it was his turn to take the stand at trial, Jason Struhs said that he and Elizabeth had agreed to "stop the insulin" together, and that he still believed his daughter would be resurrected.
"Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again," he told the court.
Stevens, 63, defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of "religious persecution".
He said that the group was within its "rights to believe in the word of God completely" and that their decision not to enter pleas was because the congregation had "no intention of fighting" the case by using law.
Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs told the trial she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them.
She and other witnesses described the congregation as having increasingly strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were "pagan" or ungodly festivals.
The court also heard that Elizabeth's life had been in danger in 2019 when she was admitted to hospital in a diabetic coma weighing just 15kg (2st 5lb), after having become too weak to walk.
She was then diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections.
Both parents were charged over that incident - however Jason Struhs testified against his wife and received a more lenient sentence.
At the time, he said his wife - who had been a member of the Saints for years - did not believe in providing their kids with medical treatment for religious reasons. He also openly expressed regret for having "let his daughter down".
The court heard he later helped provide her with insulin for a period while his wife was in jail, but that he then faced pressure from other members of the religious group to stop doing so.
Giving his verdict, Justice Burns said that Jason Struhs and Stevens couldn't be convicted of murder because prosecutors had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the pair had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Elizabeth.
But all 14 defendants were guilty of manslaughter, he ruled, because they were jointly involved in a crime that resulted in her death.
Jayde Struhs said that while she was pleased with the verdict, the "system had failed" her sister.
"We are only here today because more wasn't done sooner to protect her or remove her from an incredibly unsafe situation in her own home," she said in a statement outside court.
The group is expected to be sentenced next month.
Toowoomba has long had a "colourful array of sectarian Christian groups and independent churches of various kinds", says Bernard Doherty, who studies new religious movements.
"The Saints appear to be one of these small independent churches which form around a few families," he told the BBC, adding that little is known about the close-knit congregation.
Jayde Struhs said the Saints had attended the Revival Centres International church in Brisbane, but they broke away after Stevens failed to become a pastor there. They then formed their own parish and held sermons at his house multiple times a week, she said.

Text: Almost 20,000 people have visited Sydney's Botanic Gardens to catch a whiff of an endangered plant known as the "corpse flower" as it bloomed.
Dubbed Putricia, the titan arum plant emits a putrid smell likened to "something rotting" or "hot garbage" for 24 hours after blooming.
The smell is the result of a chemical production that happens in the plant to attract pollinators.
The endangered flower - native to Sumatra, Indonesia - only blooms every 7-10 years in the wild. There are thought to be fewer than 1,000 plants globally, including those in cultivation.

Headline: Captain Cook statue vandalised ahead of Australia Day

Text: Australian police are investigating after a statue of Captain James Cook was covered in red paint and disfigured, ahead of the Australia Day weekend.
It is the second time in 12 months that the statue in Sydney has been vandalised.
Australia Day is a national holiday that is held each year on 26 January - the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet landing at Sydney Cove in 1788. Many Indigenous Australians say the date causes them pain.
The local council in Randwick - the suburb where the statue is located - described the vandalism as "a disservice to the community and a disservice to reconciliation".
Councillor Carolyn Martin told Sydney radio station 2GB that the vandals had knocked off one hand and parts of the face and nose.
The statue - which was first unveiled in 1874 - was previously targeted in February last year, when it was covered with red paint and had parts of its sandstone damaged. Works to repair and restore it were completed a month later.
There are several Captain Cook statues across Australia, and others have also been vandalised on or around 26 January.
In 2024, one in Melbourne was cut down on the eve of the holiday, while its plinth was spray-painted with the words "the colony will fall". Two years earlier the same statue had been splashed with red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words "no pride" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it.
Cook charted Australia's east coast in 1770, laying the groundwork for the later decision to send the First Fleet, which was led by Captain Arthur Phillip.
Australia Day is a contentious holiday for some, particularly among those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who view it as a reminder of the dispossession and displacement of their people.
To many Australians though, it is celebrated as a day of nation-building and achievement. Polling suggests a majority of people are supportive of keeping the holiday, despite suggestions it should be changed to a different date.

Text: An endangered plant known as the "corpse flower" for its putrid stink is blooming in Australia - and captivating the internet in the process, with thousands already tuned in to a livestream to witness its grand debut.
The titan arum plant, housed in the Royal Botanic Gardens of Sydney, blooms only once every few years for just 24 hours.
Affectionately dubbed Putricia, it will release a smell described as "wet socks, hot cat food, or rotting possum flesh".
The long wait to see Putricia fully unfurl has spawned jokes and even a unique lingo in the livestream's chat, with thousands commenting "WWTF", or "We Watch the Flower".
The livestream attracted more than 8,000 simultaneous viewers on Thursday, doubling within hours as the plant's appearance slowly changed.
John Siemon, director of horticulture and living collections at the gardens, compared the spectacle to Sydney's 2000 Olympics, saying "we've had 15,000 people come through the gates before it [the flower] even opened".
"This specimen is around 10 years old. We acquired it from our colleagues in LA Botanic Garden at the age of three, and we've been nurturing it for the last seven years," he told the BBC's Newsday programme.
"[We're] incredibly excited to have our first bloom in 15 years."
After days of inaction, the view on the livestream markedly changed on Thursday as Putricia, comfortably ensconced behind a red velvet rope, began to open up.
As she continues to bloom, viewers can expect to see Putricia unfold a vibrant maroon or crimson skirt, known as a spathe, around her spadix which is the large spike in the middle of the plant.
The gardens has said it is "hard to predict exactly when" Putricia will bloom, but that has not stopped the thousands gathered online.
"I'm back again to see how Putricia is going and I can see she's still taking her time like the queen she is, fair play," wrote one commenter. "This is the slowest burlesque ever," said another.
Yet another person wrote: "Overnight I watched, fell asleep, awoke, watched, fell asleep. I am weak, but Putricia is strong. WWTF."
Other popular acronyms among viewers are WDNRP (We Do Not Rush Putricia) and BBTB (Blessed Be The Bloom).
The plant can only be found in the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia, where it is known as bunga bangkai - or "corpse flower" in Indonesian. Its scientific name is Amorphophallus titanum, which is derived from Ancient Greek and means "giant misshapen penis".
When in bloom, the plant's long yellow spadix emits a strong odour, often compared to the smell of decaying flesh, to trick pollinators into landing on what they think is rotten meat so they can move pollen between male and female specimens.
It has the world's largest flowering structure, as it can grow up to 3m (10 feet) tall and weigh up to 150kg. The plant contains several hundred flowers in the base of its spadix.
It is endangered in the wild due to deforestation and land degradation.
Putricia is one of several titan arums in Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens, which last saw one bloom 15 years ago.
But there have been other corpse flower blooms across Australia in recent years, including Melbourne and Adelaide's botanic gardens, each time attracting thousands of curious visitors keen on having a whiff.
There are also a few housed in Kew Gardens in London, where one bloomed in June last year. The titan arum first flowered outside of Sumatra in 1889 in Kew.

Text: A cat has made three flights between New Zealand and Australia in just 24 hours after being forgotten on a plane.
Mittens, an eight-year-old Maine Coon, was booked to travel from Christchurch to Melbourne on 12 January - but her cage was left in the Air New Zealand aircraft's cargo hold.
After waiting for three hours for Mittens at Melbourne airport, owner Margo Neas was told by ground staff the plane had already returned to New Zealand with her pet.
During that flight the heating was turned on to keep the cat comfortable, Ms Neas said. The pet - who had lost weight but was otherwise unharmed - was later flown again to Melbourne to reunite with her owner.
Speaking to NBC on Wednesday, Ms Neas said she and her son had been informed about the mishap by airport ground staff in Melbourne.
"They said: 'Look, we have located your cat - but it's actually on the return flight to Christchurch...'
"And I said: 'When did you discover that the cat wasn't taken off the plane?' And they said: 'We've only just discovered now.' And I said: 'How can this happen?'"
Ms Neas said she was told that the pilot had already been alerted to turn the heating on in the cargo hold where the temperature could be as low as 7C.
Air New Zealand is still looking into how Mittens was forgotten, but reports say a stowed wheelchair may have obscured a baggage handler's view of her cage.
The airline has apologised for the distress caused and promised to reimburse all travel costs.
The company does not accept direct animal bookings from the public for international flights, so passengers must book via approved pet carrier firms.
Ms Neas said she had been relieved to be finally reunited with Mittens.
"She basically just ran into my arms and just snuggled up in here and just did the biggest cuddles of all time," she was quoted as saying by the AP news agency on Wednesday. "It was just such a relief."
Ms Neas, who had earlier decided to relocate to Australia, added: "It was not a great start to our new life in Melbourne because we didn't have the family, we weren't complete."
The one-way flight time between Christchurch and Melbourne usually takes less than four hours.

Text: Australia's federal police have said they are investigating whether "overseas actors or individuals" are paying local criminals to carry out antisemitic crimes in the country.
There has been a spate of such incidents in recent months, the latest of which saw a childcare centre in Sydney set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti. No-one was injured.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called a snap cabinet meeting in response, where officials agreed to set up a national database to track antisemitic incidents.
Thus far, the federal police taskforce, set up in December to investigate such incidents, received more than 166 reports of antisemitic crimes.
Albanese said it appeared some of the crimes were "being perpetrated by people who don't have a particular issue, aren't motivated by an ideology, but are paid actors".
"Now, it's unclear who or where the payments are coming from," he told reporters on Wednesday.
Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said it was possible that cryptocurrencies - which can take longer to identify - had been used.
He added that police were also investigating whether young people were carrying out these crimes and whether they had been radicalised online.
However, Mr Kershaw cautioned, "intelligence is not the same as evidence" and more charges were expected soon.
Last week, a man from Sydney became the first person to be charged by the federal taskforce, dubbed Special Operation Avalite, over alleged death threats he made towards a Jewish organisation.
Albanese said Tuesday's incident at a childcare centre in the eastern Sydney suburb of Maroubra was "as cowardly as it is disgusting" and described it as a "hate crime".
"This was an attack targeted at the Jewish community. And it is a crime that concerns us all because it is also an attack on the nation and society we have built together," he wrote on social media.
Israel's deputy foreign minister told the ABC that Australia's government had been "inflaming" problems in the local community by not clamping down harder on antisemitic crimes.
But Albanese on Wednesday said his government had "acted from day one" to protect Australia's Jewish community, and criticised those seeking to make it a "political issue".
The Jewish Council of Australia, which was set up last year in opposition to antisemitism, said that it "strongly condemns" this and all such incidents.
"These acts underscore the urgent need for cooperation, education and community dialogue to combat prejudice and promote understanding," it said in a statement.
Most of the recent incidents have taken place in Sydney and have involved antisemitic graffiti, arson and vandalism of buildings including synagogues.
New South Wales has set up its own state-level taskforce to address these incidents and more than 35 people have been charged so far with antisemitism-related offences. These include a 33-year-old man who was charged on Wednesday over an attempt to set fire to a synagogue earlier this month.
A further 70 arrests have been made for similar crimes in the neighbouring state of Victoria, where a synagogue was set on fire last month.
On Wednesday, police said they had charged a 33-year-old Sydney man over the

Text: The mysterious balls that forced the closure of several beaches in Sydney last week were found to contain saturated fatty acids, E. coli and faecal bacteria, authorities say.
Sydney's Northern Beaches council said it has sent the debris to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) for further analysis.
Nine beaches, including popular spots Manly and Dee Why, were closed on 14 January after the marble-sized balls started washing up.
It came months after thousands of black blobs started appearing on the city's coasts in October, prompting authorities to close some of its most famous beaches for several days and order a massive clean-up.
The latest batch of balls was cleaned up from harbour beaches this week, the Northern Beaches council said in its statement on Tuesday.
It urged anyone who spotted the balls not to handle them and to contact authorities.
Besides the acids and bacteria, the balls also contained volcanic rock pumice.
Northern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said she hopes the EPA analysis will "identify the source so that they can stop this from happening at other beaches".
"We are continuing to conduct regular inspections of our beaches and encourage the community to report any sightings," she said.
The first batch of debris in October were at first mistakenly called "tar balls" but were later found to contain everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs.
Scientists said they resembled fat, oil and grease blobs - often called "fatbergs" - which are commonly formed in sewage systems.
But Sydney Water has reported that its water treatment plants are operating normally and that there were no known issues with waste systems in the city.

Text: An Australian influencer has been charged with poisoning her baby girl to elicit donations and boost online followers.
The Queensland woman claimed she was chronicling her child's battle with a terminal illness on social media, but detectives allege she was drugging the one-year-old and then filming her in "immense distress and pain".
Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode.
After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud.
"[There are] no words for how repulsive offences of this nature are," Queensland Police Det Insp Paul Dalton told reporters on Thursday.
Between August and October, detectives say that the woman - from the Sunshine Coast region - gave the child several prescription and pharmacy medicines, without approval.
She went to great lengths to obtain the unauthorised medications and cover up her behaviour, they alleged, including using leftover medicine for a different person in their house.
Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing "severe emotional and physical distress and harm". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said.
However, Insp Dalton said the child was now "safe and doing well".
The woman raised A$60,000 (£30,500; $37,300) through GoFundMe donations - which the site is attempting to repay, Det Insp Dalton said.
Police had investigated other people over the alleged abuse, but there was no evidence to charge anyone else, he added.
The woman is due to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday.

Text: Months after mysterious black balls forced the closure of some of Sydney's most famous beaches, small marble-like debris has begun washing up on the city's shores again.
The balls - this time grey or white in colour - have prompted councils to shut nine beaches, including popular Manly and Dee Why, while authorities investigate.
Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days in October and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of black deposits started appearing on the coast.
Testing by authorities determined those balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill.
Northern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said the latest balls "could be anything", according to the Guardian Australia.
"We don't know at the moment what it is and that makes it even more concerning," she said.
"There's something that's obviously leaking or dropping... floating out there and being tossed around."
In a post on Facebook on Tuesday, the Northern Beaches Council said they were alerted to the fresh debris by the New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The agency and the council planned to collect the discoveries for testing and inspect other beaches in the area too.
Anyone who spotted the balls was urged to contact authorities, the council added.
Though widely reported to be "tar balls", the debris in October was later found to contain everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs.
Scientists said they resembled fat, oil, and grease blobs - often called fatbergs - which are commonly formed in sewerage systems.
However Sydney Water reported there were no known issues with waste systems in the city, and authorities still don't know the source of the material, prompting some to express concerns about the safety of the city's beaches.
"The EPA can't explain the source of the human waste causing the fatbergs and it can't assure the public that Sydney's beaches are safe to use," state politician Sue Higginson, from the Greens party, said in a statement in December.

Headline: Bride's fury after Instagram stunt wedding turns out to be real

Text: A woman in Australia has annulled her marriage after realising that a fake wedding ceremony she took part in for a social media stunt was in fact real.
The unknowing bride said her partner was a social media influencer who convinced her to take part in the ceremony as a "prank" for his Instagram account.
She only discovered the marriage was genuine when he tried to use it to gain permanent residency in Australia.
A Melbourne judge granted the annulment after accepting the woman was tricked into getting married, in a judgement published on Thursday.
The bizarre case began in September 2023 when the woman met her partner on an online dating platform. They began seeing each other regularly in Melbourne, where they lived at the time.
In December that year, the man proposed to the woman and she accepted.
Two days later, the woman attended an event with the man in Sydney. She was told it would be a "white party" - where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing - and was told to pack a white dress.
But when they arrived she was "shocked" and "furious" to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographer's friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents.
"So when I got there, and I didn't see anybody in white, I asked him, 'What's happening?'. And he pulled me aside, and he told me that he's organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page," she said.
She said she had accepted his explanation as "he was a social media person" who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court.
Still, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend "laughed it off" and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not.
Reassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to "play along" to "make it look real".
Two months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners.
When she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the woman's testimony.
The woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip - before they even got engaged - which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the woman's.
"I'm furious with the fact that I didn't know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application," she said.
In his deposition, the man claimed they had "both agreed to these circumstances" and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an "intimate ceremony" in Sydney.
The judge ruled that the woman was "mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed" and "did not provide real consent to her participation" in the marriage.
"She believed she was acting. She called the event 'a prank'. It made perfect sense for her to adopt the persona of a bride in all things at the impugned ceremony so as to enhance the credibility of the video depicting a legally valid marriage," he stated in the judgement.
The marriage was annulled in October 2024.

Connolly, 21, has played two one-day internationals and two T20s for Australia and is yet to take a wicket in either format.
He joins Nathan Lyon, Matt Kuhnemann and Todd Murphy in the spin attack, while Mitchell Starc, Scott Boland and Sean Abbott are the frontline seamers.
All-rounder Mitchell Marsh has also been omitted after a poor series against India while Beau Webster, who replaced him in the final Test at Sydney, keeps his spot.
The first Test takes place on 29 January in Galle.

Headline: How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war
Author: Tiffanie Turnbull, BBC News, Sydney
Published Date: 2025-01-08T16:23:13.028Z
Text: For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches.
Swallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze, is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia.
"It's chockers [crowded]. They're all over the place," Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC.
For her – and most Australians – cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity trying to find a parking space. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach.
Polyester covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them.
"The sheer amount of space that people are taking up… [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating," Claire says.
She's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette.
A row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and even dragged in the prime minister.
Self-described haters say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers.
"When you're… polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle [Gay Uncle] Nic going to go," anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project.
"I just want my space on the beach, guys."
But the pro-cabana mob say seeking protection from Australia's vicious sun isn't a crime - and it's every man for himself.
Australia is the skin cancer capital of the world, and many supporters – including national charity, the Cancer Council – argue the new trend should actually be celebrated.
"My partner and I have a cool cabana because we both burn extremely easily and we don't want to die of skin cancer by 30, hope this helps," one person wrote, responding to a TikTok rant.
No one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents.
Half the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun cream and a hat will do just fine.
Other cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing "the prime piece of real estate" on busy beaches.
She is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day.
"There's a lot of research that goes into this. You get up early, you've got to watch the tides. You can't just plonk it there and walk away… you invest in it," Smith argued on Nine's Today programme.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the hordes irked by the trend: "That's not on," he told the same show.
"One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach. Here, everyone owns the beach… And that's a breach of that principle, really."
Even lifeguards have opinions on the matter, with some telling local media the cabana camps can make it hard for them to do their jobs.
There are a number of cultural quirks which mean Cabanagate has Australians more worked up than a magpie in spring.
Firstly, the country loves to think of itself as an egalitarian society – the land of a "fair go" – and that extends to the use of one of its most precious national assets.
"Australian beaches, they always have been seen as shared spaces, democratic spaces where social hierarchies dissolve…. [they're] seen as a great equaliser," says Ece Kaya, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney.
And Australians are "fiercely" protective of that ideal: "They see it as a birthright," says Chris Pepin-Neff, who studies Australian beach culture.
They point to the backlash in 1929 when beachgoers at Sydney's Coogee Beach were forced to pay for access to the only part of the water covered by shark nets. More recently, a bid to rent out part of Sydney's famous Bondi Beach to an exclusive beach club was met with a huge outcry.
And while the use of sprawling cabanas is a relatively new phenomenon, there's long been "enormous class tension" around the use of the country's coastline, Dr Pepin-Neff adds.
A lack of infrastructure, affordable housing and community attitudes tend to lock ordinary Australians out of waterfront areas, while those natural assets are often monopolised by those lucky enough to live there.
"And there's a perception that it's encroaching even further, [so] that an average family can't even get a spot at the beach."
But they say there's no real data on who is using cabanas and why. They also argue there's many good reasons people might use them. Maybe they've travelled a long way so they plan to stay at the beach longer, or they may have a disability or young children they need to cater for, he says.
"There is a balance between a free and open beach that everybody can use, and making sure that you're respectful."
They offer no defence for the "land bankers" though: "As a Sydneysider, I think that is abusing the privilege… that is not a fair go."
As the debate intensifies though, there are some calls for a truce to restore the peace to Australian shores.
Beachkit Australia founder Rowan Clark, who sells equipment including cabanas, told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper even he thinks cabana lovers should be more courteous.
"They should only allow set up at the rear of the beach in a line," he said. "Once this is exhausted, then no more of this style of shade should be allowed."
Others want authorities to rein it in, like some have in the United States. There are suggestions councils could limit how many cabanas can be set up on their beaches, and where.
But Sydney resident Claire, for all her wrath, worries that this could tip the scales in the other direction and exclude other people from using the beach.
"You don't want to get too precious about it, obviously… it's just the beach, first world problems right?
"I think in general, we should just try to be considerate of one another."

Text: A hiker who went missing for nearly two weeks in New South Wales, Australia has been found alive, having survived on foraged berries and two muesli bars.
Medical student Hadi Nazari went missing on Boxing Day after he wandered off to take photos during a hike with his friends in Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains region.
Hundreds of people, including Mr Nazari's friends and family, joined search efforts to locate the 23-year-old.
He was found by other hikers around 15:15 local time (04:15 GMT) on Wednesday.
Mr Nazari had called out to the hikers and "told them that he'd been lost in the bush and was thirsty", Superintendent Andrew Spliet told reporters.
After the hikers contacted emergency services, Mr Nazari was winched over to the search command post by a helicopter. He was assessed by paramedics at the scene and conveyed to a hospital.
Mr Spliet said that Mr Nazari was found in good health - alert, able to speak and had no significant injuries.
The two muesli bars, which Mr Nazari had found in a hut in the mountains, was "pretty much all that he's had to consume over the last two weeks", said Mr Spliet, adding that the hiker had also found water from creeks and foraged for berries.
Mr Nazari's family, who were seen hugging him at the search base camp on Wednesday, later confirmed to local media that he was fine. "It is the happiest day of our lives," they told 9News.
Mr Nazari was found near Blue Lake, around 10km (6 miles) away from the campground where he was supposed to meet his friends on 26 December.
"He's covered a lot of ground in that time," said Spliet, adding that police would "catch up with him" after he is checked out of hospital.

Headline: To conserve or cull? Life in Australia's crocodile capital

Text: It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.
Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent – that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.
"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys," says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.
We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.
The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.
And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.
Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.
After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.
But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.
They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.
The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.
"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles]," explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.
"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem."
The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.
There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.
While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.
Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.
Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.
This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues.
Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.
His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.
The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.
The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.
"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can," says Ewin, who's been doing his "dream job" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.
"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people."
Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.
The NT government goes into schools with its programme "Be Crocwise" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.
It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.
"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.
"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do."
In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.
Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.
This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.
Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.
In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.
Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.
It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.
Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.
The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT – for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.
Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch "croc jumping" - which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.
"I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on," jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat.
"The bit I don't have to tell you… [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here."
For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them.
"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so," he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.
Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.
It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.
Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; £398,000) - have all invested in the industry.
"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife," says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.
His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.
Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.
One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.
For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.
"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time," the Balngarra man says.
"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles."
But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.
The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.
Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.
Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.
But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.
"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed," says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.
"The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart," he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs.
He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.
"We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator…and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them.
"You try and get people in Sydney or London or New York to put up with a serious predator - they aren't going to do it."

Headline: The making of Konstas - Australia's new batting star

Text: Sam Konstas first revealed his plan to ramp Jasprit Bumrah over a pre-match meal late on Christmas Day.
"We had dinner the night before the game and he said he would do it on 150 if he got there," his batting coach Tahmid Islam tells BBC Sport.
Fast forward a few hours and debutant Konstas, Australia's new 19-year-old batting sensation, was doing so on Boxing Day in front of 90,000 people at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Only, he had not waited until his 150th run, and not even his 150th ball.
"Initially I thought I might be out of a job as batting coach when he missed the first couple," Islam says.
Konstas may have failed with those first two scoops, but he tried again soon after and hit Bumrah - the world's top-ranked bowler - for a six and two fours on the way to 60 from 65 balls.
Those shots marked one of the most remarkable starts to a Test career in recent memory – cult hero status gained in a matter of minutes by a batter long tipped for the top.
Because, while Konstas' emergence at the highest level was explosive, the journey to get there has been long.
He was the Sydney suburb kid of Greek heritage who was scoring hundreds before his age had reached double figures.
In October he became the youngest player since the great Ricky Ponting to score centuries in each innings of a match in the Sheffield Shield, Australia's first-class competition.
Two years before that, and just a month after his 17th birthday, Konstas became the youngest batter to score a century for Sutherland in the top tier of Sydney's notoriously tough grade cricket.
The previous holder of that record? A certain Steve Smith.
"I remember not being too surprised it was him that did it," says Sutherland captain Tom Doyle.
The talent has always been there, those scoop shots too.
"We had a T20 game and he had come off a hundred in the U21s game in the morning," says Doyle, remembering another innings by Konstas while still aged 17.
"I remember him getting sledged by the opposition and he preceded to ramp like he did for Australia against some pretty intimidating first grade bowlers."
A host of internationals have passed through the club's pavilion - Smith, Shane Watson, West Indies legend Andy Roberts and Glenn McGrath to name a few.
Konstas joined as a 17-year-old in 2022 from St George's - the club where the great Sir Don Bradman once played - in a switch that made the newspapers, such was the noise around him.
"It is hard to compare," Doyle says. "From a talent level, Sam is no doubt on par.
"He is on this upwards curve where he keeps getting better and better each time he plays."
Those that know Konstas describe him as polite and a hard worker.
During his time at Cranbrook School, then in his early teens, he first met Islam - a former first-class cricketer and a batting consultant in the school's cricket set-up.
He and Islam speak every day, practising together numerous times per week, while Watson, the all-rounder who played 307 times for Australia, has become a mentor working on Konstas' mental approach.
"The one that really sticks out was when I was at the rugby grand final and Sammy kept calling me," Islam says.
"He wasn't quite happy with how he had batted in his club session, had a game the next day and wanted a net session at 6am before his game.
"I remember thinking I have never seen anyone have that desire and hunger to make sure he has ticked every box to give himself the best chance.
"He hit for about an hour and a half and got 205 in that game."
While Konstas' first innings in international cricket had all of the shots of a Bazballer, scoring big hundreds is how he made his name.
"Looking back on a lot of Sam's innings, he doesn't play every day of cricket the same," says Sutherland's Doyle.
"He is a multi-dimensional cricketer. The way he played in a lot of his first grade innings is more traditional, with a spark of flair here and there."
The other thing people mention when talking about Konstas is confidence.
The confidence to ramp Bumrah, the confidence to not be put off by a shoulder barge by Virat Kohli, the confidence to point to the name on the back of his shirt when reaching 50 and wave his arm to ramp up the capacity Boxing Day crowd.
England might well be taking notes, with the Ashes coming up towards the end of 2025 down under.
"There can be a blurred line between arrogance and confidence," Doyle says.
"Sam has, through a lot of hard work and persistence, developed a level of confidence to score runs in a way that works for him.
"You see him revving up the crowds. We don't have crowds at grade cricket but that is his personality coming out. He is an energised, enthusiastic and eager cricketer.
"Him being that person for the crowd is just his personality coming out."
That confidence will, of course, be tested as his international career continues.
The second-innings effort was more difficult for Konstas, as he reached only eight before Bumrah gained some revenge with an inswinger that hit middle stump having gone through the gate.
"He has always had this desire and hunger to get it right and to continue to develop his game," Islam says of Konstas.
"At the start of every season we write down a few goals and plans for the season coming up and playing Test cricket certainly wasn't part of that."
Those goals may have changed after Konstas' week in the spotlight. He will hope the run-scoring does not.

Headline: Chlamydia could make koalas extinct. Can a vaccine save them in time?
Author: Tiffanie Turnbull, BBC News, Gold Coast

Text: On the table, unconscious and stretched out on a pillow, Joe Mangy looks deceptively peaceful. The koala's watery, red-rimmed eyes are the only sign of the disease at war with his body.
Tubes snarl out of a mask covering his face as a vet tech listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is not healing as well as they had hoped.
Eight days earlier, Joe Mangy – who is about two years old – was found wandering in the middle of a suburban road. Dazed and confused, eyes nearly glued shut with mucus, he was rushed here, to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary's hospital.
Enveloped by rainforest on Queensland's Gold Coast, the park is full of koalas like this.
Outside the clinic, in a "Koala Rehab Centre" faintly perfumed by eucalyptus leaves, is a three-year-old recovering from a hysterectomy. "It saved her life… but she can't reproduce," the head vet Michael Pyne says.
Another male koala stares blankly through narrowed slits. His left tear duct is so inflamed his eyeball is barely visible.
This hospital is ground zero of a grim chlamydia epidemic which is killing thousands of koalas and making even more sterile, pushing the national icons to the brink of extinction.
But it's also at the core of desperate bid to save them with a vaccine – frustrated efforts which, after over a decade, are still tied up in regulation and running out of both time and money.
Even a few decades ago, spotting a koala snuggled in a backyard tree was nothing out of the ordinary. They were plentiful on the country's populous east coast.
But in recent times the species has been in dramatic decline – in some places plummeting by 80% in just 10 years.
Land clearing and urbanisation are leaving the marsupials hungry and homeless, while natural disasters are drowning or cooking them en masse.
"[But] it's the chlamydia that shot up tremendously - almost exponentially," says Dr Pyne, who has run the Currumbin clinic for more than 20 years.
"You get days where you're euthanising heaps of koalas that just come in completely ravaged."
Estimates vary greatly – koalas are famously difficult to count – but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered on most of the eastern seaboard. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation.
Dr Pyne wistfully recounts "the early days" when his hospital only saw a handful of koalas a year.
They now see 400.
So many come through the door that the team has started giving them two names, a vet nurse says, cradling Joe Mangy as he wakes from the anaesthetic. His last name is a nod to the state of his eyes when he first arrived, she explains.
Of the top reasons koalas are brought into wildlife hospitals – vehicle strikes, pet attacks and chlamydia – the bacterial infection is the biggest and deadliest.
It results in conjunctivitis for koalas like Joe Mangy, but presents as an infection of the genitals and urinary system for others. Particularly unlucky animals, get both at the same time.
At its worst, the ocular form can be so bad koalas are blinded and starve to death, while the urogenital infection produces giant fluid-filled cysts so "nasty" everyday bodily functions like passing urine make the animals cry out in pain.
"Their reproductive system falls apart," Dr Pyne explains.
If caught early enough, treatment is an option, but that in itself is a potentially fatal "nightmare" as the antibiotics destroy the gut bacteria which allow koalas to digest otherwise toxic eucalyptus leaves – their main food source.
On a species level though, the disease, which spreads through bodily fluids, causes even greater ruin.
Chlamydia is not uncommon in other animals – koalas are suspected to have first caught it from livestock – but the spread and intensity of the disease amongst the marsupials is unmatched.
Experts estimate around half of koalas in Queensland and New South Wales could be infected, but just a suburb away from Currumbin, in Elanora, that has climbed beyond 80%.
It is the most diseased population in the region and numbers have been "falling off a cliff", Dr Pyne says. "It's a disaster."
Enter the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and their vaccine, which aims to prevent and treat chlamydia in koalas and has been almost two decades in the making.
Alongside Currumbin, they're trying to save the Elanora koalas from oblivion: capturing 30 youngsters and vaccinating them, before recatching them at intervals over three years to track their health.
So far only three of the vaccinated koalas in this research trial have contracted the disease, though all recovered, and encouragingly, more than two dozen joeys have been born - bucking the infertility trend.
"There's generations of koalas now that have come through. We've got grand joeys," Dr Pyne says excitedly.
Currumbin has also been vaccinating every koala which comes through their hospital, and have reached about 400 koalas this way.
But treating and vaccinating each koala with chlamydia costs them about A$7,000 (£3,500, $4,500). Capturing, jabbing, and tracking each wild Elanora koala is basically double that.
Two hours away, researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) are doing their best to flatten the wave of disease too, with a separate vaccine.
They inoculate about 2,000 koalas a year through wildlife hospital trials and tack themselves onto development projects or research studies in the region that involve their capture.
They've just wrapped a decade's-worth of those projects into one study of more than 600 animals – the largest and longest of its kind.
Incredibly, deaths dropped by two thirds among vaccinated koalas.
Molecular biologist Samuel Phillips tells the BBC about one local koala population they studied which was at risk of extinction. Authorities are now looking at translocating some animals so they don't overpopulate the area.
"It turned it around completely."
And crucially, the study found that the koalas that did contract chlamydia were doing so later in life, after their peak breeding years had begun.
Dr Phillips and his research partner Peter Timms have now submitted their vaccine to the federal regulator for approval but say they're keeping their hopes in check.
"There'll be hurdles," Dr Timms explains.
In the meantime, for their small, overstretched team, dividing time and funding is an impossible balance. Do they involve themselves in as many trials as possible to help small groups of koalas now, or do they devote their efforts to advancing the tedious research and approval process which could help a huge cohort of them down the track?
"People come to us semi-regularly and say, 'Can we vaccinate more koalas?' And the answer at some point is 'No', because otherwise we're just spending all our time and energy doing [that]," Dr Timms says.
It has now been a decade since these two research teams first started seeing results, and there is still no real timeline on when a jab will be ready.
And even when it is, there are huge barriers to any roll out.
While making the vaccine isn't that costly, finding, capturing, and vaccinating wild koalas is extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming.
Dr Phillips says they would have to strategically target select populations, though they're not yet sure how many koalas in each they'd need to treat to reverse decline.
That challenge will be doubly complicated with the QUT vaccine, though, because it requires two doses, as opposed to UniSC's single-shot formula.
The QUT team has been developing an implant – inspired by a human contraceptive device – that dissolves after four weeks to provide the booster. It will be trialled on Currumbin's captive koalas next year.
Then there is the question of funding, which has been, and continues to be, fickle. Both vaccine developers provide their shots to wildlife hospitals and research trials for free, relying on individual donors, generosity from their universities, and the unpredictable whims of election cycles.
State and federal governments are the biggest financial backers of the vaccine projects – last year Canberra gave QUT and UniSC A$750,000 each.
"No-one wants to imagine an Australia without koalas," Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said at the time.
But government contributions are random, and never quite enough.
"I cannot believe somebody will not come along tomorrow and say 'You need to vaccinate? Here's my cheque to cover the next 10 years'. But we can't find them," Dr Timms says.
However, the biggest barrier is the mountain of red tape researchers are yet to cut through.
Both groups have conservation charities and wildlife hospitals knocking down the door, desperate for access, but until they go through the "painful" approval process, their hands are largely tied.
"[It's] a critical step that is just taking too long. It kills me," Dr Pyne says.
"We've kind of passed it being urgent. It was urgent probably 10 years ago."
Adding to their despondency, is a fact all involved stress repeatedly: the vaccine is simply not enough to save the species.
And so even the lucky koalas like Joe Mangy, who dodge death by chlamydia and return to the wild, still must face off against a myriad of other mortal threats.
"It's death by a thousand cuts, right?" Dr Timms says.

Text: A 40-year-old man has died after being attacked by a shark on the edge of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, local police said.
Luke Walford, a youth pastor, had been spearfishing with his family when he was bitten on Saturday afternoon.
He sustained "life-threatening injuries" and despite paramedics' efforts, he died at the scene about an hour later, authorities said.
He and his family had been in the water at Humpy Island, in the Great Barrier Reef's Keppel Bay Islands National Park, when the attack happened. The area is a popular spot for diving and snorkelling.
Walford had been a school chaplain and pastor at the Cathedral of Praise church in Rockhampton, Queensland.
Donna Kirkland, his local MP, said she was in shock, and that Walford was a friend to her and "countless others."
"My prayers and heartfelt condolences are with his beautiful family and indeed the many who will be devastated, as I am, at this news", she added.
A family friend told ABC News he had watched the rescue helicopter fly over his house, unaware it was for his friend.
"I always say a little tribute for whoever it may be, but to find out it was Luke was a very sad day," Doug Webber said.
Queensland police said a report would be prepared for the coroner.
Australia's last fatal shark attack happened in December 2023, when a teenage boy was killed in the south.
Just this year, there have been four other shark incidents in Australia, according to a local database.
In general, Australia sees more shark attacks than any other country except the US.

Text: Australian actress and comedian Rebel Wilson has married Ramona Agruma in Sydney, the star has announced on social media.
The couple held a wedding ceremony in Sardinia in September, and were subsequently formally married at the service in Sydney, which was officiated by Wilson's sister.
The actress proposed to Agruma, a fashion and jewellery designer, at Disneyland in 2023.
Among well-wishers commenting on social media were Pitch Perfect co-stars Adam Devine and Elizabeth Banks, who offered their congratulations to the couple.
Wilson, 44, said it felt "right" to get married in her hometown: "It meant my 94-year-old grandmother Gar could come, which was very special to us to have her included," she wrote on Instagram.
Agruma also shared photos from the day adding: "Married officially in Australia to my Australian princess."
The couple are pictured beaming with the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge serving as the backdrop.
The Bridesmaids actress announced the birth of her first child, via a surrogate in November 2022. Sharing a picture of daughter Royce Lilly, she described her as a "beautiful miracle".
The star made headlines earlier this year when the US version of her memoir, Rebel Rising, which delved into Wilson's sexuality, weight and fertility, was released, and made allegations against Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen.
The British edition of the book, published on 25 April, blacked out text believed to be relating to him.
A spokesman for Baron Cohen at the time said the redactions represented a "clear victory", and reiterated the actor's position that Wilson's claims were "demonstrably false".
In her memoir, Wilson also talked about being a "late bloomer" and losing her virginity at 35.

Text: Two people taking part in Australia's annual Sydney to Hobart yacht race have died in separate incidents, according to police.
Both crew members died in separate incidents after being hit by a boom - the large pole attached horizontally to the bottom of a sail.
The event's organisers said the incidents happened on the Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline.
The first boats are expected to arrive in the city of Hobart, in Tasmania, later on Friday or early on Saturday. Several have already retired due to bad weather.
New South Wales (NSW) police said the first incident was reported to officers just before midnight on Thursday local time (12:50 GMT) by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the country's capital, Canberra.
Just over two hours later, at 02:15 on Friday, NSW police were told that crew aboard the second boat were giving CPR to the second person, which also had not worked.
Flying Fish Arctos had been sailing approximately 30 nautical miles east/south-east of the NSW town of Ulladulla, the organisers said.
Bowline, meanwhile, was approximately 30 nautical miles east/north-east of the town of Batemans Bay, also in NSW.
"Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased," the organisers said in a statement.
"The Sydney to Hobart is an Australian tradition, and it is heart-breaking that two lives have been lost at what should be a time of joy," said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
The race, which began on Thursday, has continued.
It is not the first time there have been fatalities during the race, which was first held in 1945.
Six people, including British Olympic yachtsman Glyn Charles, died in 1998 after raging storms hit competitors.

Headline: Konstas, 19, to make Australia debut in Boxing Day Test

Published Date: 2024-12-24T09:08:29.489Z
Text: Opener Sam Konstas is set to become Australia men's youngest Test batting debutant in 71 years in the Boxing Day Test against India.
The 19-year-old was called up to replace Nathan McSweeney last week after he managed only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40.
The series is currently tied at 1-1 with two matches left to play.
"He's composed, relaxed, knows his game is in a good place at the moment, he'll play Boxing Day," said Australia coach Andrew McDonald.
"We're really excited for him, Boxing Day, the biggest stage. He might as well get that one out of the way early."
New South Wales' Konstas will be Australia's youngest batting debutant since Ian Craig in 1953.
Earlier this season Konstas scored two centuries against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, becoming the youngest player to do so since Ricky Ponting in 1993.
McDonald said he has been selected to take the game to India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with bowlers having had the upper hand in the series so far.
"We want to throw a different challenge at India at this point in time," said McDonald.
"We believe Nathan [McSweeney] is good enough for Test level. We weren't sure about how the top order was functioning. We challenged ourselves for that decision. Whether it works or not, time will tell (but) we're really confident that Sam can do the job."
McDonald was also "pretty confident" Travis Head would be fit to play despite a quad strain preventing him from training on Monday.
The 30-year-old left-hand batter has scored 409 runs including two centuries in the first three Tests,
McDonald also said that paceman Scott Boland would likely come in for the injured Josh Hazlewood, and confirmed all-rounder Mitchell Marsh was fit to play.
Skipper Pat Cummins is set to reveal the rest of the Australia line-up on Wednesday, with the match starting at 23:30 GMT.

Text: Residents in an Australian region engulfed by bushfires were given two hours to return home to collect their belongings before Christmas on Tuesday, as emergency crews try to contain the blaze.
Communities around the Grampians, in Victoria, have been evacuated amid warnings from authorities that conditions there in the days ahead could be the worst since Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called "Black Summer" of 2019-20.
The bushfires have already burnt over 41,000 hectares (101,000 acres) of land in the past week, however there have been no deaths or loss of property.
Intense heat forecast for Boxing Day has also prompted a string of fire warnings across the country.
Throughout Victoria, temperatures are expected to reach 40C (104F) and be accompanied by strong dry winds, while parts of South Australia and New South Wales could also face bushfire conditions on Thursday into Friday.
"We're expecting to see extreme fire danger across almost the entire state," Luke Hegarty, a spokesman for Victoria's State Control Centre, said.
"This is the most significant fire danger that the state has seen – across the whole sections of state that we're talking about – since Black Summer. It's important that people understand that Thursday is a day with serious potential," he added.
Four interstate firefighting forces and two incident management teams - made up of over 100 personnel - will land in Victoria in the coming days to provide reprieve for emergency crews that have been working around the clock to fight the current fires.
The decision to give families around the Grampians temporary access to their homes "to get Christmas items … presents and the like" on Tuesday morning was made by the state's Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer, Jason Heffernan.
"[This is] to ensure if the residents of Halls Gap will be relocated for Christmas, at least they will have what they need," he told Seven's Sunrise programme.
Mary Ann Brown, who lives on the southern edge of the Grampians National Park, told the ABC that her community are on edge heading into the holidays.
"We are not out of the woods until we get a really good drop of rain and that may not come until March or April, so it's going to be a long summer."
Parts of Australia have been on high alert for bushfire danger this summer, following several quieter seasons compared with the 2019-20 fires which were linked to hundreds of deaths and swept across 24 million hectares of land.
The country has reeled from disaster to disaster in recent years, experiencing both record breaking floods and extreme heat, as it feels the effects of climate change.

Headline: The crocodile from Crocodile Dundee dies in Australia
Author: Emma Saunders, Culture reporter
Published Date: 2024-12-23T11:32:38.928Z
Text: The crocodile who starred in 1980s hit film Crocodile Dundee has died in Australia.
Burt, who was thought to be over 90 years old, appeared alongside Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski in the 1986 movie.
News of his death was confirmed by staff at Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin, a reptile and aquarium attraction where Burt had lived since 2008.
In a statement posted on Instagram, the wildlife centre wrote: "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Burt, the iconic saltwater crocodile and star of the Australian classic Crocodile Dundee.
"Burt passed away peacefully over the weekend, estimated to be over 90 years old, marking the end of an incredible era."
In the film, character Mick Dundee (Hogan) swaps the Australian outback for the jungle of New York after meeting American reporter Sue Charlton (Kozlowski), who eventually falls in love with him.
The croc is famously seen in the scene where Kozlowski's character is attacked as she kneels next to a creek.
Burt, who was captured in the 1980s in the Northern Territory's Reynolds River, was described by Crocasourus Cove as having a "bold" personality.
"Burt was a confirmed bachelor - an attitude he made clear during his earlier years at a crocodile farm," the centre's statement continued.
"His fiery temperament earned him the respect of his caretakers and visitors alike, as he embodied the raw and untamed spirit of the saltwater crocodile."
"Burt was truly one of a kind. He wasn't just a crocodile; he was a force of nature and a reminder of the power and majesty of these incredible creatures.
"While his personality could be challenging, it was also what made him so memorable and beloved by those who worked with him and the thousands who visited him over the years.
The statement concluded: "Visitors from around the globe marvelled at his impressive size and commanding presence, especially at feeding time."
It's not unusual for saltwater crocodiles to live beyond 70 years old, especially in captivity.
Burt will be honoured with a commemorative sign at the attraction.
Crocodile Dundee remains the highest grossing Australian film of all time, taking $47,707,598 (Australian dollars).
It also spawned two sequels, 1988's Crocodile Dundee II and 2001's Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.
Hogan and Kozlowski got married in 1990 but later divorced.
A documentary on the making of the film is expected to be released next year.

Text: Australia have dropped Nathan McSweeney and called up 19-year-old opener Sam Konstas to replace him for the final two Tests against India.
New South Wales' Konstas is in line to become Australia men's youngest Test batting debutant since Ian Craig in 1953.
McSweeney was preferred to Konstas at the start of the series but he managed only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40.
Australia's chief selector George Bailey said Konstas' selection offers the chance to "throw something different" at India's bowling attack.
"I think Sam's method and style is different to Nathan's, should we go down that path," he said.
Earlier this season Konstas scored two centuries against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, becoming the youngest player to do so since Ricky Ponting in 1993.
Should the right-hander be picked, he would become Australia's youngest Test debutant since current skipper Pat Cummins, who was 18 years and 193 days when he played against South Africa in 2011.
Seamer Jhye Richardson, who last played a Test in the 2021-22 Ashes, has also been recalled with Josh Hazlewood out injured.
Fellow quick Sean Abbott and all-rounder Beau Webster, both uncapped at Test level, have been retained in the squad, having been called up previously in the series but not selected in the XI.
Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, who, like McSweeney, have struggled at the top of the order, have retained their places in the squad.
The Boxing Day Test in Melbourne starts at 23:30 GMT on 25 December with the series tied at 1-1.
There will be ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app, where video highlights will also be available (all UK users only).
Australia squad for final two Tests v India: Pat Cummins (captain), Travis Head, Steve Smith, Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster
Konstas made his debut for New South Wales in 2023, less than two months after his 18th birthday, but has played only 11 first-class matches.
Part of the Australia team that won the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year, his breakthrough came with the twin centuries against South Australia in October when he followed a first-innings 152 - his first first-class hundred - with 105 in the second innings.
He has scored 471 runs at 58.87 in five matches in the Sheffield Shield this season and made a timely, 20-ball fifty for Sydney Thunder on his Big Bash debut on Tuesday, in doing so becoming the youngest man to score a fifty in the competition.
He also played for Prime Ministers XI against the India squad in a tour match between the first and second Tests and scored 107 from 97 balls against an attack featuring most of India's Test line-up.
He will still play in the Big Bash against Sydney Sixers on Saturday before joining up with the Test squad.

Text: British YouTuber Yung Filly has pleaded guilty to reckless driving in Australia while on bail over rape allegations.
The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, admitted to driving at almost 60km/h (37mph) over the speed limit on a Perth highway last month.
He is yet to enter a plea on eight sexual assault charges, over allegations he attacked a woman in his Perth hotel room after performing at a nightclub in September.
Barrientos is best known for his work with the YouTube collective Beta Squad, and has presented shows on BBC Three.
Barrientos appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday, where his lawyer said her client would enter a plea of guilty to the driving offence, which resulted in his car being impounded.
The case was adjourned until 30 January, to be heard alongside Barrientos' other charges, which include four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm and one count of choking.
The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music when the alleged rape occurred. His bail conditions bar him from leaving the state of Western Australia or posting about the case on social media.
Barrientos is a popular media figure in the UK, winning a Mobo Award for best media personality in 2021. He has also appeared on ITV's Soccer Aid and Channel 4's Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer.

Text: Veteran Australian broadcaster Alan Jones has pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing 10 young men over almost two decades.
The 83-year-old faces 34 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault.
Mr Jones is one of Australia's most influential media figures and a former coach of its national rugby union team. He has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023.
After appearing in court, he spoke publicly for the first time since his arrest last month, saying: "I have never indecently assaulted these people."
"I want you to understand this: these allegations are all either baseless or they distort the truth, and you should know that prior to my arrest I was given no opportunity by police to answer any of these allegations."
Mr Jones was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment on 18 November, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices.
Originally charged in relation to eight people - including a 17-year-old boy - police have since filed additional charges, and say investigations are continuing.
All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences.
Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio and TV host personally, and that at least one had been employed by him.
Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters last month.
"The law assumes that I am not guilty, and I am not guilty," Mr Jones told the media scrum waiting for him after his first court appearance in Sydney on Wednesday.
"That's all I can say at the moment, but I am emphatic that I'll be defending every charge before a jury in due course."
A former teacher, Mr Jones coached the Wallabies between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career.
He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics.
A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues.
The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy.
He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had "died of shame", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should "shove a sock" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern.

Text: Australia seamer Josh Hazlewood is likely to miss the rest of the Test series against India because of a calf injury.
The 33-year-old felt tightness in his calf during the warm-up ahead of day four in the third Test in Brisbane, and left the field after bowling one over in the morning session.
He was sent for scans and Australia say the injury is likely to result in him missing the fourth and fifth Tests in Melbourne and Sydney.
The right-armer missed the second-Test win in Adelaide with a side injury.
He was replaced by Scott Boland, while uncapped duo Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett were added to the squad.
"He felt it this morning in warm-ups and gave it a good crack," said bowling coach Daniel Vettori.
"It's just unfortunate for him to come back after putting so much effort in after another injury. It was tough on him.
"He's one of the best bowlers in the world and it obviously affects the whole team."

Headline: Bali Nine drug smugglers 'relieved' to be back in Australia

Text: The five remaining members of the infamous "Bali Nine" drug ring say they are "relieved and happy" to be home in Australia, after serving nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons.
Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj arrived in Darwin on Sunday following years of lobbying by Australia on their behalf.
"They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society," said a statement issued on behalf of the men and their families.
The high-profile case began in 2005 when Indonesia caught nine young Australians trying to smuggle 8.3kg (18lb) of heroin out of Bali strapped to their bodies.
The eight men and one woman were arrested at an airport and hotel in Bali after a tip-off from Australian police.
The case made global headlines when two of the gang's ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed by firing squad in 2015 - sparking a diplomatic row between neighbours Indonesia and Australia.
Other members of the Bali Nine - most of whom were aged under 21 - were handed sentences of either 20 years or life in prison.
The case put a spotlight on Indonesia's strict drug laws, some of the most stringent in the world.
One of the nine, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of cancer in prison in 2018. Shortly afterwards, Renae Lawrence, then 41, the only woman among the group, had her sentence commuted after spending almost 13 years in prison and returned to Australia the same year.
Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society.
The five are banned for life from entering Indonesia, a spokesman for the government there said in a statement.
On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to several of the men's "grateful" parents.
"They did a serious crime and they have rightly paid a serious price for it. But it was time for them to come home," he told reporters.
He said the deal did not come with conditions or favours Australia would have to repay: "This is an act of compassion by President Prabowo [Subianto] and we thank him for it."
The men and their families also said they were "immensely grateful" to Prabowo.
They also thanked the lawyers, diplomats and government figures who had helped advocate for them over the past two decades, before asking for privacy.
"The welfare of the men is a priority, they will need time and support, and we hope and trust our media and community will make allowance for this."
The five men are being put through medical checks at Darwin's Howard Springs facility - which was used for quarantine during the pandemic - and will begin a voluntary "rehabilitation process", Education Minister Jason Clare said. It is not clear what that entails, or how long the men will stay there.
He added that normal visa processes would apply to any Indonesian family members of the men, who did not follow them to Australia.
The Bishop of Townsville, Timothy Harris, who has supported the families of Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj since their arrests, said he immediately called Scott Rush's father Lee when he heard the news.
Scott's parents are eagerly awaiting the reunion, Bishop Harris told the BBC.
"They are mortified by what their son did. They always believed he has committed a crime... But this turn of events [has] filled them with a sense of anticipation."
However, he said it would take time for the men to heal from their experience and re-integrate into society.
"If you think that through, your son commits a crime [and was] incarcerated in a foreign country, they return. How does someone get re-integrated into the family, let alone society?"
"Things have changed. The relationships need to be rekindled. They are going to have to face that as time goes on," he said.
"Once [Scott's family] gets to embrace him... I hope and pray things will be better, because there's nothing like having your family [nearby]."

Text: A pilot who caused a deadly light plane crash on an island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been spared a jail sentence.
British tourist Jocelyn Spurway, 29, was killed and 21-year-old Irish woman Hannah O'Dowd seriously injured when the aircraft hit the sand on Middle Island in January 2017.
A jury found pilot Leslie Woodall guilty of dangerously operating a vehicle causing death and grievous bodily harm, after a short trial which focused on his actions after the plane's engine suddenly failed.
Woodall was given a two-year sentence, wholly suspended - which means he will remain free as long as he complies with certain conditions.
The three-day trial in the Brisbane District Court was shown footage filmed by one of the three passengers inside the plane, which captured the moment the engine stopped and Woodall sharply turned the plane to the left.
The Cessna 172N then rapidly lost altitude, before a wing hit the sand and it rolled.
Ms Spurway suffered fatal spinal injuries, and her friend Ms O'Dowd was left with a traumatic brain injury and a series of fractures. Woodall also sustained serious injuries, and a 13-year-old boy who was on board suffered a broken ankle.
Prosecutors argued it was not the engine failure that caused the crash, but rather Woodall's response to it.
Aviation experts who gave evidence during the trial agreed that Woodall, an experienced pilot, went against flight training and best practice. He should have kept the wings level in order to glide and safely land, they said.
However Woodall's defence team argued he had little other options available to him in a highly stressful situation.
In a 2019 police interview played to the court he told officers he was trying to reach a sandbank, according to reports by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
"I decided not to land in the water as it was deep, and I was concerned about the risks of drowning and the risk of bull sharks," the pilot said.
"I truly believe I did everything I could to ensure the safety of those on board."

Text: YouTuber Yung Filly is facing new charges of reckless driving, according to reports in Australia, where he is accused of raping a woman.
The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, is accused by police of driving past a speed camera at 158km/h (98mph) on a Perth highway last month.
It is alleged to have occurred whilst Barrientos was on bail over an alleged attack on a woman in a Perth hotel in September.
The BBC has contacted Barrientos's representatives for comment.
When approached for comment, police said they were unable to confirm the charges by name but said a 29-year-old man had been charged with reckless driving.
Police say the speeding incident happened on 17 November, in the High Wycombe area of Perth, where the speed limit is 100km/h, and his car was impounded.
Barrientos will appear in court accused of reckless driving on 19 December, where he will also appear over four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, and one count of impeding a person's normal breathing or circulation by applying pressure on or to their neck.
It is alleged Barrientos brought a woman in her 20s back to his hotel room after he had performed at the nightclub Bar1 in Perth. The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music.
Barrientos is best known for his work with the YouTube collective Beta Squad and has presented shows on BBC Three.
He has also appeared, in the UK, on ITV's Soccer Aid and Channel 4's Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer.
Barrientos won a Mobo Award for best media personality in 2021.

Headline: Children as young as 10 will face adult jail time in Australian state
Author: Hannah Ritchie, BBC News, Sydney

Text: The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.
The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to "community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders" and will act as a deterrent.
But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.
The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.
The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the "rights of victims" ahead of "the rights of criminals".
"These laws are for every Queenslander who has ever felt unsafe and been a victim of youth crime across our state," Premier David Crisafulli said after parliament passed the bill on Thursday.
Leading up to the vote, both sides of politics had claimed that Queensland was in the grips of a youth crime wave, and that a more punitive approach was necessary to combat the issue.
But data from the Australian bureau of statistics, shows that youth crime has halved in Queensland across the past 14 years, that it hit its lowest rate in recorded history in 2022, and has remained relatively steady since.
Figures from the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology also demonstrate a clear downward trend.
Dubbed by the government as "adult crime, adult time", the new laws list 13 offences which will now be subject to harsher prison sentences when committed by youths, including mandatory life detention for murder, with a non-parole period of 20 years.
Previously, the maximum penalty for young offenders convicted of murder was 10 years in jail, with life imprisonment only considered if the crime was "particularly heinous".
The laws also remove "detention as a last resort" provisions - which favour non-custodial orders, such as fines or community service, for children rather than incarceration - and will make it possible for judges to consider a child's full criminal history when sentencing.
The Queensland Police Union has called the changes "a leap forward in the right direction", while Queensland's new Attorney-General Deb Frecklington says it will give courts the ability to "better address patterns of offending" and "hold people accountable for their actions".
But in a summary, Frecklington also noted the changes were in direct conflict with international standards, that Indigenous children would be disproportionately impacted and that more youngsters were likely to be held in police cells for extended periods because detention centres are full.
Queensland already has more children in detention than any other Australian state or territory.
Premier Crisafulli said on Thursday that although there may be "pressure in the short-term" his government had a long-term plan to "deliver a raft of other detention facilities and different options".
Australia's commissioner for children, Anne Hollonds, described the changes as an "international embarrassment".
She also accused Queensland's government of "ignoring evidence" which suggests "the younger a child comes into contact with the justice system, the more likely it is that they will continue to commit more serious crimes".
"The fact that [the bill's] provisions are targeting our most at-risk children makes this retreat from human rights even more shocking," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Other legal experts, who gave evidence to a parliamentary hearing on the bill last week, said the laws could have unintended consequences for victims, with children being less likely to plead guilty given the tougher sentences, resulting in more trials and longer court delays.

Headline: Australia turns to rugby to curb China influence in PNG

Text: Papua New Guinea (PNG) will join Australia's national rugby league competition, after signing a deal that obligates them to shun security ties with China.
The Pacific nation has produced many stars of Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) and has long been lobbying to join the franchise.
Australia will provide A$600m (£301m, $384m) over ten years to set up the team – which will be based in Port Moresby and compete from 2028 – and help develop the game at a grassroots level across the Pacific region.
In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner.
The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called "Pacific family". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region.
If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team.
Announcing the agreement in Sydney on Thursday, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said it was a "monumental" opportunity for his country, and one aimed at fostering "unity" - not only between the 830 language groups in PNG, but also between the nation at large and its closest neighbour.
"For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people," he told reporters.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared it was a "great day" for both countries, and said PNG - the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport - "deserves" a spot in the league.
"The new team will belong to the people of Papua New Guinea… And I know it will have millions of proud fans barracking for it from day one," Albanese said.
It is a big milestone for the NRL too. This is the first time the competition, which is trying to lure international audiences, has expanded overseas. The only other foreign team, the New Zealand Warriors, has been a part of the competition since its inception almost three decades ago.
NRL boss Peter V'landys had been championing the PNG bid, arguing it was a huge opportunity for the league, as well as for PNG's economic development.
A name and uniform for the new team will be decided at a later point.
Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented.
The country has over the past decade been "thinking innovatively about how you can marry sport with policy to counter classical security threats" said Dr Murray, from Bond University.
In this case, he added, "the scale, the size, the scope and the funding, and the fact that it's being endorsed at such a high level with both prime ministers - that's never been done before".
"Basically, through this one channel, we will open up 20 or 30 other channels - for business, trade, policing, educational exchange, gender work, climate change... I think it is fantastic."
Australia and China have each been vying for greater influence in the Pacific in recent years. After Beijing inked a major policing deal with the Solomon Islands in 2022, Australia has spent years trying to forge exclusive security pacts with countries across the region – including a policing agreement with Tuvalu last year, and a treaty with Nauru unveiled earlier this week.
Some have lauded the pact with PNG - which declared independence from Australia in 1975 - as another major strategic win for Australia.
"Over the past couple of years, with the heightened geopolitical interest and engagement in the Pacific, something a lot of other middle powers and major powers have struggled to do is to get PNG on a deal of exclusivity for security partnerships," said Oliver Nobetau, a PNG government lawyer turned policy analyst at the Lowy Institute think tank.
Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a "thinning" relationship between the two countries.
Marape made a point to say the agreement "doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours".
"We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner," he said. "But in security, closer to home… our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed… together."
Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as "an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty".
Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging "transactional" dynamic in Pacific relations.
"People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view," Dr Murray said. "For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy."
Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region.
"China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure… which is sort of what China is good at… [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space," Mr Nobetau said.
"It's something that other countries can't do," Dr Murray added. "We need to use it, especially in a very, very contested region such as the Pacific."

Headline: Australia to force tech giants to keep paying for news

Text: Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.
The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.
Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.
The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; £125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.
The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.
In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was "charging one industry to subsidise another".
Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.
"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism," Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.
The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.
That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.
As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.
Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.
"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content… news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed," it said in a statement in February.
The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as "a fundamental dereliction" of Meta's "responsibility to its Australian users".
"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform," Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.
The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.
The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue.

Text: Australian police have launched an investigation after a car was set alight and houses were vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney.
The incident has been condemned by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a "hate crime". He told ABC News: "There's no place for antisemitism in this country, or anywhere for that matter."
It comes days after a fire engulfed a synagogue in Melbourne, causing minor injuries to one man, in what police there are treating as a probable terror attack.
Authorities in Sydney said they were seeking two people aged between 15 and 20 over the vandalism incident.
The pair had been wearing "face coverings and dark clothing" and were seen running from the scene, New South Wales Police said.
"We need public assistance to come forward and help identify those two people," Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters.
Police said the car blaze was extinguished shortly after firefighters were called to the scene in Woollahra, a suburb in Sydney's east, at around 01:00 local time (14:00 GMT).
Anti-Israel messages, including "Kill Israiel" [sic], were found at the scene, scrawled on the fence of two properties and cars.
The vehicle that was set on fire had been driven to the scene by the suspects, police said.
Albanese said he had spoken to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) about the vandalism.
Earlier this week, the law enforcement body established a special taskforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism, including the alleged terror attack in Melbourne, and another vandalism spree that occurred in Woollahra last month. Police do not believe the two incidents in Woollahra are linked.
New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the latest incident appeared to have been "specifically designed" to "intimidate the Jewish community in Sydney".
"If the question is can we do more? I think the answer is yes, and I'm not closing the door to changes to the law," he told reporters, adding that he had spoken with Israel's Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon.
The president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, David Ossip, said his community was "deeply saddened" by what had happened, but that they would "not be cowed".

Text: Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has pleaded guilty over a car incident in Australia which killed his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins.
Hoskins died in hospital on 30 December 2023, after being struck by a vehicle being driven by Dennis outside their home in Adelaide.
The 34-year-old was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care, but on Tuesday he admitted a lesser charge - one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm.
Dennis - who has two children with Hoskins - will be sentenced at a later date.
Few details are known about the circumstances leading up to Hoskins's death.
However, Dennis's guilty plea means he has admitted to driving a car when Hoskins was in close proximity, knowing that act was likely to cause harm or being recklessly indifferent to whether it would.
"There was no intention of Mr Dennis to harm his wife and this charge does not charge him with responsibility for her death," the retired athlete's lawyer told the court.
Hoskins was a world champion in the team pursuit in 2015 and a two-time Olympian, and her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world.
She and Dennis married in 2018.
Dennis retired at the end of the 2023 season after a career in which he won stages at the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana.
A multiple world champion on both road and track, he won road time trial bronze at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, having won team pursuit silver at London 2012. He also won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022.

Text: A fire which ripped through Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue is being treated as a likely terror attack, Australian police say.
Three suspects are being hunted over Friday's early-morning blaze, which left one man with a minor burn to his hand and caused extensive damage.
Witnesses say they saw masked figures spreading what appeared to be an accelerant in the building, before setting it alight.
Victoria Police say they have no evidence that further antisemitic attacks are planned, but patrols are being increased to reassure the community.
After a meeting with Australian Federal Police and domestic spy agency Asio, the state police force said additional "intelligence" had led them to conclude the incident should be treated as a probable terror attack.
Commissioner Shane Patton said police had no information before the fire to suggest an arson attack was imminent.
He declined to provide any further details on the investigation while it continued.
Mr Patton's declaration came a day after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the incident as "quite clearly terrorism" while acknowledging police were still to make up their minds. He called his description a "personal view".
On Monday, state Premier Jacinta Allan said the terror designation meant police would now have extra resources for their investigation.
Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia, and that it has heightened fears of violence.
A few worshippers were inside the building at the time of the fire, and have described hearing banging and seeing a window smash, before liquids were thrown inside and lit on fire.
"The whole thing took off pretty quickly," synagogue board member Benjamin Klein, who spoke to witnesses, told The Age newspaper.
After officers at the scene were confronted by angry and scared worshippers on Friday, Mr Patton said police were focused on ensuring their safety.
"We have... extra police officers deployed in those areas where there are high numbers of Jewish persons living and congregating," he said.
Allan also called for the city to rally behind its Jewish communities.
"We cannot let this conflict overseas continue to be a cloak for behaviour like [this]."
Albanese also on Monday announced a new federal strikeforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism.
The prime minister said a special response was needed to combat the rising threat, pointing to two other recent incidents - the vandalism of a Jewish MP's office and an attack in Sydney in which a car was torched and buildings graffitied.

Text: Australian breaker Rachael Gunn's legal team has stopped a musical parody about her journey to the Paris Olympics from taking to the stage.
The show titled 'Raygun: The Musical' was created by Australian comedian Steph Broadbridge, who was also due to feature in the cast.
It was due to debut on Saturday at Kinselas in Darlinghurst, Sydney, but Broadbridge was forced to cancel the show after lawyers sent a cease and desist letter, saying that the Olympian owned the dance moves.
In a statement to the Guardian, Gunn's legal and management team said it was committed to protecting her intellectual property and ensuring that her brand remained strong and respected.
Some of Gunn's unconventional moves - such as the sprinkler and kangaroo-hop - went viral after her Olympics performance.
Now, Gunn's lawyers have reportedly trademarked the poster for the musical and advised Broadbridge that she was "not allowed" to do the kangaroo dance because Gunn "owns" it.
"That one did puzzle me - I mean, that's an Olympic-level dance," Broadbridge said in her Instagram video. "How would I possibly be able to do that without any formal breakdancing training?"
Broadbridge said on Instagram that she planned for the show to be "back soon" and "with a whole new story arc". Everyone who was due to attend the trial show would be offered a refund for their A$10 ticket, she added.
She said: "They [Gunn's legal team] were worried I was damaging her brand, which I would never."
Gunn failed to receive a single point from judges at this summer's Olympic games and was subsequently eliminated from the round-robin stage which led to a torrent of abuse online.
Despite being defended by officials, her performance divided opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the scene.
Gunn had initially planned to keep competing after the Olympics, but in November said the saga had been so "upsetting" that she changed her mind and had decided to retire.
She ended her video saying that she intends to change the name of her character to "Raygun with an I" in hopes that "fixes everyone's concerns".
In their statement to The Guardian, Gunn's legal team said: "While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael's creative rights and the integrity of her work.
"This action is not intended to diminish the contributions of others, but rather to ensure her brand is properly represented and protected in all future endeavours."

Text: Worshippers were forced to flee an Australian synagogue after it was set on fire in what the prime minister condemned as an "act of hate".
Firefighters were called to Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue just after 04:00 local time on Friday (17:00 GMT Thursday) and arrived to find the building fully ablaze.
Community leaders told local media that "a few people" were inside at the time for morning prayers, and they had reported seeing firebombs thrown. One person was injured and the fire caused extensive damage.
Police say they believe the fire was deliberately lit but are keeping an "open mind" on a motive.
In a statement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the incident in Ripponlea, in the city's south-east, was "clearly aimed at creating fear in the community".
"This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage," he wrote.
"I have zero tolerance for antisemitism."
He added that he had been briefed by the Australian Federal Police, who would provide support to authorities in the state of Victoria.
"The people involved must be caught and face the full force of the law."
Victoria Police said the exact cause of the fire had not yet been determined and an arson chemist would visit the site.
However Det Insp Chris Murray said a witness had told them two people in masks appeared to have spread accelerant inside the building.
"We believe it was deliberate. We believe it has been targeted," he added. "What we don't know is why."
He appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage from the local area, to contact police.
Synagogue board member Benjamin Klein told The Age newspaper that people inside "heard banging on the door and the window, and some liquids came through which were lit".
"The whole thing took off pretty quickly," he said.
A man who was inside at the time, Yumi Friedman, added that a window had been smashed, sending "glass flying".
Mr Friedman told reporters his hand was burned on a door knob when he tried to return to the synagogue to fight the blaze.
Det Insp Murray - who was confronted by an angry worshipper while updating the press - said police would be committing significant resources to the investigation and increasing patrols around the area.
"We're going to do our best to make sure that they can return, as they should, to their local synagogues, doing what is absolutely Australian - that is to be able to worship without fear."
Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia.
"None of the Jewish community is surprised. We've known this has been coming," Executive Council of Australian Jewry president Daniel Aghion said.

Text: A man wanted over one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, dubbed the Easey Street murders, has arrived in Melbourne after being extradited from Italy.
Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were stabbed to death in their Melbourne house in 1977, in a case which has gripped the nation ever since.
Police said suspect Perry Kouroumblis, 65, only became the focus of their investigation in recent years after DNA testing breakthroughs.
Mr Kouroumblis - who has not been charged and maintains his innocence - was detained in Italy in September. If charged, he is expected to face court later this week, according to local media.
Mr Kouroumblis first came to police attention the week after the murders, when the then 17-year-old said he had found a bloodied knife near the scene in Easey Street, Collingwood, an inner-city suburb.
The bodies of the high school friends were discovered three days after they were last seen alive. Ms Armstrong's one-year-old son was also found in the home, unharmed in his cot.
Both women had been stabbed more than a dozen times and Ms Armstrong had been sexually assaulted, police say.
The case has long drawn huge interest - becoming the subject of major police appeals, true crime books and a hit podcast. In 2017 Victoria Police offered a A$1m (£511,800, $647,600) reward for information.
Commissioner Shane Patton described the murders as "an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide" when announcing the arrest of Mr Kouroumblis - a dual Greek-Australian citizen - in Rome in September.
"This was a crime that struck at the heart of our community - two women in their own home, where they should have felt their safest," he said.
Police had issued an Interpol red notice for Mr Kouroumblis on two charges of murder and one of rape, after he left Australia about seven years ago.
But he was not able to be arrested in Greece, where he had been living, as the country's law requires murder charges to be laid within 20 years of an alleged crime.
At the time of Mr Kouroumblis's arrest, the women's families released a statement, saying their lives had been changed "irrevocably" by the murders.
"For two quiet families from country Victoria it has always been impossible to comprehend the needless and violent manner in which Suzanne and Susan died," the statement read.
Addressing police, they said: "For always giving us hope and never giving up, we simply say, thank you."

Text: Australian Police have seized 2.3 tonnes of cocaine from a broken-down boat off the coast of Queensland, authorities said on Monday.
Eleven men and two juveniles were arrested, including the vessel's crew and others waiting on the shore to collect the illegal shipment.
The drugs had an estimated street value of A$760m ($490m; £388m), with the potential to be distributed across 11.7 million separate street deals - making it the largest cocaine bust in Australian history.
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) alleged one of the men arrested on Saturday night was vice-president of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle club’s Brisbane chapter.
Biker gangs are notorious in Australia for their drug violence, with more than 1,000 shootings recorded since the 1980s.
This recent cocaine bust came as part of a wider investigation into the Comanchero gang, codenamed Operation Tyrrendor, which began last month.
Authorities said they received intelligence suggesting a criminal syndicate with links to the gang was planning to import illegal drugs into Australia.
This comes after reports last week that the Colombian navy intercepted a semi-submersible carrying cocaine to Australia.
Investigators told reporters in Brisbane the record cocaine shipment had come from an unidentified South American country.
The AFP worked with the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and the Australian Border Force (ABF) to track a fishing boat, recently purchased by a 35-year-old man.
On Saturday night, it was being used to transport the cocaine delivery from a larger mothership to the Queensland coast when it suffered a mechanical fault, police said.
Stranded about 18km from the north-eastern tip of K'gari, it was intercepted by the AFP and QPS, who found 51 bales of cocaine tied with rope netting.
Two men were arrested on the boat and two others were arrested on the coast while waiting for the shipment.
A further three arrests were made at a nearby fast-food restaurant, with five others at a traffic stop.
The final arrest was made in Brisbane after the AFP and QPS executed a search warrant.
All 11 men and two juveniles were were charged with conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of cocaine, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

Text: A driver had to make an unexpected stop on a Melbourne motorway after she looked down to find a deadly snake inside her car - and slithering up her leg.
The police were called to conduct a welfare check on the woman, who was "acting hiss-terically on the side of the road" attempting to flag down passing cars, Victoria Police said.
The woman told officers she had been driving at 80km/h (50mph) on the Monash freeway when she felt something on her foot.
Melbourne Snake Control were called in to retrieve the animal, which was identified as a tiger snake, one of the world's most venomous reptiles.
The driver was taken to hospital as a precaution, but appears to have escaped unharmed, according to paramedics.
"Remarkably, she was able to fend the snake off her and weave through traffic before pulling over and leaping out of her car to safety", Victoria Police said.
Officers said she had been "rattled" and "in a state of shock".
Passing drivers were "left in bewilderment" as the snake was pulled out of the car, police added; Tim Nanninga from Melbourne Snake Control said some in traffic started to video the removal.
He told ABC News he released the snake back into the wild "well away from houses, people and pets".

Text: Australia have called up uncapped duo Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett for the second Test against India after seamer Josh Hazlewood was ruled out through injury.
Cricket Australia said Hazlewood will miss the day-night match at the Adelaide Oval with a "low grade left side injury".
The 33-year-old, who has taken 278 wickets in 71 Tests, will remain with Australia's squad in Adelaide to prepare for the remainder of the series.
Hazlewood was the pick of Australia's bowlers in the first innings of the first Test when he finished with figures of 4-29 as India were dismissed for 150.
His place in the side for the second Test which starts on 6 December is widely expected to go to experienced seamer Scott Boland.
Abbott, 32, has taken 29 wickets in 26 one-day internationals and 26 wickets in 20 T20 internationals for Australia but has never played Test cricket.
He has taken 261 wickets in 87 first-class matches.
Doggett has never played for Australia but was an unused member of their squad for the 2018 Test series series against Pakistan.
The 30-year-old has taken 142 wickets in 40 first-class matches and took a career-best 6-15 for Australia A against India A in October.
Uncapped Tasmania all-rounder Beau Webster was named in the squad earlier this week as cover for Mitchell Marsh, who is struggling for fitness following Australia's defeat in the first Test in Perth.

Text: A former childcare worker dubbed "one of Australia's worst paedophiles" has been sentenced to life in prison for raping and sexually abusing almost 70 girls.
Ashley Paul Griffith, 47, confessed to 307 offences committed at childcare centres in the Australian state of Queensland and overseas between 2003 and 2022. His victims were aged between one and seven.
Judge Paul Smith called the scale and nature of the crimes "depraved" and "horrendous", saying "there was a significant breach of trust".
In addition to this case, the BBC understands Griffith is separately accused of abusing at least two dozen children in the Australian state of New South Wales and in Italy.
In the Brisbane District Court on Friday, Judge Smith said Griffith - who the court heard had a "paedophilic disorder" - had a high risk of reoffending, ordering a non-parole period of at least 27 years.
Griffith was first arrested in August 2022 by the Australian Federal Police, and a year later charged with more than 1,600 child sex offences. Most of these were eventually dropped.
Warning: This story contains details readers might find distressing
Investigators found thousands of photographs and videos of his abuse, which he had filmed and uploaded onto the dark web.
Although faces were cropped out of the footage, they managed to trace them to Griffith because of a unique set of bedsheets seen in the background of some of the videos, which had been sold to childcare centres across Queensland.
He pleaded guilty to 28 counts of rape, almost 200 charges relating to indecent treatment of a child, and several related to making and sharing child exploitation material.
Four of the girls who featured in his videos were from a childcare centre in Pisa, Italy. His other 65 victims were from 11 locations across Brisbane.
Ahead of his sentence behind handed down, the court heard a string of emotional statements from some of those victims and their parents - who cannot be identified for legal reasons.
Among them were two sisters who were abused in kindergarten, one of whom recalled Griffith being her favourite teacher.
"To find out what he was really doing was devastating... I don’t seem to be able to process it even now, because there’s a disconnect between what I remember and the reality," she said, according to The Courier Mail.
Another woman told how his actions had robbed her of a normal childhood, recounting her struggles with mental illness in the years since.
"I will never know what my life could have been like," she is quoted as saying, in an article by The Guardian Australia.
"I can never know what it would have been to grow up unafraid of people."
Parents meanwhile told the court of their horror upon discovering the crimes inflicted upon their children, with several saying they struggled to forgive themselves for trusting Griffith.
"(My daughter) loved you like an uncle and you used her like a toy," one said, according to News Corp Australia.
Another explained how she was trying to keep the burden of knowledge of the abuse from her daughter.
"I cannot undo what you did to her body but will do everything I can to limit the damage to her mind," she said, according to the Courier Mail.
Outside court, the families called for an investigation into the childcare centres - and broader system - in which Griffith was able to go undetected for so long.
"Parents are walking their children into these centres today with a false sense of security," one father told reporters.

Headline: Australia approves social media ban on under-16s

Text: Australia will ban children under 16 from using social media, after its parliament approved the world's strictest laws.
The ban, which will not take effect for at least 12 months, could see tech companies fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they don't comply.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the legislation is needed to protect young people from the "harms" of social media, something many parent groups have echoed.
But critics say questions over how the ban will work - and its impact on privacy and social connection - have been left unanswered.
This is not the first attempt globally to restrict children's social media use, but the minimum age of 16 is the highest set by any country. Unlike other attempts, it also does not include exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.
Having passed the Senate by 34 votes to 19 late on Thursday, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where it passed early on Friday.
“We want our kids to have a childhood and parents to know we have their backs," Albanese told reporters afterwards.
The legislation does not specify which platforms will be banned. Those decisions will be made later by Australia’s communications minister, who will seek advice from the eSafety Commissioner - an internet regulator that will enforce the rules.
However the minister, Michelle Rowland, has said the ban will include Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and X. Gaming and messaging platforms are exempt, as are sites that can be accessed without an account, meaning YouTube, for instance, is likely to be spared.
The government says will it rely on some form of age-verification technology to implement the restrictions, and options will be tested in the coming months. The onus will be on the social media platforms to add these processes themselves.
However digital researchers have warned there are no guarantees the unspecified technology - which could rely on biometrics or identity information - will work. Critics have also sought assurances that privacy will be protected.
They have also warned that restrictions could easily be circumvented through tools like a VPN - which can disguise a user’s location and make them appear to be logging on from another country.
Children who find ways to flout the rules will not face penalties, however.
Polling on the reforms, though limited, suggests it is supported by a majority of Australian parents and caregivers.
"For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out," Amy Friedlander, who was among those lobbying for the ban, recently told the BBC.
"We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of."
But many experts say the ban is "too blunt an instrument" to effectively address the risks associated with social media use, and have warned it could end up pushing children into less regulated corners of the internet.
During a short consultation period before the bill passed, Google and Snap criticised the legislation for not providing more detail, and Meta said the bill would be "ineffective" and not meet its stated aim of making kids safer.
In its submission, TikTok said the government’s definition of a social media platform was so "broad and unclear" that "almost every online service could fall within [it]".
X questioned the "lawfulness" of the bill - saying it may not be compatible with international regulations and human rights treaties which Australia has signed.
Some youth advocates also accused the government of not fully understanding the role social media plays in their lives, and locking them out of the debate.
"We understand we are vulnerable to the risks and negative impacts of social media… but we need to be involved in developing solutions," wrote the eSafety Youth Council, which advises the regulator.
Albanese has acknowledged the debate is complex but steadfastly defended the bill.
"We don't argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for [children] under 18 doesn’t mean that someone under 18 never has access – but we know that it’s the right thing to do," he said on Friday.
Last year, France introduced legislation to block social media access for children under 15 without parental consent, though research indicates almost half of users were able to avoid the ban using a VPN.
A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - was overturned by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional.
Australia’s laws are being watched with great interest by global leaders.
Norway has recently pledged to follow in the country’s footsteps, and last week the UK’s technology secretary said a similar ban was “on the table” - though he later added “not... at the moment”.

Text: Australia have added uncapped Tasmania all-rounder Beau Webster to their squad for the second Test against India in Adelaide.
The 30-year-old, who was player of the year in the Sheffield Shield last season, will join the national team for the match which starts on 6 December.
Webster averages 38 with the bat in first-class cricket and 37 with the ball.
He will provide cover for Mitchell Marsh, who is struggling for fitness following Australia's defeat in the first Test in Perth.
The Tasmanian, who bowls mostly seam but can also deliver off-spin, joins an otherwise unchanged squad as the home side look to square the five-match series.
He scored 61 and 49 batting for Tasmania against New South Wales this week, taking five wickets with the ball.
Earlier this month he scored 145 runs in two matches against India A, along with taking seven wickets at an average of 19.57.

While few Australians have been banging the door down domestically, Webster has impressed. In the last four editions of the Sheffield Shield he’s the fourth leading run scorer, and is the only batter to average in excess of 50 having played at least 10 matches.
While spinners do tend to find life difficult in Australia, Webster’s recent record against them - an average of 172 in the last four years - is exceptional. He’s a tall man and loves to pull (average 94) and cut (average 200) the quicks.
Webster could also relieve the pressure that’s been placed on Australia’s fifth bowler Mitchell Marsh, who continues to struggle with his fitness. He often comes on first change for Tasmania, and in the 2023-24 Sheffield Shield season took 30 wickets at an average of 29, with an unusual mix of seam up and spin deliveries.
County fans may also be familiar with Webster from a brief stint with Gloucestershire last season, where he averaged 58 with the bat from four County Championship matches, and took a tidy 16 wickets at 21.

Headline: Officer who Tasered 95-year-old guilty of manslaughter

Text: A police officer who Tasered a 95-year-old woman with dementia symptoms at an Australian care home has been found guilty of her manslaughter.
Kristian White, 34, used his weapon on Clare Nowland after the great-grandmother was found wandering with a small kitchen knife in the early hours of 17 May 2023.
Her death a week later caused public outcry, but White - a senior constable - argued at trial that his use of force was reasonable and proportionate to the threat.
Prosecutors, however, said Mrs Nowland - who relied on a walker to get around and weighed under 48kg (105lb) - was not a danger and that the "impatient" officer had neglected his duty of care to her.
Police and paramedics were called to Yallambee Lodge - in the town of Cooma about 114km (71 miles) south of Canberra – around 04:00 on the day of the incident, after Mrs Nowland had been seen roaming the care home with two serrated steak knives.
The trial in the New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court heard that Mrs Nowland, while not formally diagnosed with dementia, had been displaying signs of cognitive decline in the months leading up to her death and had at times behaved aggressively towards healthcare workers.
At one point that night she had entered the room of another resident holding the knives, though he told the court he did not feel unsafe, and she had also later thrown one of the blades at a staff member.
When emergency services found Mrs Nowland, they repeatedly asked her to drop the knife in her right hand, and – using thick gloves – had tried to disarm her themselves, the court was told.
In the moments before she was hit by the Taser, footage played to the jury showed the elderly woman using her walker to slowly shuffle forward - 1m (3.3ft) over the course of a minute - before stopping and raising the blade.
White warned Mrs Nowland his weapon was aimed at her, before saying "bugger it" and firing it, while she was still 1.5m-2m away. She fell and hit her head, triggering a fatal brain bleed.
“Who could she have injured at that moment? No one,” Crown prosecutor Brett Hatfield said, summing up his case for the jury last week.
He said White had used his weapon only three minutes after finding the woman: “He was fed up, impatient, not prepared to wait any longer.”
However in a written incident report, the officer - who had been stood down from duties while facing court - said he deployed his Taser because he felt a “violent confrontation was imminent”.
In court he added that he didn’t think Mrs Nowland would be “significantly injured” and that he was “devastated” by her death.
The defence pointed to evidence from one of the paramedics and White’s police partner, who both said Mrs Nowland had made them feel scared for their safety.
"I thought that I was going to be stabbed,” Jessica Pank, also a senior constable, said.
However, both agreed they could have easily moved to safety, given Mrs Nowland’s limited mobility.
Mrs Nowland's family, who were in court to hear the jury's verdict, thanked prosecutors, the judge and the jury.
"The family will take some time to come to terms with the jury’s confirmation that Clare’s death at the hands of a serving NSW police officer was a criminal and unjustified act," they said in a statement issued by a lawyer, which also asked for privacy.
NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Wednesday said White's employment was still under legal review.
She added that the force's Taser policies and training had also been reviewed but found to be appropriate.
"The death of Clare Nowland is a terrible tragedy... this should never have happened," she said.
White, who remains on bail, will be sentenced at a later date.

Text: Warning: Some people may find this article upsetting. For help and support dealing with grief, please visit the BBC Action Line
At some point in the previous year, for a lot of people who follow cricket, the thought would have come up.
Late November in the last nine years has included moments of remembrance for Phillip Hughes, Australia's prodigy who died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield in 2014, trying to make a score to get back into the Test team. This year marks a decade since that loss.
In grief, milestones are everywhere. The ones that surprise us are marked in space, things we stumble into like low furniture. Here's a garden near my old house, and here's me remembering the last time you walked through it.
The predictable ones are marked in time. Months at first, then anniversaries, birthdays twinned in the mental calendar with dates of death. Some dates evaporate. Some lodge.
So in a world that puts store in anniversaries, this one is significant. And complicated. Hughes' injury happened on 25 November, two days before an official announcement of death.
That means there is not exactly an anniversary, but more a long weekend of mourning. For those three days in the cricket world you are acutely aware of the sensitivity.
This coming week or two his story will feature heavily. The Perth Test, which finished on Monday, was never planned to be part of this, given the lack of certainty around an end date. The ceremony instead will happen around the Adelaide Test from 6 December.
Hughes' final match was for South Australia, and the tribute Test that followed his death was also against India at Adelaide.
Three of those players from a decade ago were still in the team in Perth this week: Nathan Lyon, Steve Smith and Mitchell Marsh. The 2014 Shield match involved three current players - Lyon, Mitchell Starc and Travis Head - as well as commentators Callum Ferguson, David Warner and Brad Haddin.
Even now, we probably underestimate the effect on that generation of cricketers. The players at that match had the trauma of being there.
Others who were not there still suffered. Peter Siddle played for Victoria but was Hughes' national team-mate. After a Test hat-trick on his birthday in 2010, Siddle had a fun three years of people posting memes about it each year.
But his birthday is 25 November. From 2014 the association changed completely, and he later explained in a podcast interview how he became weighed down with sadness whenever someone mentioned his birthday.
Glenn Maxwell became a meme, too, when he charged a pace bowler in a Big Bash game before failing to play a shot and being bowled. He was mocked worldwide.
Melbourne journalist Ron Reed wrote that it "looked like the work of a man in a mental meltdown" and that "his form has deteriorated alarmingly over the past few weeks" - but even then nobody joined the dots.
It was one month after Hughes had died. Maxwell was an emotional wreck, the two of them close from age-group cricket. Only this year Maxwell explained the context in his book. Until then nobody had asked.
Or take Michael Clarke, national captain at the time, close with Hughes from New South Wales cricket, who gave the very public eulogy days before leading his team in the tribute Test. Clarke later said that he should have retired after that match, rather than battling to lead the 2015 World Cup and Ashes campaigns when he was mentally shot.
Even for people who did not know Hughes, the 10-year commemoration will be emotional. For so many this is the defining memory of 2014: the intense and spontaneous upswell of sorrow, how astonishing it was to see and share it across Australia and worldwide.
The symbolism made sense. Hughes represented youth and vitality, as a 25-year-old sportsman. Potential, as a player of 26 Tests who was tipped to play a hundred more. Injustice, first at the trivial level of his problems with selectors, then the tragic luck of his injury. Talent, that would never get its full display. A prodigy cut short, a smiling kid who was apparently everyone's mate. Losing those things moved people deeply.
This year, people will revisit those feelings. The sudden sadness, the surprise. They will see how much time has passed and think about how different they were, their life was, our world was. They will feel that world moving on.
Time is supposed to ease grief, but it sharpens it too: time passing means that your time with the person you loved grows further away. That holds its own grief. They recede, you keep moving on a path they can no longer join.
This is the part of memory, the one means of keeping somebody with you when your ways have parted. Now and then as you move through your world, it offers ways to remind you, and you listen.

Headline: Kayaker's leg amputated in middle of river after 20-hour rescue

Text: A tourist in Tasmania has had his leg amputated in the middle of a raging river after getting trapped between rocks during a kayaking trip with friends.
Medics said they made the "life or death" decision in consultation with the international visitor during a complex rescue on the Franklin River lasting some 20 hours.
The visitor in his 60s was partially submerged in water throughout the ordeal, and rescuers said it was clear that "had he remained in the location where he was, and trapped in the rock crevice he would not have survived".
Multiple attempts to move him prior to the amputation were unsuccessful, police in the Australian island state said.
The tourist was kayaking with a group in the south-west of Tasmania when his leg got stuck between rocks in an area of rapids on Friday afternoon.
Emergency services rushed to the remote and inaccessible area after the man's smartwatch called for assistance, police said.
After a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to free the man overnight and as his condition deteriorated, the decision was made to amputate his leg so he could be winched from the location and airlifted to hospital.
"This rescue was an extremely challenging and technical operation, and an incredible effort over many hours to save the man’s life,” Doug Oosterloo, acting assistant commissioner at Tasmania Police, said in a statement.
"This was a life and death situation," Oosterloo told Australian national broadcaster ABC.
The man is now in a critical condition in hospital.
Oosterloo said that though the kayaker was “well prepared”, he wasn’t prepared for spending "that significant amount of time in a rock crevice with that temperature and the torrent of water that was he was under”.
The other 10 travellers who were kayaking with the man were being airlifted from the area and police plan to speak to them about how the accident happened, the Australian Associated Press reported.
Oosterloo told the news agency that the tourists had stopped kayaking and were on the shore when the man slipped.
“He was scouting the area and he slipped and fell into that rock crevice,” Oosterloo said.

Text: Singer Katy Perry has successfully appealed against a trademark decision over her name, after being sued by an Australian designer who sells clothes under her birth name Katie Perry.
Three appeals judges on Friday overturned a court decision last year that favoured Katie Taylor over merchandise sold by the pop star during a 2014 tour of Australia.
The judges said Perry had been using her name as a trademark five years before Taylor started her business, adding that by that time, Perry had attained an "international reputation" in entertainment.
The judges also cancelled Taylor's trademark registration on Friday.
Taylor had likened her legal battle with Perry to "David and Goliath". She told the Sydney Morning Herald after Friday's ruling that she was "devastated" with the case outcome.
The appeals judges said it was "unfortunate" that the case pitted two enterprising women who used their names as trademarks but were unaware that the other existed.
“Both women put blood, sweat and tears into developing their businesses,” the judges said.
“As the fame of one grew internationally, the other became aware of her namesake and filed a trademark application,” they said.
The judge who ruled in favour of Taylor last year referenced one of Perry's biggest hits in her decision: "This is a tale of two women, two teenage dreams and one name".
Friday's ruling comes as Perry prepares for her Lifetimes world tour in early 2025 to support her comeback album 143.

Headline: Australia wants to ban kids from social media. Will it work?

Text: “I felt really scared to be honest,” says James, describing an incident on Snapchat that left him questioning whether it was safe to go to school.
The Australian boy, 12, had had a disagreement with a friend, and one night before bed the boy added him to a group chat with two older teenagers.
Almost instantly, his phone “started blowing up” with a string of violent messages.
“One of them sounded like he was probably 17,” James tells the BBC. “He sent me videos of him with a machete… he was waving it around. Then there were voice messages saying that they were going to catch me and stab me.”
James - not his real name - first joined Snapchat when he was 10, after a classmate suggested everyone in their friendship group get the app. But after telling his parents about his cyberbullying experience, which was ultimately resolved by his school, James deleted his account.
His experience is a cautionary tale that shows why the Australian government’s proposed social media ban on children under 16 is necessary, says his mother Emma, who is also using a pseudonym.
The laws, which were tabled in parliament's lower house on Thursday, have been billed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as “world-leading”.
But while many parents have applauded the move, some experts have questioned whether kids should - or even can - be barred from accessing social media, and what the adverse effects of doing so may be.
Albanese says the ban - which will cover platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram - is about protecting kids from the “harms” of social media.
"This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood. We want parents to have peace of mind," he said on Thursday.
The new legislation provides a "framework" for the ban. But the 17-page document, which is expected to head to the Senate next week, is sparse on detail.
Instead, it will be up to the nation’s internet regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to hash out how to implement and enforce the rules, which will not come into effect for at least 12 months after legislation is passed.
According to the bill, the ban will apply to all children under 16 and that there will be no exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.
Tech companies will face penalties of up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7) if they do not comply, but there will be exemptions for platforms which are able to create “low-risk services" deemed suitable for kids. Criteria for this threshold are yet to be set.
Messaging services and gaming sites, however, will not be restricted, as will some sites that can be accessed without an account like YouTube, which has prompted questions over how regulators will determine what is and isn’t a social media platform in a fast-moving landscape.
A group representing the interests of tech companies such as Meta, Snapchat and X in Australia has dismissed the ban as “a 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges”.
Such legislation could push kids into “dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet”, Digital Industry Group Inc says - a fear also expressed by some experts.
eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant has acknowledged the gargantuan task her office will face when enforcing the ban, given “technology change is always going to outpace policy”.
“It will always be fluid, and this is why regulators like eSafety have to be nimble,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live.
But Ms Inman Grant has also raised concerns about the central idea behind the government’s policy, which is that there’s a causal link between social media and declining mental health.
“I would say that the evidence base is not settled at all,” she said, pointing to research from her own office which found that some of the most vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ or First Nations teenagers, “feel more themselves online than they do in the real world”.
This is a sentiment echoed by Lucas Lane, 15, who runs an online business selling nail polish to boys. “This [ban] destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen,” the Perth teenager tells the BBC.
Ms Inman Grant would rather see tech companies clean up their platforms, as well as more investment in education tools to help young people stay safe online. She uses the analogy of teaching children to swim, rather than banning them from the water.
“We don’t fence the ocean… but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,” she told parliament earlier this year.
But Emma - who has lobbied for the ban through the parent-led Heads Up Alliance - sees it differently.
“Should we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?" she says.
“Or should we just allow them to be kids and learn how to be sociable outside with each other, and then start these discussions later on?”
Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees.
“We can’t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven’t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren’t ready for it.”
Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as "too blunt an instrument" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have “safe access” to digital environments.
It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that’s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations.
To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce "digital duty of care" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety.
Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban “could be part of a strategy, it absolutely can’t be the whole strategy”.
She says “the biggest piece of the puzzle” should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media.
The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free “digital literacy tools” to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren’t receiving regular lessons.
Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the “enormous risks” associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online.
The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested.
In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user’s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to “preserve” their privacy.
However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. “I can’t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,” she tells the BBC.
Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online.
In 2011, South Korea passed its “shutdown law” which prevented children under 16 from playing internet games between 22:30 and 6:00, but the rules - which faced backlash - were later scrapped citing the need to “respect the rights of youths”.
More recently France introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent. Research indicated almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN.
A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - ran into a different issue: it was blocked by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional.
Albanese has conceded that Australia's proposal may not be foolproof, and if it passes the parliament, it would be subject to a review.
"We all know technology moves fast and some people will try to find ways around these new laws but that is not a reason to ignore the responsibility that we have," he told lawmakers.
But for mothers like Emma and Ms Friedlander - who have lobbied for the changes - it's the message that the ban sends which matters most.
“For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out socially,” Ms Friedlander says.
“We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.”
James says that since quitting Snapchat he’s found himself spending more time outside with friends.
And he hopes that the new laws could enable more kids like him to “get out and do the things they love” instead of feeling pressured to be online.

Headline: Uncertainty after Australia foreign students bill hits opposition

Text: Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is “not over” despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says.
The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation.
The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week.
However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough.
Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (£25.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy.
Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought "no sense of relief" for him.
"I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now," said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities.
The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks.
Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector.
The legislation, currently before the Senate, has not been formally withdrawn by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government but it cannot pass without the support of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition or the Greens, who also oppose it.
Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill "a dog's breakfast" and vowed to introduce "deeper cuts" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May.
The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill "dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause".
The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked "tough" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years.
The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place.
The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia’s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed.
But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure.
"The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution," Mr Sheehy said.
"We're nowhere closer to providing the certainty, stability and growth the government promised us all those many months ago when they proposed caps."

Headline: Australian senator censured for heckling King

Text: Australian lawmakers have voted to censure an Aboriginal senator who heckled King Charles during his visit to Canberra last month, to express their "profound disapproval" of her protest.
Lidia Thorpe shouted "you are not my King" and "this is not your land" shortly after the King addressed the Great Hall of Parliament, in an effort to highlight the impacts of British colonisation.
The Senate's censure, which passed 46-12, described Thorpe's actions as "disrespectful and disruptive" and said they should disqualify her from representing the chamber as a member of any delegation.
A censure motion is politically symbolic but carries no constitutional or legal weight.
Shortly after the Senate vote on Monday, Thorpe told reporters she had been denied her right to respond in the chamber due to a flight delay.
"The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the first peoples of this country... I will not be silent," the independent senator said.
Her protest last month drew immediate ire from across the political aisle, as well as from some prominent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders.
But it also drew praise from some activists who argued that it highlighted the plight of Australia's first inhabitants, who endured colonial violence and still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians.
Thorpe is among those who have advocated for a treaty between Australia’s government and its first inhabitants.
Unlike New Zealand and other former British colonies, a treaty with Indigenous peoples in Australia was never established. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people emphasise that they never ceded their sovereignty or land to the Crown.
Despite the protest, the King was warmly greeted by Australian crowds during his five-day tour alongside Queen Camilla.
“You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown. Nothing stands still," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in an official address.
Thorpe has a history of Indigenous activism which has, at times, grabbed global headlines.
During her swearing in ceremony in 2022, the Gunnai, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung woman referred to the Queen Elizabeth II as a coloniser - and was asked to retake her oath after facing criticism.
Last year, Australia decisively rejected a proposal to grant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people constitutional recognition and allow them to establish a body to advise parliament on issues impacting their communities.
The referendum - known as the Voice - became ensnared in a bruising campaign, and both sides of politics have sought to move on swiftly, leaving uncertainty over future policy.
While the data suggests a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn’t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading ‘No’ campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic.

Text: Veteran Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been charged with sexually abusing seven men and a 17-year-old boy.
The 83-year-old was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment early on Monday morning, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices.
Mr Jones is one of Australia’s most influential media figures, and has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023.
He now faces 24 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault.
All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences.
Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio titan personally, and that at least one had been employed by him.
Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters.
"I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. [They] have now got the ability to have a voice. This is what they've been asking for," he said.
Commissioner Karen Webb earlier said police had conducted a "very complex", "protracted" and "thorough" investigation, and expected other alleged victims may now come forward.
"There's no such thing as a matter that's too old to be investigated," she said at a press conference.
"You will be listened to, and we will take your matter seriously."
Mr Jones has been granted conditional bail, and will face court on 18 December.
A former teacher, Mr Jones coached Australia's national rugby union team between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career.
He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics.
A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues.
The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy.
He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had "died of shame", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should "shove a sock" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern.
Mr Jones has also been successfully sued for defamation many times.

Text: A cap worn by Australian cricket legend Sir Donald Bradman is expected to fetch up to £200,000 when it goes up for auction next month.
Bradman wore the cap - known as a 'baggy green' - in the 1947-48 home Test series against India, during which he scored his 100th first-class century.
Bradman, who died aged 92 in 2001, is widely regarded as cricket's greatest-ever batter and averaged 99.94 runs across his 52-match Test career.
The cap has been on loan since 2010 to the Bradman Museum in the player’s hometown of Bowral.
Following the 1947-48 Indian tour, Bradman gave the cap to the Indian team tour manager, Pankaj Gupta, who passed it on to the Indian team's wicket keeper PK Sen.
It was purchased by the current owner in 2003, auction house Bonhams said.
"The baggy green has been part of cricket and sporting heritage for decades," explained Alex Clark, a senior specialist at Bonhams.
"This very special baggy green promises to have real appeal to followers of cricket and sport generally, and anyone with a keen interest in the history of sport."
It will go on sale at Bonhams Sydney on 3 December.

Headline: Bondi attacker stabbed 16 in three minutes, inquiry told

Text: It took just three minutes for Joel Cauchi to fatally stab six people and injure 10 more during a rampage at a popular Sydney shopping centre, an inquest into the attack has been told.
The New South Wales Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday that Cauchi, 40, was knife-obsessed and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but had come off his medication and was homeless at the time of the incident.
The inquiry also heard that no alarm sounded inside the centre until after Cauchi had been shot dead by police.
The incident on 13 April devastated Australia, where mass murder is rare, and prompted a national conversation about gendered violence.
All up, 14 of the 16 people stabbed that day were female - including five of the six who were killed, and a nine-month-old baby. The NSW police commissioner said at the time that it was "obvious" Cauchi had targeted women.
Tuesday's hearing laid out the areas of focus for an extensive inquiry which is due to begin in full in April 2025. The investigation will look into possible security lapses and failings in the mental health systems in NSW and Queensland, Cauchi's home state.
Speaking in court, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, the counsel assisting the coroner, said Cauchi had been off his psychotropic medication since 2019, despite authorities being repeatedly warned of his deteriorating state. Cauchi had come "to the attention" of Queensland police several times, she added.
In her statement, Dwyer also provided the first detailed timeline of how the violence actually unfolded in Bondi that day.
She said that Cauchi - who had been sleeping rough in the suburb of Maroubra on the morning of the attack - entered Westfield shopping centre around 15.30 (local), and began stabbing people roughly three minutes later, after removing his knife in line at a bakery.
His first victim was Dawn Singleton, 25, followed by 47-year-old Jade Young and 25-year-old Yixuan Cheng. He then attacked Ashlee Good, 38, from behind.
Good - who has been described by her family as an "all-round outstanding human" - then saw Cauchi stabbing her nine-month-old baby girl in her pram, and was further wounded trying to save the child's life, the court heard.
Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old security guard, was stabbed next, alongside a colleague. Onlookers at the time said he died "trying to save others".
Cauchi fatally stabbed Pikria Darchia, 55, before being shot dead by NSW Police Insp Amy Scott, who had been on duty close by. Between the moment Insp Scott arrived and the moment she killed Cauchi just over a minute had passed, the court heard.
In total, the attack lasted for five minutes and 43 seconds - yet no alarm sounded during that time.
"It’s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound," Dwyer said.
Before opening the hearing, state coroner Teresa O’Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss the broader community was still feeling as a result of the violence.
"I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can’t be here in person," she told the court, according to the Guardian Australia.
"It’s important to me and my assisting team… that you feel safe, you feel heard and you feel cared for throughout this proceeding."

Headline: Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale

Text: Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has pulled his new children's book from the shelves after complaints it stereotyped Indigenous Australians.
The 400-page fantasy novel, Billy and the Epic Escape, features an Aboriginal girl with mystical powers living in foster care who is abducted from her home in central Australia.
First Nations leaders have said the book reproduces "harmful stereotypes" and trivialises the "complex and painful" history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being forcibly removed from their families under government assimilation policies.
Oliver - who is in Australia promoting a new cookbook - has apologised and said he was "devastated" to have caused hurt.
"It was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue," he said in a statement.
Publisher Penguin Random House UK said that a consultation with Indigenous Australians requested by Oliver had not happened due to an "editorial oversight".
Critics said the book contained language errors and oversimplified the identity of First Nations character Ruby.
"This superficial treatment of Ruby's character dehumanises her, and by extension, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples," said Sharon Davis of the First Nations educational body Natsiec.
Among the complaints is that Ruby is given the ability to read people’s minds and communicate with animals and plants, because "that’s the Indigenous way".
Sharon Davis said that reduced "complex and diverse belief systems" to "magic".
The character is also at the centre of an abduction plot, something community leader Sue-Anne Hunter called a "particularly insensitive choice," given the "painful historical context" of Australia's Stolen Generations.
During the 20th Century, tens of thousands of Indigenous children were removed from their families under official government policies aimed at assimilation which assumed black inferiority and white superiority. This government policy continued officially until the 1970s.
"The story’s flippant approach to narrating the theft of a First Nations child dangerously trivialises the ongoing trauma associated with Australia’s violent history of child removal," Natsiec said.
They added that today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are 10 times more likely non-Indigenous children to be removed from their families into foster care or other systems.
Critics have also pointed out language errors in the book. The character is from Mparntwe or Alice Springs in the Northern Territory but uses vocabulary from the language of the Gamilaraay people of the states of New South Wales and Queensland.
Sharon Davis said this showed "complete disregard for the vast differences among First Nations languages, cultures, and practices".
Oliver said he and his publishers had decided to withdraw the book from sale around the world.
A statement from Penguin Random House UK added: "It is clear that our publishing standards fell short on this occasion, and we must learn from that."
Natsiec said it acknowledged and recognised their apologies and "swift action" in removing the books from sale.

Text: An Australian soldier has been posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross - the Commonwealth's highest military honour - for bravery during the Vietnam War.
The then 19-year-old Private Richard Norden ran into enemy fire to reach a wounded comrade and retrieve the body of another during a battle north-east of the capital, then known as Saigon, in 1968.
He survived the battle but died at the age of 24 in a traffic accident while on duty as a police officer in Canberra
More than 60,000 Australians - about a quarter of them conscripted - served in controversial Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973, as part of an allied force led by the US.
"Private Richard Norden is a true Australian hero... [He] demonstrated extraordinary courage and selflessness by putting his own life at risk to save and protect his fellow comrades," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said after the announcement, on Remembrance Day.
Pte Norden's company was ambushed by North Vietnamese Army soldiers on 14 May, 1968, with a scout immediately killed and the section Commander gravely injured.
Described as having a "complete disregard for his own personal safety", he ran forward under heavy enemy fire to reach the two soldiers and carried the severely wounded section Commander back to his group.
Himself seriously wounded by that point, Pte Norden then went back for the scout. Finding him dead, he then returned to the group to collect grenades before pushing into the battlefield for a third time, to clear the area so the scout's body could be recovered.
Australia's Governor-General Sam Mostyn said it was a "historic" day for the country and a "significant" moment for Pte Norden's family.
"We are honoured that His Majesty has approved the Victoria Cross for Australia for Richard, recognising his gallantry actions whilst serving in Vietnam," his widow, Robynn Freeman said in a statement.
A formal ceremony to present the medal to Pte Norden's family will take place at a later date, yet to be announced.
Like in many other allied countries, the war was very divisive in Australia and thousands of Australians protested against it.
By the time the conflict ended in 1975, an estimated three million Vietnamese people had died, with the US losing over 58,000 people and Australia 521.

Headline: 'Adult crime, adult time': Row as Australian territory locks up 10-year-olds again
Author: Katy Watson, Australia correspondent, Reporting fromDarwin

Text: 'Thomas' - not his real name - was 13 years old when he began his first stint in prison.
Following the sudden death of his father, he had robbed a shop in Australia’s Northern Territory (NT). He was detained for a week but, within a month, he was back in custody for another burglary.
Five years on, the Aboriginal teenager has spent far more of that time inside prison than out.
“It’s hard changing,” Thomas tells me. “[Breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it’s hard to [stop] the habit.”
His story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the Northern Territory.
For many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer.
The Northern Territory is the part of Australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average.
It’s also more than twice the rate of the US, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars.
But the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10.
The move, which defies a UN recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people.
It's not just an issue of incarceration. It's one of inequalities too.
While around 30% of the Northern Territory's population is Aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are Indigenous.
So, Aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws.
The Country Liberal Party (CLP) government says it has a mandate after campaigning to keep Territorians safe. It helped the party claim a landslide victory in August's elections.
Among those voting for the CLP was Sunil Kumar.
The owner of two Indian restaurants in Darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action.
"It's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun," explains Mr Kumar.
He says he’s improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over.
"How come they are out and parents don't know?” he says. “There should be a punishment for the parents."
But while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers.
Youth offender rates have risen since Covid. Last year, there was a 4% rise nationally.
But the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the Northern Territory, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show.
Politicians, though, are playing to residents’ fears.
As well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as Declan's Law, after Declan Laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault.
"I never want another family to experience what we have,” said his mother Samara Laverty.
"The passing of this legislation is a turning point for the Territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place."
On the day the laws started to be debated in Darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide.
One woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. Another asked: 'What if it was your child?'
"Our young people in Don Dale need to have opportunity for hope," said Aboriginal elder, Aunty Barb Nasir, addressing the demonstrators.
She was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside Darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in Australia and led to a royal commission inquiry.
"We need to always stand for them because they are lost in there," Aunty Barb said.
Kat McNamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill, told the crowd: "The idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt."
After a ripple of applause, she added: "We are not going to stand for it."
But with a large majority in parliament, the CLP easily managed to pass the laws.
Lowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12.
And while other Australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory.
Australia is not alone – in England and Wales, for instance, it is also set at 10.
But in comparison, the majority of European Union members make it 14, in line with UN recommendations.
The Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Lia Finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can "intervene early and address the root causes of crime".
“We have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time,” she said last month.
"And we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more."
But for people like Thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. His crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased.
He says he finds prison oddly comforting. It's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity.
"Most of my family has been in and out of jail. I felt like I was at home because all the boys took care of me."
His two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. At one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week.
Thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now – his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager.
He's been helped by Brother 2 Another - an Aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports First Nations children caught up in the justice system.
"Locking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it," says Darren Damaso, a youth leader for Brother 2 Another.
"There needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards Aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. And then we're going to slowly start to see change. But if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work."
Mr Damaso is from the Larrakia Aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of Darwin, and he also has connections to the Yanuwa and Malak Malak people.
His organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym.
Brother 2 Another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with.
"It's a self-perpetuating cycle,” says John Lawrence, a Scottish criminal barrister who's been based in Darwin for more than three decades.
He's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place.
Aboriginal people “have no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm", says Mr Lawrence.
"The fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.”
The tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the Northern Territory.
In Queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the Liberal National Party played heavily on its slogan: “Adult crime, adult time.”
In a recent report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, Anne Hollonds, the National Children’s Commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them First Nations children - the country is creating "one of Australia's most urgent human rights challenges".
“The systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps,” she said.
“We cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer.”
Which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place.
"What are the cultural strengths of people? What are the community strengths of people? We are building on that,” says Erin Reilly, a regional director for Children's Ground.
Her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the Aboriginal 'kinship’ system - how people fit in with their community and family.
“We centre Indigenous world views and Indigenous values and we work in a way that works for Aboriginal people,” explains Ms Reilly.
“We know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people."
For Thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. But on the outside, he says, there’s little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through.
"I felt like no one cared. Nobody wanted to listen," he says.
He points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: "So, I hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?"

Headline: Sydney identifies 'disgusting' balls that shut beaches

Text: Australian scientists have solved a mystery which has gripped Sydney: what were the sticky dark blobs which washed up on some of the city's famed beaches last month?
Initially believed to be tar balls, they were in fact a "disgusting" combination of human faeces, cooking oil, chemicals and illicit drugs, researchers say.
Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of the black deposits started appearing from 16 October.
Testing by chemists has determined the balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill, though their exact origin remains unknown.
Last month authorities in New South Wales (NSW) said they suspected the objects were a mixture of fatty acids, fuel oil and chemicals found in cleaning and cosmetic products.
But further testing found the material is unlikely to have originated solely from an oil spill or waste from a ship, as some had thought.
Each ball was slightly different but had a firm surface - hardened partially by accumulating sand and minerals like calcium - and a soft core.
Inside was everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs.
"They smell absolutely disgusting, they smell worse than anything you've ever smelt," lead investigator Associate Professor Jon Beves, from the University of NSW, told 9News.
Professor William Alexander Donald said they resembled fat, oil, and grease blobs - often called fatbergs - which are commonly formed in sewerage systems.
Detecting this along with recreational drugs and and industrial chemicals had "pointed us to sewage and other sources of urban effluent", he explained.
The researchers said they had received unconfirmed reports of smaller but otherwise similar balls washing up over the past two years.
Sydney Water has reported that there are no known issues with waste systems in the city.

Headline: Australia plans social media ban for under-16s
Author: Hannah Ritchie, BBC News, Sydney
Published Date: 2024-11-07T00:59:31.257Z
Text: Australia's government says it will introduce "world-leading" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the "harm" social media was inflicting on Australian children.
"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back," he said.
While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.
There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.
Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.
The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.
While a lot of experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are sceptical over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.
Some researchers argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.
Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.
One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as "too blunt an instrument".
In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing "safety standards" on social media platforms.
The group also pointed to UN advice that "national policies" designed to regulate online spaces "should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it".
But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content, misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.
A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are "not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely" until at least 16, and that currently "excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness".
When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it "assumes an equal power relationship".
"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old," he told reporters on Thursday.
"These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour."

Headline: Raygun retires from breaking after Olympic backlash

Text: Australian breaker Rachael Gunn has announced she will retire from competition, citing the viral response to her performance at the Paris Olympics.
Gunn - who is known as B-girl Raygun - failed to get on the scoreboard in all three of her competition rounds in August, with a routine that included unorthodox moves, such as the sprinkler and a kangaroo hop.
The 37-year-old university lecturer's moves catapulted her to global attention and ridicule, spawned conspiracy theories about her qualification, and reignited criticism of breaking's inclusion in the Olympics.
Gunn had initially planned to keep competing but said the saga had been so "upsetting" that she changed her mind.
"I just didn’t have any control over how people saw me or who I was," she told local radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday.
"I was going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems really difficult for me to do now.
“I think the level of scrutiny that’s going to be there, and people will be filming it, and it will go online."
Gunn received a torrent of violent messages after the Olympics, and was the subject of an anonymous petition demanding she apologise. It falsely accused her and her husband of manipulating her selection at the expense of other Australian talent.
She was vigorously defended by Olympic officials, but her performance split opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the sport.
It also revived questions over whether breaking - which debuted in Paris but is not on the programme for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles - should have ever been included in the Olympics, due to the creative nature of the genre, which doesn't necessarily suit organised competition.
Gunn has previously said the backlash took the joy out of the sport for her, which she again alluded to on Wednesday.
"Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don’t think people should feel crap about the way that they dance.
"I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that’s like in my living room with my partner!"

Text: Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia and bronchitis for more than three weeks, has shown a "good response" to treatment, the Vatican has said.
"The clinical condition of the Holy Father in recent days has remained stable and, consequently, indicates a good response to the treatment," the Vatican said.
"There is therefore a gradual, slight improvement", it added.
The 88-year-old prayed on Saturday morning in the chapel of the papal suite at Rome's Gemelli Hospital, where he is being treated.
The Argentine pontiff has not been seen in public since entering the hospital, his longest stretch away from the public eye since his papacy began 12 years ago.
He was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties - and first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.
He is particularly vulnerable to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal.
The Pope's doctors believe he is likely to face a long road to recovery, due to his age and medical history.

Headline: Russian strikes kill at least 25, Ukraine says

Text: At least 25 people have died in Ukraine in the latest wave of Russian strikes, Ukrainian officials say, as the conflict shows no sign of easing.
One attack on Donetsk Region killed at least 11 people and wounded 40, including six children, local officials said on Saturday. Homes and infrastructure were hit in other regions, including Kharkiv and Odesa.
Russian attacks have intensified in recent days, as the US paused military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. It followed last week's Oval Office clash between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.
After the latest Russian strikes, Polish PM Donald Tusk said: "This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians."
"More bombs, more aggression, more victims," he added in a social media post.
The deadliest strikes occurred late on Friday in the Donetsk Region town of Dobropillya. At least 11 people were killed when two ballistic missiles hit eight residential buildings and a shopping centre, officials said.
After emergency services arrived, Russia launched another strike "deliberately targeting the rescuers", Zelensky said in a Telegram post. "Such strikes show that Russia's goals are unchanged," he added.
Other attacks in the region killed nine people and wounded 13 on Friday and Saturday, local officials said.
Drones struck a company in Bohodukhiv, Kharkiv Region, killing three people and injuring seven early on Saturday, regional head Oleh Synyehubov reported.
Another drone attack on Friday hit civilian and energy infrastructure in Odesa, the regional head said. "This is the seventh attack on the region's energy system in three weeks," the DTEK energy company said.
Meanwhile Ukraine has continued to target Russia, whose defence ministry said its forces had intercepted 31 Ukrainian drones overnight.
On Friday, Trump said he was finding it "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine" than Russia in attempts to broker peace between the two nations.
The US is "doing very well with Russia", and "it may be easier dealing with" Moscow than Kyiv, he told reporters.
Hours earlier, Trump had said he was "strongly considering" large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire with Ukraine was reached.
In addition to halting military and intelligence help, the US suspended Ukraine's access to some satellite imagery, space technology company Maxar said on Friday.
The move came exactly a week after the extraordinary exchange at the White House, in which Trump berated Zelensky for being "disrespectful" to the US.
The Trump administration's overtures to Putin have left many in Europe concerned that the continent will not be able to rely on US support for its security.
On Thursday EU leaders met in Brussels to approve plans to spend more on defence and renew the bloc's support for Ukraine.
Next week Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is due to hold talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Saudi Arabia to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire with Russia.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and now controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.

Headline: I'm lucky to be alive, says journalist tracked by Russian spies
Author: Daniel De Simone, Investigations correspondent
Published Date: 2025-03-08T04:36:44.386Z
Text: A journalist targeted by a Russian spy cell run from a former guest house in Norfolk has said he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered the operation against him.
Roman Dobrokhotov, editor-in-chief of The Insider, was followed through Europe by Bulgarian spies who were working for Moscow - three of whom were convicted on Friday.
Dobrokhotov told the BBC: "I'm very lucky to be alive".
The Russian national believes he and his fellow investigative journalist, the Bulgarian Christo Grozev, were targeted because of their exposés on Russia. They revealed Russia's role in a string of deadly incidents, including the nerve agent attacks in Salisbury in 2018 and on the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020.
In December 2020, on the day that investigative group Bellingcat published its exposé on the Navalny poisoning, the man who directed the Russian spy cell sent a message saying: "We'd be interested in a Bulgarian guy working for Bellingcat Christo Grozev."
Jan Marsalek, who instructed the spy ring on behalf of the Russian intelligence services, wrote that Grozev was the "lead investigator in the Navalny case".
His friend and fellow target Dobrokhotov said this was the moment when they became a major focus, as Putin was so disturbed by what had been revealed.
"I think that it was Putin directly," he said.
"In this dictatorship, you would never take responsibility on your own to do such a political stuff. You will always have a direct order from the president."
A message sent by Marsalek to fellow spy Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - demonstrated inside knowledge of Putin's thinking. He wrote: "Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him."
After 2020, the spy cell followed Grozev and Dobrokhotov throughout Europe, spying on them on aeroplanes, in hotels and in private properties.
They discussed kidnapping and even killing the men. There was talk of smuggling Dobrokhotov out of the UK in a small boat from the Norfolk coast, after which he would be taken back to Russia.
Dobrokhotov said it was clear this would have resulted in his death.
It was in January 2023, the month before police arrested members of the cell in the UK, that Dobrokhotov said he was "warned that I shouldn't leave the country because it can be dangerous".
He had not realised that he was being followed by the Bulgarian spies, who got so near to him on one flight that they saw the Pin code for his mobile phone.
He thinks the police action sends a signal.
"Vladimir Putin doesn't understand messages in words, only in actions," Dobrokhotov said.
"So he understands messages like, for example, Ukraine got long-range missiles. That's a message that he can understand.
"And when his spies are arrested and imprisoned for a big sentence, that's also a message that he can understand."
He thinks the use of Bulgarians working in normal jobs shows the limits of Russian espionage after so many professional spies were expelled from the West, but that spy cells like the Bulgarian one are no less dangerous.
Speaking about what motivates him, Dobrokhotov said he wants "to change Russia" because he does not want to live in a country that "kills people just because they're doing journalism or because they are criticising the government".
He said that "while we are existing, it is very difficult for Vladimir Putin to feel strength inside the country" and that "we will be someone who he will try to eliminate for the rest of his life".
"We're in a situation that only some of us will survive, either we or Vladimir Putin and his team."
On Friday Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to spy, while Roussev, 47, and Biser Dzhambazov, 43, had previously admitted the same charge. A sixth Bulgarian, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, pled guilty to spying. Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents.

Headline: Paris train services slowly resume after WW2 bomb defused

Text: An unexploded World War Two bomb found near Gare du Nord station in Paris was defused on Friday after trains to and from the station - one of Europe's biggest - were cancelled.
All Eurostar international services to and from the station were halted. Eurostar said its services would be back to normal on Saturday, and two extra return train journeys to London and Brussels had been added.
Local rail traffic resumed on Friday evening at Gare du Nord, but the French operators SNCF and RATP said the schedule remained disrupted.
French police evacuated 200 people from homes in Saint-Denis and temporarily closed part of the suburb's main ring road.
The 500kg bomb was found two metres deep at a building site north of Gare du Nord, where rail workers were putting up a new bridge over the railway lines.
Eurostar's Chief Safety and Stations Officer Simon Lejeune said the situation was "complex" and it was the "better option" to cancel all 32 services between London and Paris because it would give passengers "clarity" amid the "uncertainty".
He said he was "incredibly sorry" for the travel disruption and the issues customers had faced accessing the Eurostar app.
He told travellers they should be able to access the website to change their booking, get a refund or get a voucher.
The bomb was discovered 200m away from the busy Paris périphérique, about 2.5km (1.5 miles) north of Gare du Nord, Europe's busiest train station.
A nearby short northern stretch of the ring road and the A1 motorway were shut around Porte de la Chapelle. Traffic jams were recorded on 218km of roads in the Paris region.
Authorities in Saint-Denis said there were six schools and a care facility for elderly people inside the evacuation zone, but they were not at risk, because they did not have windows overlooking the area.
Homes with windows in a 500m (1,600ft) radius of the bomb were evacuated.
Eurostar services were running normally between Brussels and Marne-la-Vallée to the east of Paris as well as trains between London and Brussels and London and Amsterdam.
High-speed TGV trains into Gare du Nord were also badly hit, although some services were diverted to Gare de Lyon in Paris.
The railyards around occupied Paris were regular targets for British and American bombers during World War Two, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports.
Eurostar said passengers would be able to exchange their tickets for free to travel at another date or time in the same class, subject to availability.
"Eurostar will run two additional trains [on Saturday]: a train leaving London for Paris in the morning, and a train leaving Paris for London in the afternoon," it said in a statement.
Queues were beginning to form by 08:30 GMT at St Pancras train station in London as passengers tried to work out what they could do.
One group was approaching the front of the line after a two-and-a-half hour wait.
Their 07:00 GMT train was cancelled and they planned to travel to Lille and make a three-hour bus journey to Paris.
Jess Sayer from Norwich told the BBC on Friday morning that she was stuck in Paris with her husband and best friend after celebrating her 40th birthday on Thursday.
"We're frantically on our phones trying to find out what to do," she said, explaining they had not been able to book a train for Saturday via the website.
"We just tried to get a flight. All the flights are booked up so at the moment we are completely stuck in Paris with no way of getting home," she said. "Do we get a hotel and risk trying to get the Eurostar home tomorrow? Or look into ferries?"
Her friend, Sarah Fitzgerald, said she was trying to get back to London to help her family prepare for a funeral on Monday.
The Paris cancellations coincided with the middle of Paris Fashion Week and meant that personal shopper Anna Griffiths was unable to travel to Paris for a function.
"We work with all of the designer brands, and Chloé Fashion House had invited me to Paris for their show and a showroom event and a big dinner tonight," she said.
Ivana Koralek told the BBC she had decided to cancel a trip to see her elderly mother and nephew in France.
She said she had been unable to rebook for three weeks' time because ticket machines in the station did not offer the discount she had originally received.
Karen Hamblin, from Chester, had travelled to London on Thursday evening to catch a Friday train to Paris for a three-day getaway to celebrate her husband's birthday.
She said she was told at about 07:00 that their train was cancelled.
"As we were effectively stranded, we have decided to transfer our ticket and travel to Lille," she said. "Lunch in Lille and [we'll] then work out how to get to Paris from there!"

Headline: Pair who murdered man thrown over cliffs jailed for life
Author: Kevin Sharkey, BBC News NI Dublin reporter
Published Date: 2025-03-07T21:28:46.146Z
Text: The family of a man who was thrown over iconic Irish cliffs have described his "evil" murder as "callous and unnecessary".
Alan Vial and Nikita Burns, were convicted of murdering 66-year-old Robert Wilkin by majorities of 10 to two at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin on Thursday.
The pair were sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday.
Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal and Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both denied the murder.
The body of Mr Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, was found in the sea at the bottom of the cliffs at Slieve League, eight days after he was murdered on 25 June 2023.
During the sentencing hearing, a statement on behalf of Mr Wilkin's family described the time since his murder as "an agonising journey filled with grief, denial and undoubtedly anger".
The statement, read to the court by Mr Wilkin's sister Irene McAleer on behalf of herself, her brother David and sister Marie, stated that "the brutal nature of his death is something that none of us will ever come to terms with".
Commenting on her daily attendance at the trial at Dublin's Central Criminal Court, Mrs McAleer said "nothing or no one could have prepared me for the evil and harrowing details".
Her statement added: "To sit in the same room with those two cold, calculating individuals has been so difficult.
"The fact neither of these individuals have shown a grain of remorse has been very overwhelming at times."
Her family also paid tribute to the Garda (Irish police) investigation into the murder of their brother and thanked key witnesses "for their bravery in coming forward and appearing in court".
Ms McAleer also added: "I'd like to take this opportunity to declare that contrary to reports that Robin was estranged from his family, he was in fact just travelling his own path and had lost regular contact with us, as many siblings do.
"Robin's callous and unnecessary murder has deprived us all the chance to reconnect now that our own lives are slowing down," she said.
The statement concluded: "As a family, this isn't the end for us. Our grieving will begin now in whichever way we can navigate through it."
Speaking to BBC News NI , Ms McAleer said it had been a "few very hard days".
"I wasn't going to let it break me ... I couldn't have people thinking his family hadn't come looking for him," she added.
Mr Wilkin and his two killers had only known each other for a number of weeks.
They had spent an evening drinking together in local pubs in the hours before his murder.
After leaving a pub in the village of Dunkineely they were driving back to Vial's home, where all three had lived together at times, when a row broke out and Mr Wilkin was beaten on the head with a rock.
He was then driven about 14 miles along the coastline to the renowned Slieve League cliffs.
During the murder trial, Vial explained what happened when he admitted that he drove to Slieve League "to get rid of the body" in the early hours of the morning.
"We got him up onto the fence and then we dropped him to the other side, and he rolled from there off the edge of the cliff," he said.
The killer, who was described by his barrister during the trial as "a petty criminal and an alcoholic", also said they returned to the scene twice to see if the body was visible or "if anyone had noticed anything".
The court heard that Burns had "a difficult upbringing".
The search for Robin Wilkin's body led to a complex and challenging week-long air, sea and land search and recovery operation before his body could eventually be recovered from the treacherous Atlantic waters along the Slieve League cliffs.
The recovery of his body ensured that his two killers failed in their attempt to get away with murder.

Headline: Trump 'strongly considering' large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia
Author: Frank Gardner, Security correspondent, Tom Bennett, BBC News

Text: US President Donald Trump has said he is "strongly considering large-scale sanctions" and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal with Ukraine is reached.
Trump said he was contemplating the move because "Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now".
Trump's comments marked a sharp change in tone. Since coming into office, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraine's leader for not wanting peace with Russia.
Hours later, however, the US president told reporters he was "finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine", and repeated that he trusted Putin.
Last Friday, Trump berated Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Days earlier, he had even called him a dictator and blamed Ukraine for starting the war which began on 24 February 2022 when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighbouring country.
The public dressing-down was followed this week by Trump pausing all US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv.
It is not clear if this enabled Russia's large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Thursday night.
On Friday morning, Trump issued his threat of sanctions tariffs against Russia - apparently over the attack.
"They [Russia] are bombing the hell out of them [Ukraine] right now... and I put a statement out, a very strong statement 'can't do that, can't do that'," Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday.
Asked if that was a result of the US pause in military co-operation with Ukraine, Trump said Putin was doing "what anyone else would do".
And he justified the US move by saying: "I want to know they [Ukraine] want to settle and I don't know they want to settle."
In Friday's post, Trump wrote: "I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late."
He did not provide any details as to how such sanctions and tariffs against Russia may work.
Moscow is already under the heaviest Western sanctions in its history, many of which target its oil exports and foreign currency reserves.
It has been able to get around them to a large extent by selling discounted oil to India and China, while importing many of the goods it previously got from the West through countries like Kazakhstan.
China is reported to be helping to sustain Russia's war effort with large volumes of dual-use technology, which it denies.
The White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia. So it is possible that Trump's threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed.
The problem is, we simply do not know what was discussed and what was agreed in that "lengthy and highly productive" 90-minute phone call that Donald Trump suddenly announced he had held last month with the Russian president.
So far, Vladimir Putin has played a clever hand, sitting back and doubtless enjoying watching the transatlantic alliance come apart at the seams.
Compared to that gain, the threat of US tariffs is unlikely to bother him unduly.

The World War Two explosive, found near Gare du Nord station in Paris, was defused on Friday afternoon - with commuters being told to expect normal services on Saturday.
Eurostar's chief safety and stations officer Simon Lejeune said he was "incredibly sorry" for the travel disruption.
Five-year-old Daisy has a rare metabolic disorder called Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). She uses a wheelchair, is non-verbal and has severe epilepsy.
Ms Mannion travelled from Birmingham to London on Thursday with Daisy, her one-year-old daughter Lara, her mother and a friend.
"We've been planning this for such a long time. Make-A-Wish charity paid for everything from start to finish.
"We were really looking forward to making some special memories with the girls. I know Make-A-Wish will look to reorganise. But it's still a bit gutting really.
"I cried, we all cried. We've been really looking forward to it. Her [Daisy's] life is limited, we just never know how long we've got left with her.
"We wanted to make some really nice memories."
Many Britons found themselves stuck on the other side of the Channel on Friday, with no easy way of making it back to UK.
But some, like Vicky and her mother Jo, decided to "make the most of it" and spend a few more days in Paris.
"We were starting to get a bit worried about being able to get home eventually," said Vicky.
Vicky and her mother were only planning on staying one night, but have since decided to book a train back on Sunday.
"We're going to make the most of it. We just walked up to the Eiffel tower and are going to have a walk around the city, take our time and enjoy Paris," she said.
Many travellers complained about being unable to get on to the Eurostar app, including Bob and Mavis from Nottingham who had been hoping to travel to Paris from London St Pancras International on Friday.
"It's taken us hours to get through on the Eurostar app, because it keeps crashing", said Mavis.
The couple, who had finally managed to book a train to get them into Paris on Saturday, said they were having to spend money for a hotel in London overnight.

Headline: Poland announces military training plan for all men
Author: Adam Easton, BBC Warsaw correspondent

Text: Work is under way to make all men in Poland undergo military training, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.
In a speech to the Polish parliament, Tusk said the government aimed to give full details in the coming months.
Efforts are being made to "prepare large-scale military training for every adult male in Poland," he told the Sejm.
"We will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats."
Tusk said the Ukrainian army has 800,000 soldiers, whilst Russia has around 1.3 million and he wants to increase the size of the Polish army, including reservists, to 500,000 from around 200,000 now.
"We're talking about the need to have an army of half a million in Poland, including the reservists," he said.
"It seems if we organise things wisely, and I'm talking constantly with the Minister of Defence, we will have to use several courses of action. That means the reservists, but also intensive training to make those who do not go into the army fully-fledged and competent soldiers during a conflict," he added.
Tusk said women may also undergo military training, but "war, is still to a greater extent the domain of men".
The prime minister said his government was also "carefully examining" France's proposal to include Europe under its nuclear umbrella.
"I would like to know first of all in detail what it means in terms of the authority over these weapons," he said.
Tusk pointed out Ukraine was invaded after it got rid of its own nuclear arsenal, adding Warsaw would like to acquire its own nuclear weapons, however remote a possibility that may be.
"Today, it is clear that we would be safer if we had our own nuclear arsenal, that is beyond doubt. In any case the road to that would be very long and there would have to be a consensus too," he said.
Poland is already planning to spend 4.7% of its economic output on defence this year, the highest proportion in the Nato alliance.
Tusk told parliament that spending should increase to 5% of GDP.
Earlier, President Duda proposed amending the constitution to make defence spending at a level of 4% of GDP compulsory
The prime minister also said he supports Poland withdrawing from the Ottawa convention that bans the use of antipersonnel landmines, and also possibly from the Dublin convention that bans the use of cluster munitions.
Poland has ramped up defence spending since Russia's full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022.
It has signed arms contracts worth around $20bn (£15.5bn) with the United States to buy 250 M1A2 Abrams battle tanks, 32 F-35 jets, 96 Apache helicopters, Javelin missiles, and artillery rocket systems.
Warsaw has also signed contracts with South Korea to purchase K2 tanks and FA-50 light combat aircraft.
There is growing anxiety among Poles about their future security following US President Donald Trump's decision to suspend military supplies to Ukraine. Most Poles believe supporting Ukraine is in their own security interests.
Mirosław Kaznowski, the deputy mayor of Milanówek, a small town outside Warsaw, told BBC News this week that a friend of his has decided to invest in a start-up to build low-cost underground bomb shelters for businesses and homes.
His friend said interest was high, he added.

Headline: How spy ring did Russia's dirty work from the UK

Text: Roman Dobrokhotov is used to looking over his shoulder.
The Russian journalist's investigations into Vladimir Putin's regime - one of which unmasked the agents responsible for the 2018 Salisbury poisonings - have made him a target of the Kremlin.
But as the Insider editor waited on the tarmac to board a commercial flight from Budapest to Berlin in 2021, where he was to give evidence in a murder trial, he didn't notice the brunette woman stood behind him.
He thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording.
That morning, the woman had flown from Luton to Budapest to locate the mark. Dobrokhotov's flight information had been obtained in advance.
As the aircraft approached its destination, the woman, a Bulgarian – Katrin Ivanova – sent a message on Telegram.
Then two more.
Her partner, Biser Dzhambazov, with whom she lived in Harrow, north London, was waiting for her and Dobrokhotov in Berlin.
Another woman, an airport worker identified only as Cvetka, had already flown a dummy run of the route.
Waiting in Berlin, she was another pair of eyes.
They'd lost him.
Operational for years, the cell tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Its leaders plotted honeytraps, kidnap and murder in service of the Kremlin. Following a trial, three members were convicted on 7 March at the Old Bailey in London for their part in the conspiracy. Three more had already pleaded guilty.
"We're in a situation where only some of us will survive," Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC.
"It will be either Russian journalists and human rights watchers, or Vladimir Putin and his killers."
Watching events in Berlin unfold from the UK was the final member of the Telegram group, another Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, 47.
An associate recalls Orlin Roussev as a man fascinated by espionage. An email address associated with him includes the 007 sobriquet of the world's most famous secret agent.
He moved to Britain in 2009, before he set up a company involved in signals intelligence – the interception of communications or electronic signals.
When police officers searched the faded 33-room Great Yarmouth former guest house in which he lived with his wife and stepson, they discovered, in the assessment of one expert, "a vast amount of technical surveillance equipment which could be used to enable intrusive surveillance".
They might have been less dry. It was an Aladdin's cave disguised as a cluttered seaside relic; sophisticated communications interception devices worth £175,000; radio frequency jammers; covert cameras hidden in smoke detectors, a pen, sunglasses, even men's ties; a horde of fake identity documents and equipment to make more. An encrypted hard drive was left open. Telegram conversations were visible on Roussev's laptop.
Among the masses of equipment, police discovered the business card of a one-time finance executive, Jan Marsalek.
Roussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2015, introduced, he recalled, by a mutual acquaintance he had met at the offices of a British investor and wealth adviser. In emails from that time seen by the BBC, Marsalek enlists Roussev's help in acquiring a secure mobile phone from a Chinese company.
Then, Jan Marsalek was the respected chief operating officer of German payments processing company Wirecard. While reports criticising Wirecard's business practices had started to appear in the Financial Times, the company's reputation as a star performer in the European fintech sector, valued in excess of £20 billion at its peak, was intact.
Now, he was directing operations as Roussev's controller on the run from fraud charges - the subject of an Interpol red notice - following the company's 2020 collapse.
Together, the pair conceived operations targeting journalists, dissidents, politicians, even Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military installation in Stuttgart. They discussed selling US drones captured from Ukrainian battlefields to China. And they did it for Russia.
Linked to the state's intelligence services, Marsalek is believed to be hiding in Moscow. He faces no charges in the UK.
The group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination.
Alongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed "The Destroyer" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov.
A neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. They were too stupid and didn't know anything, the neighbour asserted, though they admired the fighter's "enormous calves".
But they were not ineffective – Roman Dobrokhotov recognised none of the group's faces when pictures were shown to him by police.
The group operated a clear hierarchy. Roussev reported to Marsalek, who reported to his "friends in Russia". Roussev managed the rest of the Bulgarians, who he referred to as his "minions", Dzhambazov chief among them.
"There are no bosses here," Dzambhazov wrote, as he issued instructions to Ivanchev.
Nonetheless, "minion" was attached to the decorator's number in Dzhambazov's phone.
The group dynamics were complicated. Dzhambazov and Ivanova were in a long term relationship and lived together. Gaberova and Ivanchev were in a relationship until 2022.
But it was Dzhambazov and Gaberova police found in bed together when they burst into the beautician's northwest London flat in February 2023.
Between August 2020 and February 2023, Marsalek and Roussev exchanged 78,747 messages on the Telegram messaging app.
They reveal at least six operations the spy cell was tasked with over a period of years – four of which targeted individuals who were enemies of Putin's regime.
As well as Dobrokhotov, the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev was watched at home in Vienna. Cameras in the window of a rented apartment nearby were trained on his front door.
He was tailed on flights and photographed in a Valencia hotel eating breakfast with co-founder of the Bellingcat investigative collective Elliott Higgins.
A thorn in the side of Russian intelligence services, he was observed in Bulgaria meeting with an arms trader who had been the victim of an assassination attempt Grozev linked to the Russian state.
Gaberova was instructed to befriend him.
In Montenegro, the cell searched for Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until he fell foul of the Kremlin. They were anxious to impress. A second Russian intelligence team circled, including a chain-smoking blonde woman referred to only as "Red Sparrow".
Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kachur. It wasn't an empty threat – a colleague of Kachur's had separately been taken to Moscow.
A former Kazakh politician living with refugee status in London, Bergey Ryskaliyev, was targeted at a luxury apartment in Hyde Park. Further reconnaissance took place at his home.
Ivan Stoyanov, who acknowledged his part in the conspiracy, was spotted parked in a Toyota Prius outside his address. Suspicious, an assistant of Mr Ryskaliyev noted the licence plate.
When confronted, the MMA fighter claimed he was working for a Kensington hospital, delivering tests. The next day, an NHS logo had been placed in the windscreen.
Prosecutors said providing information on a political dissident like Ryskaliyev "is predicated on Russian attempts to control diplomatic relations".
Indeed, Marsalek would further task Roussev with another project: a hare-brained scheme to initiate a staged protest at the Kazakh Embassy featuring blood dropped from drones, an astroturf human rights campaign involving Just Stop Oil, a letter addressed to the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, advertising on London buses and unrealised deepfake pornographic video of the Kazakh president's son. Russia would then help nervous Kazakh security services "uncover" the "activists" responsible.
In February 2022, Telegram exchanges between Marsalek and Roussev reveal a preoccupation with following Christo Grozev to Kyiv, where he was believed to have travelled.
Their offers to help were rebuffed.
Fewer than three weeks later, Russian tanks surged across Ukraine's eastern, southern and northern borders.
Later that year, Marsalek asked Roussev if one of the cell's three IMSI grabbers – sophisticated communications interception equipment – could be deployed to spy on Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. Roussev promised to retrieve it from his "Indiana Jones garage", where it was "gathering dust".
Marsalek returned to the idea repeatedly.
By February 2023, Roussev and Marsalek were plotting to send Dzhambazov and "one more person" to Stuttgart, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers to be training on Patriot missile systems.
Had they successfully deployed and captured Ukrainian troops' mobile phone data as planned, they might have used it to pinpoint those same troops on the battlefield – leading Russian forces to Western-supplied Ukrainian air defences.
"This was espionage activity of the highest level of seriousness," prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey.
Before their plans could be put into action, they were arrested – Dzhambazov, Ivanova, Gaberova and Stoyanov in London, Roussev in his guest house.
Though Ivanchev identified himself to police outside Gaberova's flat, he would not be arrested for another year.
In his first police interview, he told officers he had spoken to MI5 in the interim. The interview was paused.
None of the six denied their actions.
Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov pleaded guilty before trial. Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev denied knowing they were working for Russia.
The jury disagreed.
Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev were found guilty after the jury deliberated for over 32 hours. Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing multiple false identity documents.
They could face up to 14 years in prison. They will be sentenced in May.
But it is not the end.
"If there is no regime change, there will be new and new teams of people who come to kill or kidnap you," Roman Dobrokhotov told the BBC.
"This is this actually something that motivates us to work.
"From the very beginning, I was sure it was something directly controlled by Vladimir Putin.
"In his dictatorship you would never take responsibility on your own to do such political stuff.
"You'd always have a direct order from the president.
"Putin is a psychopath who has no borders," he said.

Headline: Trump celebrates Irish in America ahead of taoiseach's visit

Text: US President Donald Trump has hailed the impact of the Irish in America days ahead of Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin's visit to the White House to celebrate St Patrick's Day.
Trump signed a proclamation on Thursday declaring March "Irish-American Heritage Month".
March has been designated Irish-American Heritage Month every year since 1991, first by a law passed by Congress, and since 1997 by presidential proclamation.
In the proclamation, Trump said the month will "commemorate the special bond of friendship between the United States and Ireland" and "honor the extraordinary contributions of Irish-American citizens past and present".
Signing the proclamation, the president said the Irish were "great people", adding: "They voted for me in heavy numbers so I like them even more."
The proclamation describes Irish-Americans as "some of the toughest, most driven, and most devoted people on the face of the Earth".
"Their faith in God, love of family, and indelible commitment to our national promise continue to inspire citizens all across our country."
It is a month dedicated to recognising the contribution of Irish immigrants and their descendents to American society.
Every year, the US president issues a proclamation to mark the occasion.
Cultural events, exhibits and other educational programmes take place each March to highlight the achievements of Irish-Americans.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, millions of Irish immigrants moved from Ireland to the cities of Boston, Chicago, and New York "in hopes of a new frontier of opportunity and a better future for their families", the proclamation says.
It emphasises that Irish-Americans have played "a crucial role" in the "great American story" by "courageously overcoming adversity and hardship to embolden our culture, enliven our spirit, and fortify our way of life".
Irish-Americans have "fought for our freedom on the battlefield, served in our halls of government, and pioneered legendary businesses - leaving a lasting mark on their communities and our national identity", the proclamation continues.
"The United States and Ireland also enjoy a long friendship strengthened by economic ties, a shared commitment to democracy, and the timeless values of faith, family, and freedom.
"As my administration works to correct trade imbalances with the European Union, our historic relationship with Ireland presents an opportunity to advance fairer trade policies and stronger investment opportunities that benefit both nations."
Traditionally politicians from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland take part in engagements in the US around St Patrick's Day.
This usually culminates in the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) presenting a bowl of shamrock to the US president in the Oval Office.
Martin's meeting with Trump is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before St Patrick's Day.
Martin has said he will tell Trump that trade tariffs could cause damage to a "small open economy" like Ireland, according to Irish broadcaster RTÉ.
Speaking to reporters in Dublin, Martin said that he "will give our perspective" on the issue at the White House.
The taoiseach said there was "a two-way" nature to the economic relationship between Ireland and the United States and that he will listen to President Trump's perspective.
The Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly has confirmed she will also travel to Washington DC for the St Patrick's Day celebrations.
However, Sinn Féin has said it will not attend the annual festivities over Trump's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Alliance Party leader Naomi Long told her party's annual conference they were "taking a stand" by not attending, and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Claire Hanna said her party would also decline an invitation.

Headline: Paralysed man gets 'second chance at life' following surgery

Text: A County Mayo man who was paralysed in a car crash has been given a chance to live a "relatively normal life" thanks to what surgeons are calling ground-breaking surgery.
Yousaf Ghaffar was told he would never walk again following the collision in 2022.
At just 18, the student was paralysed from the waist down - until surgery last year.
Mr Ghaffar is now able to stand and walk several hundred steps with the aid of a robotic suit after doctors implanted a spinal cord stimulator.
Mr Ghaffar was injured outside Letterkenny, County Donegal, where he is a student.
He had joined his friend for a drive near the town when the car he was travelling in was involved in a crash.
He does not remember much about what happened.
"When I woke up, I tried to get out of the car, but I couldn't move my legs," he said.
"One second I had just finished college, and the next I'm being rushed to the hospital in Dublin."
When Mr Ghaffar asked a doctor if he would ever be able to walk again, he got a "disappointing look" in return.
"That's where I got my answer," he said.
"You always see people in wheelchairs. You never truly think of what would happen if you can't walk.
"I never thought of that before until this accident actually happened.
"You go from being a fully independent college student, to being completely dependent. It didn't feel real."
Unbeknown to Mr Ghaffar, consultant pain specialist Prof Kirk Levins was in the process of developing a surgical procedure that would change his life.
"The story started four years ago when I met a like-minded researcher at a conference in Barcelona," said Prof Levins.
He spent the next few years researching and developing the procedure.
"The way the surgery works is [a spinal cord stimulator] supplies that little bit of an extra boost to the spinal cord to make dormant pathways come alive again."
He added that the surgery had been "experimental".
"This was the first time this surgery has ever been done in this manner," he said.
During Mr Ghaffar's surgery rigid wire leads were inserted through an epidural needle to stimulate the spinal cord at a specific frequency and location.
The results were instant, said the surgeon.
"The biggest moment of my career was after the surgery when Yousaf was in the recovery bay," he said.
"We were trying to fine tune the device, and all of a sudden Yousaf started to move.
"That was the big 'wow' moment of this whole journey."
Since the operation, Mr Ghaffar has been relearning how to walk with the aid of an exoskeleton, but hopes one day he will be able to walk independently.
Staff at St Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin, where the procedure took place, believe it may be the first of its kind.
"No-one has ever reported a return of sensation and such a rapid return of movement as Yousaf has experienced," said Prof Levins.
"It has taken a long time to get here. Four years, meetings at three o'clock in the morning, it has been a busy time.
"The results are absolutely phenomenal."
Prof Levins said he hoped the procedure would mean that, for some people, paralysis would be a "temporary condition".
"The only barriers at this stage are further research, financial considerations and training of surgeons to do this," he said.
"It has the potential to change so many people's lives.
"It's great to be able to help people in such a dramatic fashion."
Mr Ghaffar said that, thanks to the operation, he could now live a "relatively normal life".
"I am driving, I go to college, I make friends, I go out with them. I do everything every able-bodied person is able to do," he said.
He said the surgery surpassed his expectations.
"It was one of those moments that you just can't describe. The way you feel, the emotions, you just can't explain."

It is the first time the 88-year-old has been heard by the public since entering hospital to be treated for bronchitis, before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.
The short, two-line message, recorded earlier that day from Rome's Gemelli Hospital, was played during a nightly prayer service for the pope in St Peter's Square at the Vatican.
Earlier this week the Vatican said the Pontiff was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure and had been using "non-invasive mechanical ventilation", but is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask.
The Pope has been forced to cancel a number events since his hospitalisation, most recently on Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of the six-week period leading up to Easter.

Headline: About 20 countries could join Ukraine coalition, UK says

Text: About 20 countries are interested in joining a "coalition of the willing" to help Ukraine, according to UK officials.
It is not thought every one of the countries, which are largely from Europe and the Commonwealth, would necessarily send troops but some could provide other support.
The plan, spearheaded by the UK and France, was set out by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at this weekend's summit of 18 European and Canadian leaders, and would work to uphold any ceasefire in Russia's war on Ukraine.
Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said such a move "can't be allowed" because it would amount to the "direct, official and unveiled involvement of Nato members in the war against Russia".
It comes as Kyiv attempts to mend relations with Washington after the US paused its military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing in a bid to bring President Zelensky to the negotiating table.
Speaking on a visit to a defence firm in Merseyside, Sir Keir said it would be a "big mistake" to think that "all we've got to do is wait for a deal now" between Ukraine and Russia, which US President Donald Trump claims to be attempting to broker.
The PM said it would be crucial that "if there is a deal - and we don't know there will be - that we defend the deal", which meant ensuring Ukraine was "in the strongest position".
But the PM stressed that defence plan should be made "in conjunction with the United States... it's that ability to work with the United States and our European partners that has kept the peace for 80 years now".
It is understood a meeting of officials was held on Tuesday to discuss providing security guarantees following any peace deal.
British officials said it was "early days" but welcomed what they described as the expressions of interest in joining a "coalition of the willing" as a "highly positive step".
The Prime Minister's Deputy Official Spokesman said the government had been "very clear that it is for Europe and for the UK to step up and I think you are seeing evidence of that consistently."
The UK and France have proposed a one-month truce "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure", backed up by a coalition of supportive western countries, but this has been rejected by Russia.
The UK announced a £1.6bn missile deal for Ukraine on Sunday and has now signed another deal with an Anglo-American security firm Anduril, to provide Ukraine with more advanced attack drones.
Also on Thursday, Defence Secretary John Healey held talks with his US counterpart Pete Hegseth in Washington DC.
At the meeting, Healey said the US had challenged Europe to step up on defence spending and the UK had responded.
"We have, we are and we will further," he said.
Hegseth said the UK was a "critical" partner, adding European leadership of the Nato alliance was "the future of defence on the continent".
Earlier, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed another security deal, worth nearly £30m and backed by the International Fund for Ukraine.
The deal will see Kyiv supplied with cutting-edge Altius 600m and Altius 700m systems - designed to monitor an area before striking targets that enter it - to help tackle Russian aggression in the Black Sea.
The announcement comes amid concerns that the US move to halt intelligence-sharing with Ukraine will affect the country's ability to use western weaponry and deprive it of advanced information about incoming threats.
In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, held an emergency defence summit as the EU grapples with the prospect of Trump reducing security assistance for Europe.
Proposing an 800 billion euro (£670 billion) defence package, von der Leyen said this was a "watershed moment", adding: "Europe faces a clear and present danger and therefore Europe has to be able to protect itself, to defend itself, as we have to put Ukraine in a position to protect itself and to push for a lasting and just peace."
European Union leaders met Zelensky, who thanked them for their support, and said: "We are very thankful that we are not alone. These are not just words, we feel it."
Turkey indicated Thursday it could play a part in peacekeeping efforts, while Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin said Irish troops could be involved in peacekeeping but would not be deployed in any "deterrent force".
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also said he is "open" to sending troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers.
On Thursday Russia rejected calls for a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova telling reporters: "Firm agreements on a final settlement are needed. Without all that, some kind of respite is absolutely unacceptable."

Headline: Five jailed over plot to kidnap German minister
Author: André Rhoden-Paul, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-06T20:28:04.524Z
Text: Five members of a German far-right group have been jailed for plotting to overthrow the government and kidnap its health minister.
Four of the group were described as "ringleaders" of a "terrorist organisation" which planned to use violence to trigger civil war-like conditions in Germany.
The group had planned to kidnap Health Minister Karl Lauterbach - an advocate of strict Covid-19 measures during the pandemic - and to kill his bodyguards if necessary.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the defendants had posed "an enormous threat" to national security.
The Koblenz higher regional court heard the group came together in January 2022 and devised a plan which included a sabotage attack to disable the power grid.
The group - made up of four men aged between 46 and 58 and a 77-year-old woman - had hoped they would be joined by disgruntled members of the security forces.
Four defendants described as ringleaders were sentenced to between five years and nine months and eight years in jail by a court in western Germany.
A fifth defendant received a two year and 10 month sentence following the almost two-year trial.
The identities of the five people convicted have not been publicly disclosed.
The group were associated with Citizens of the Reich whose followers believe the German Empire, which collapsed in 1918, continues to exist. Investigators say it was led by Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, a German aristocrat.
They are also said to have taken inspiration from the QAnon conspiracy theory movement, which is associated with some Donald Trump's supporters in the US.
After the verdict, Lauterbach - of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) - thanked the police and said the state had shown "it can defend itself against violent conspiracy theorists".
Faeser said: "The violent plans for a coup, for attacks on the electricity infrastructure, for the kidnapping of Health Minister Karl Lauterbach and for the killing of his bodyguards have shown an enormous threat."
She added that security services "take the threats posed by the Citizens of the Reich scene seriously and "we are protecting our democracy".
The sentencing follows several trials targeting far-right groups linked to Citizens of Reich which reject the legitimacy of the modern German state.

In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.
From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent – whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.
France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.
The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign – i.e. developed entirely by France – whereas the UK relies on US technical input.
On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could – in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.
His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering "sharing" its nuclear arsenal.
That – according to government officials as well as defence experts – is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be "shared".
According to Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent "is French and will remain French – from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president."
What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.
Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the "vital interests" of France were at stake.
The limits of these "vital interests" have always been left deliberately vague – ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.
In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.
So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.
What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.
"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond," says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.
"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato."
"But Trump has clarified the debate," Mr Laroche says. "It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent – let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now."
"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella."
Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.
How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.
According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.
Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.
Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not – but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.
Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that "vital interests" cover European allies too.
Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.
But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.
"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal," he says.
"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others – that helps create a solid front."

Headline: Pair found guilty of murdering man thrown over cliffs

Text: A man and woman have been found guilty of murdering a 66-year-old man who was thrown over cliffs along the Wild Atlantic Way.
Alan Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal and Nikita Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both denied the murder of Robert Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, on 25 June 2023.
The body of the County Tyrone man was found eight days later in the sea at the foot of Slieve League cliffs in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland.
It is not known if he was dead or alive when pushed.
His body was found following a search involving gardaí (Irish police), the Donegal Mountain Rescue Team and the Irish Coastguard.
The trial had previously heard Vial, Burns and Mr Wilkin had been drinking at various bars on the night of the murder.
CCTV footage shown during the trial showed a car travelling from McIntyre's Bar in Dunkineely to Roshine, which a prosecutor said was most likely the place where Mr Wilkin was assaulted.
The Irish state pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, had told the trial that she was unable to identify a cause of death due to the body's state of decomposition and the damage caused by the fall down the cliff face.
However, she did identify two depressed fractures to the back of the victim's skull which were not consistent with a fall down a cliff.
The prosecution case was that Mr Wilkin was beaten with a rock before being driven to Slieve League and put over the cliffs.
Prosecutors also said the victim was either thrown over the cliff "alive or dead".
They had argued that Burns and Vial acted together as a joint enterprise, meaning they were both equally responsible, regardless of who struck the fatal blow.
During the trial, the two accused each other of the murder.
The trial had been told that all three became friends just weeks before the murder and they had lived together at times in Vial's house in Killybegs.
Vial and Burns had been in a brief relationship in the time leading up to the killing of Mr Wilkin.
Vial, who was described by his barrister as "a petty criminal and an alcoholic", had pleaded not guilty to the murder.
Burns, who the court heard had "a difficult upbringing", also pleaded not guilty to murder, but she pleaded guilty to impeding the apprehension or prosecution of another person for an arrestable offence.
Mr Wilkin's body was discovered following a huge land, sea and air search along the County Donegal coastline involving search and rescue helicopters, boats, drones, the Irish defence forces, and a large number of people from local communities.
The search began after a car in which the two killers were travelling crashed the evening after the victim was murdered and Vial was arrested for drink driving.
The crash and Vial's arrest, along with admissions made by Burns to friends that evening, quickly led to a major police operation at the cliffs.
After a lengthy trial which began in January, the jury took just over eight-and-a-half hours across three days to reach their verdicts.
The seven women and five men found both Vial and Burns guilty of murder.
Burns and Vial will both be sentenced on Friday.

Headline: Pelicots' daughter presses charges against father jailed in mass rape case

Text: Caroline Darian, the daughter of Dominique and Gisèle Pelicot, is pressing charges against her father, accusing him of drugging and raping her - something he has always denied.
Last December, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail for drugging his ex-wife, Gisèle, raping her and inviting dozens of men to also abuse her over nearly a decade.
Pelicot filmed the rapes of his wife, collecting hundreds of videos he neatly catalogued on a hard disk.
Among them were also two photos of his daughter, in which Ms Darian, 46, says she is clearly unconscious, sleeping in an unfamiliar position and wearing underwear she doesn't recognise.
Dominique Pelicot has offered conflicting explanations for the photos, but has always denied sexually assaulting his daughter.
Ms Darian has long said the photos are proof her father also drugged and raped her.
"I know that he drugged me, probably for sexual abuse. But I don't have any evidence," she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time.
Police will now launch an investigation, and prosecutors will later decide whether to proceed to trial.
Béatrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was "unsurprising".
But she also pointed out that the prosecutors in the previous trial had said there were insufficient "objective elements" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter.
The heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world. "I never touched you, never," Pelicot pleaded to his daughter during one session. "You are lying!" Ms Darian shouted back.
Ms Darian has previously said she felt she was the trial's "forgotten victim" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted upon her.
She told Elle France earlier this week that the charges she is pressing against her father were "symbolic" but "in line with what I have said since the start: that I am a victim of chemical submission [drug-facilitated assault] but was never recognised as such".
She has hired lawyer Florence Rault to represent her.
For many years, Ms Rault has been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s.
One, a young property agent known by the pseudonym Marion, was the victim of an attempted rape in 1999, to which Pelicot has admitted.
The other - also an estate agent in her 20s - was raped and murdered in 1991. Pelicot is currently being investigated over that case, but has always denied any involvement.
Ms Darian said she saw similarities between her and Marion. "We look strangely alike. She is blonde, her hair is bobbed, we were born the same year... I wanted to meet her lawyer and hear all the details," she told Elle France.
In her police complaint, which was quoted by French media, Ms Rault lamented that Ms Darian had never been offered gynecological examinations nor had she been tested for the drugs Pelicot used on his wife.
Ms Rault said the investigation had only focused on Gisèle Pelicot and that her client had been treated as a "peripheral victim". She asked the authorities to launch a fresh "serious and in-depth" inquiry.
Forty-nine men were sentenced in December alongside Dominque Pelicot. All were found guilty of at least one charge - rape or sexual assault - against Gisèle Pelicot.
Seventeen initially said they would appeal the charges against them, but seven of those have since changed their minds.
Those who decide to press ahead with their appeals will go on trial at the end of the year in Nîmes, southern France.
The first trial - which lasted from September to December 2024 - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gisèle Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.

Headline: McGregor obeyed orders over Nikita Hand CCTV footage - judge

Text: A judge has said he is satisfied Conor McGregor has done what was ordered regarding the sharing of CCTV footage, which was shown during the civil trial brought by Nikita Hand.
In January, Judge Alex Owens ordered the former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter not to share the footage and to give back or destroy any copies.
The judge said the jury in the civil trial conclusively determined Mr McGregor raped Ms Hand in a Dublin hotel in December 2018.
He said it was not open to McGregor to selectively use evidence in the public arena to suit himself.
The footage showed McGregor, Ms Hand and two others, James Lawrence and Danielle Kealy, in the car park and lift of the Beacon Hotel in Dublin, before and after McGregor assaulted Ms Hand.
It was played to the court on multiple occasions during the trial and viewed by the jury during their deliberations.
McGregor had claimed Ms Hand did not look like someone who had been seriously assaulted in the footage.
Ms Hand became very upset when it was shown in court and said she was clearly very drunk in the footage.
On Thursday, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that lawyers for Ms Hand asked the judge to issue an injunction against McGregor, which they said would further restrain him from publishing or sharing the footage.
Ms Hand's senior counsel, John Gordon, said McGregor was not clear enough in his affidavits to the court and that he would have expected McGregor to address a specific issue about causing anybody to receive the footage.
Mr Gordon referred to a newspaper article which referenced a claim by an Italian business associate of McGregor, Gabriel Ernesto Rapisarda, who claimed after the trial that the imminent release of the footage would increase sales of McGregor's stout.
However, the judge said he had to rely on affidavits from people and, according to McGregor's affidavit, he had taken the steps asked of him and that any urgency in January had now blown over.
The judge said McGregor was the "author of his own misfortune" by sharing a social media post and that he was satisfied with the affidavits.
Senior counsel Remy Farrell, for McGregor, agreed with the judge that his client had done everything he was asked to do.
The judge awarded costs for this action against McGregor.
Ms Hand, who accused McGregor of raping her, took a claim against him and another man, Mr Lawrence, for damages in a civil case.
In the Irish courts, a civil action means - unlike a criminal case - there is no automatic anonymity for either the complainant or the accused.
McGregor was ordered to pay her more than €248,000 (£206,000) in damages after a jury found he had sexually assaulted Ms Hand.
The jury found that Mr Lawrence did not assault her.
Speaking outside the court following the decision, Ms Hand said her story was "a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be to speak up, you have a voice".
A judge later ruled that the MMA star must pay Ms Hand's legal costs.
Last month, McGregor lodged an appeal against the judgment that he assaulted Ms Hand.

Headline: Prosecutors demand Luis Rubiales World Cup kiss retrial

Text: Spanish prosecutors have demanded a retrial in the case of former football federation president Luis Rubiales, who was found guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent.
In February, Rubiales was fined €10,800 (£9,052) for that offence but found not guilty of coercion over allegations he pressured Hermoso into publicly saying the kiss was consensual.
Prosecutors have called for Rubiales to be jailed and appealed that verdict, seeking a retrial with a different judge after alleging the original was biased in Rubiales's favour.
Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips as Spain's players received their medals for winning the 2023 World Cup.
The incident, which occurred after Spain defeated England in Sydney, was witnessed by millions on television and in the stadium, and triggered protests and calls for Rubiales's resignation.
The 47-year-old previously said he will appeal against the guilty verdict.
Three of Rubiales's former colleagues were also accused of colluding in the alleged coercion.
Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning side, Rubén Rivera, the Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF)'s former head of marketing, and Albert Luque, former sporting director, were all cleared.
The court's ruling also banned the former football president from going within a 200m radius of Hermoso or communicating with her for one year.
During the trial, Rubiales told the court he was "absolutely sure" Hermoso had given her consent before he kissed her.
He described the kiss as an "act of affection", adding that in the moment it was "something completely spontaneous".
In her testimony, Hermoso insisted she had not given her consent and said the incident had "stained one of the happiest days of my life".
She told the court in Madrid: "My boss was kissing me and this shouldn't happen in any social or work setting."
The incident gave momentum to a Me Too-style movement in the Spanish women's game, in which players sought to combat sexism and achieve parity with their male peers.
Rubiales resigned in September 2023 following weeks of resisting pressure to stand down and after he was suspended by Fifa.
Prosecutors first filed a complaint from Hermoso about Rubiales to Spain's high court in the days prior to his resignation. He was formally charged in early 2024.

Headline: 'So lucky to be alive': Aid worker describes escape from deadly Russian strike

Text: A UK-based aid worker said he, his friends and colleagues were "so lucky to be alive" after they narrowly escaped a Russian missile attack on a hotel in central Ukraine on Wednesday night that left at least four dead.
Karol Swiacki, a Polish national and founder of the Bournemouth-based charity Ukraine Relief, was at the Central Hotel in Kryvyi Rih having dinner with friends when the missile struck.
"We are all safe we didn't have a scratch, it is incredible," he told BBC News, adding "we still don't know how we survived this, honestly."
Dnipropetrovsk regional head Serhiy Lysak said 32 people, including two children, were wounded in the attack on President Volodymyr Zelensky's hometown.
The charity worker - who has previously won a BBC award - is in Ukraine carrying out aid relief work including delivering sports equipment and renovating a school for 550 children.
He is also visiting shelters and orphanages with Ukraine Relief's trustee, Marc Edwards - a British national who now lives in the US.
The duo were having dinner with friends at the hotel restaurant at the time of the strike. The dining party included two US volunteers, two workers from a Ukrainian charity foundation, a young boy and his pregnant mother.
"We'd just put our stuff in our rooms and went to eat with our local Ukrainian contacts and the cell phone alarm went off so we ran to the shelter," said Mr Edwards.
Mr Swiacki added: "We took two steps and there was a big boom, absolute nightmare, everything just within seconds changed into a very apocalyptic news screams, alarms."
Video sent by Mr Swiacki to the BBC showed smoke filling the restaurant with half-eaten meals and takeaway boxes on tables.
"There was so much stuff that we couldn't see where we were going," said Mr Swiacki.
Mr Edwards confirmed that the blast "took out all the windows" and they had to climb out of the restaurant through a broken window.
The duo went back into the hotel to see if anyone else was hurt, and retrieve some of their belongings.
They also went outside to look for their vehicles, which were "full of aid" but were "all destroyed", Mr Edwards said.
Mr Swiacki's van, which he had parked outside the hotel, was "smashed completely to pieces".
"We heard some noises we don't want to hear again. Somebody was trapped under the rubble next to our van and didn't make it. Someone was hit from shrapnel and didn't make it. I'm numb," Mr Edwards said.
Mr Swiacki described the scene as "crazy, absolutely nightmare".
He said the restaurant was on the ground floor, and believes that it is the only room - or at least one of the few rooms - that didn't collapse.
The men are still in Kryvyi Rih and despite the shock of the explosion, Mr Swiacki said he has not been deterred him from continuing his aid work in Ukraine.
"I will never stop helping people after this," he said.
The attack happened ahead of a European security summit on Thursday which Zelensky is attending.
Reacting to the attack, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said it showed "why Ukraine needs defence capabilities: to protect human lives from Russian terror".

Headline: Irish economy grew at 'a solid pace' in 2024

Text: The Republic of Ireland's domestic economy grew by 2.7% in 2024, official figures suggest.
Irish domestic output is estimated using a measurement called modified domestic demand (MDD).
The economic performance of most countries is measured using gross domestic product (GDP), but Irish GDP is heavily distorted by the activities of multinational companies.
The figures suggest that Irish GDP grew by 1.2% in 2024.
Finance Minister Pascal Donohoe said the figures confirmed that "the domestic economy grew at a solid pace last year, marginally ahead of my department's forecast".
He added: "The growth in the domestic economy is consistent with the strength of our labour market – with a record 2.8m people in employment last year."
Donohoe warned that the increasingly uncertain global outlook could have negative consequences for Ireland which he described as "a major beneficiary of global economic integration".
The United States is Ireland's single biggest export market for manufactured goods, with sales of €72.6bn (£60.4bn) in 2024.
Those goods could be hit with import taxes, known as tariffs, if President Trump extends his protectionist trade measures to the EU.
Earlier this week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on goods entering the US from Canada and Mexico.
Donohoe's colleague, Public Expenditure Minister Jack Chambers, said there had been "extensive contingency planning" regarding tariffs.
"We know that tariffs will bring serious disruption, damage, and will undermine the international trading environment, which has been the backbone of the Irish economy," he told RTÉ radio.
"That's why there's scenario planning across all of the different possibilities which might emerge."

Headline: Denmark postal service to stop delivering letters
Author: Adrienne Murray & Paul Kirby, In Copenhagen & London

Text: Denmark's state-run postal service, PostNord, is to end all letter deliveries at the end of 2025, citing a 90% decline in letter volumes since the start of the century.
The decision brings to an end 400 years of the company's letter service. Denmark's 1,500 post boxes will start to disappear from the start of June.
Transport Minister Thomas Danielsen sought to reassure Danes, saying letters would still be sent and received as "there is a free market for both letters and parcels".
Postal services across Europe are grappling with the decline in letter volumes. Germany's Deutsche Post said on Thursday it was axing 8,000 jobs, in what it called a "socially responsible manner".
Deutsche Post has 187,000 employees and staff representatives said they feared more cuts were to come.
Denmark had a universal postal service for 400 years until the end of 2023, but as digital mail services have taken hold, the use of letters has fallen dramatically.
PostNord says it will switch its focus to parcel deliveries and that any postage stamps bought this year or in 2024 can be refunded for a limited period in 2026.
Fifteen hundred workers face losing their jobs, out of a workforce of 4,600.
"It's a super sad day. Not just for our department, but for the 1,500 who face an uncertain future," employee Anders Raun Mikkelsen told Danish broadcaster DR.
Denmark ranks as one of the world's most digitalised countries.
There's an app for almost everything: few people use cash, and Danes even carry drivers' licences and health cards on their smartphones.
Bank statements, bills, and correspondence from local authorities are all sent electronically.
Public services send communications via a Digital Post app or other platforms and PostNord Denmark says the letter market is no longer profitable.
Letter numbers have fallen since the start of the century from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year.
The decision will affect elderly people most. Although 95% of Danes use the Digital Post service, a reported 271,000 people still rely on physical mail.
"There are many who are very dependent on letters being delivered regularly. These include hospital appointments, vaccinations or decisions regarding home care," Marlene Rishoj Cordes, from Aeldre Sagen (DaneAge) told Denmark's TV2.
PostNord has weathered years of financial struggles and last year was running a deficit.
Danish MP Pelle Dragsted blamed privatisation for the move and complained the move would disadvantage people living in remote areas.
The introduction of a new Postal Act in 2024 opened up the letter market to competition from private firms and mail is no longer exempted from VAT, resulting in higher postage costs.
"When a letter costs 29 Danish krone (£3.35; $4.20) there will be fewer letters," PostNord Denmark's Managing Director, Kim Pedersen, told local media.
He said Danes had become increasingly digital and the decline in letter volumes had become so pronounced that it had fallen by as much as 30% in the past year alone.
PostNord also operates in Sweden. It is 40% Danish-owned and 60% Swedish-owned.

Headline: Europe's leaders hold Ukraine talks at 'turning point in history'

Text: EU leaders gathered in Brussels on Thursday for a special council on defence, as France's President Emmanuel Macron warned that the continent was at a "turning point of history".
As well as rearmament, leaders are expected to discuss how the body can further support Kyiv in the face of US President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that he would suspend military aid to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is invited to the summit.
Nerves have grown increasingly frayed across Europe since Trump and Zelensky's showdown at the White House last week, and the rhetoric around Thursday's summit leaves no doubt about the importance EU officials are ascribing to it.
Three years on since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Trump administration's overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin have left many in Europe concerned the continent would not be able to rely on US support for its security.
Washington's decision on Wednesday to pause intelligence sharing with Ukraine did nothing to allay those worries.
In a sign of the depth of concern, President Macron said France was open to discussing extending the protection offered by its nuclear arsenal to its European partners, during an address to the nation on Wednesday.
That followed a call from Friedrich Merz, likely to be Germany's next chancellor, to discuss increased nuclear sharing.
Europe was facing a "clear and present danger on a scale that none of us have seen in our adult lifetime", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said, while European Council President António Costa said this was a "defining moment for Ukraine and European security".
In a letter to European leaders, von der Leyen also said the continent had to "meet the moment" and "unleash our industrial and productive power and direct it to the goal of security".
On Monday, von der Leyen announced an unprecedented defence package - dubbed ReArm Europe - and said that Europe was ready to "massively" boost its defence spending "with the speed and the ambition that is needed".
Von der Leyen said the three proposals outlined in the ReArm Europe plan would both support Ukraine and "address the long-term need to take much more responsibility" for European security - probably referring to the fact many Europeans feel the continent can no longer automatically rely on the US to come to its aid.
The proposals include:
The European Investment Bank would also be allowed to finance military projects.
According to von der Leyen, the plan could free up a total of €800bn ($860bn; £670bn) in defence expenditure.
Many European leaders have signalled their support for swift, decisive action in regards to the continent's security.
Donald Tusk, Poland's prime minister, said the Commission's plan represented "a fundamental shift", while Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said that the summit would give Europe the opportunity to show "whether it's just a debate club or whether we can make decisions".
But dissent from certain European leaders sympathetic to Moscow is expected.
Earlier this week, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said the EU's "peace through strength" approach was "unrealistic".
And in a letter to Costa, Hungary's Viktor Orban demanded that Ukraine not be mentioned in any written conclusions following the summit.
Orban - who has repeatedly attempted to block EU aid to Ukraine and has praised Trump for "standing bravely for peace" - said there was now a "strategic divide... between the majority of Europe and the USA".
"One side insists on prolonging the war in Ukraine, while the other seeks an end to the conflict," he added.
Yet Orban left the door open for a "greater probability for co-operation" with other leaders over issues of common security and defence.
While Thursday's crisis summit is taking place in Brussels, UK Defence Secretary John Healey will be in Washington for discussions with his counterpart Pete Hegseth on the US decision to pause intelligence sharing with Ukraine.
Their bilateral meeting will focus on a possible peace plan while efforts continue to bridge a transatlantic rift over Kyiv's future security.
Perhaps in a final bid to try and achieve unity ahead of the summit, Macron - who has positioned himself at the centre of the EU's efforts to bridge the gap between Kyiv and Washington - invited Orban to have dinner in Paris on Wednesday evening.
The two leaders met immediately after the French president gave a sombre address to the nation in which he said that France and Europe needed to be ready if the US was no longer by their side.
"We have to be united and determined to protect ourselves," Macron said. He added that the future of Europe could not be tied to Washington or Moscow, and said that while he "wanted to believe that the US will stay by our side, we have to be ready for this not to be the case".
The French president plans to hold a meeting of European army chiefs in Paris next week.
Macron said that "decisive steps" would be taken in Brussels, leaving European countries "more ready to defend and protect themselves".
"The moment calls for unprecedented decisions," he concluded.

Headline: Taoiseach praises UK-Irish 'reset' ahead of joint summit

Text: A UK-Ireland summit marks a "major and significant manifestation" of a reset in relations between the two governments in the post-Brexit era, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin has said.
He met Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Wednesday evening, ahead of the summit on Thursday.
Speaking at an event on Wednesday, the prime minister said he hoped the evening would be an "early celebration of everything Irish and everything that binds the UK and Ireland together".
The summit is the first of its kind, it will be attended by cabinet members from both the UK and Irish governments in Liverpool.
It comes amid the backdrop of growing security concerns among the UK and EU countries about the influence of Russia.
On Thursday, the prime minister and taoiseach will host a joint business roundtable with industry leaders and businesses across tech, finance, clean energy, manufacturing and construction from the UK and Ireland.
The discussion will focus on potential opportunities for growth and investment, and how the UK and Ireland can work together to build an even more resilient and successful trading relationship.
They will also discuss how both countries can work closer together on renewable energy, tech, AI and security.
The two leaders are due to announce a new data sharing arrangement aimed at increasing the production offshore energy.
As part of the summit, Ireland will also announce new investments into the UK worth £185.5 million, which the UK government say could create more than 2,500 jobs across the country.
Ahead of the meeting, Martin paid tribute to the prime minister for "his leadership over the last while".
"He has been effective and impactful, we all want peace - there are too many wars in the world," he told reporters.
Meanwhile, Sir Keir said: "We can do much more when we work together with others and as I've said before, I don't believe that the relationship between the UK and Ireland has ever reached its full potential and I'm delighted that now, with this summit, we're going to change all of that. What an opportunity."
Asked if he would stand his ground with President Trump at events in Washington DC for St Patrick's Day next week, the taoiseach said his focus for now was the British-Irish relationship and that the Irish-US relationship remained important.
He also said he did not agree with comments by First Minister Michelle O'Neill after she said she was "incredulous" at the UK Government's decision to spend up to £1.6bn on defence missiles for Ukraine.
"I wouldn't agree with the first minister - no one likes the utilisation of weapons and all my life I've been on the peace side of the equation," he said.
"We don't live in an ideal world, one has to have capability to defend your country.
"But it's Russia who illegally invaded Ukraine, that's the reality... Europe needs to improve and enhance its capability in order to have a deterrence to avoid any encroachment on a member of the EU."
Sir Keir has previously expressed the importance of "resetting relation" between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Last September, he became the first British prime minister to visit the Republic of Ireland in five years.
Downing Street said the visit marked a "new era of co-operation and friendship" between Britain and Ireland.
The summit is expected to finish by mid morning on Thursday as the taoiseach is attending a special European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday afternoon.

Headline: Serbia's opposition under fire for smoke and flare protest in parliament

Text: The cleaners had scrubbed the debating chamber clean before MPs arrived for Wednesday's session in Serbia's National Assembly.
Spent smoke bombs, smears of egg yolk and a dusting of white fire extinguisher powder had all been removed from the benches and tables after the mayhem of the previous day.
The police had also been on the scene.
They were gathering evidence for potential criminal charges against the MPs who had plunged the parliament into a fug of pink and black smoke as they unfurled banners accusing the government of corruption.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic labelled the scenes "hooliganism". He said he was "looking for responsibility, criminal law" to be applied.
Three female MPs were hurt. One of them was hit on the back of the head by an object, although it was unclear who threw it, and another apparently suffered a stroke.
The EU said a parliament should be a place for democratic debate and that it was very concerned.
Opposition party MPs were unabashed.
The co-leader of the Green-Left Front, Radomir Lazovic, had let off a fire extinguisher from his seat in the chamber.
He described the intervention as "a response to the violence that has been perpetrated against the citizens of Serbia for 13 years".
That covers the period that the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has been in power.
Under the leadership of Vucic - who previously served as deputy prime minister and prime minister - the party has been an election-winning machine.
The SNS has emerged victorious from no fewer than five parliamentary elections since it first formed a governing coalition in 2012.
Its opponents claim that has more to do with the party's domination of Serbia's media outlets and state institutions than its policies.
But Vucic has successfully projected an image of strong, effective leadership that appeals to a large proportion of Serbia's electorate - particularly outside the main urban areas.
He has weathered plenty of protest movements over the years. All of them have fizzled out without dislodging the president or his party.
But the current series of rallies, demonstrations and blockades is presenting an unusually tricky challenge.
The outpouring of outrage started with November's disaster at Novi Sad railway station - when a concrete canopy collapsed at the recently-renovated facility, killing 15 people.
The station was part of the government's flagship infrastructure project - the high-speed railway linking the capital, Belgrade, to Budapest in Hungary. The fatal failure at such a high-profile site caused anguish and anger - and stoked suspicions that official corruption was behind the collapse.
Students have been leading the calls for transparency and accountability, holding daily 15-minute vigils for the dead. But workers, ranging from lawyers to farmers, have also been staging strikes and blocking roads.
"Everyone has a reason to be unhappy," says analyst and journalist Bojan Elek. "Terrible salaries, poor working conditions - everyone had something to add to the huge dissatisfaction that's in the population.
"But the students have been the key cohesive factor."
What the students have not been is political. They have kept opposition parties and NGOs away from their increasingly elaborate events, which have seen them take over the city centres of Novi Sad and Nis in recent weeks.
Mr Elek describes this as "a good move" - but notes that "at some point, politics will have to come into play".
What that might look like is not yet clear. Opposition parties are atomised - with no one single party capable of challenging the SNS, and an absence of a credible coalition.
They have at least been united in their calls for the establishment of a technical government following the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic at the end of January.
This could, they suggest, establish an electoral environment that would reduce the SNS's domination of the media and state bodies.
Vucic has rejected that idea as an opposition attempt to overthrow a legitimately elected government. He may appoint a replacement prime minister or call fresh elections, even though the previous polls were held as recently as December 2023.
Meanwhile, the protests continue. Students are promising their largest event yet in Belgrade on 15 March.

Headline: Briton captured while fighting for Ukraine jailed in Russia

Text: A British man who was captured while fighting for Ukraine's armed forces has been jailed for 19 years by a Russian military court.
James Scott Rhys Anderson was reportedly captured in Russia's Kursk region last November, where Ukraine had launched a cross-border incursion, and was charged with terrorism and mercenary activity.
The 22-year-old is the first British national to be convicted by Russia during the war.
The UK Foreign Office said Mr Anderson was sentenced on "false charges" and described him as a prisoner of war.
A statement released by the Russian court claimed Mr Anderson had pleaded guilty but this cannot be verified, as he has not been heard from independently since he was taken.
On Wednesday, a Russian military court ruled that Mr Anderson would spend the first five years of his sentence in prison before being transferred to a penal colony with "strict" conditions.
Russian investigators had accused him of "committing a terrorist act" as part of an organised group, illegally crossing the border into Russia, causing "significant damage to property" and having "destabilised" the activities of authorities.
But those claims were rejected by a UK Foreign Office spokesperson, who said they "strongly condemn" Mr Anderson's sentencing on "false charges".
"Under international law, prisoners of war cannot be prosecuted for participating in hostilities.
"We demand that Russia respect these obligations, including those under the Geneva Conventions, and stop using prisoners of war for political and propaganda purposes.
"We remain in close contact with Mr Anderson's family and are providing consular support."
Mr Anderson's three-day trial was held behind closed doors. Video footage released by the Kursk court showed Mr Anderson being led into court in handcuffs wearing a winter hat and jacket that appeared to be prison uniform.
Reports of Mr Anderson's capture first came to light after a video circulated online showing a man identifying himself while being captured. In another video, he identified himself as a former British Army soldier from Oxfordshire.
While Mr Anderson is the first UK citizen accused of fighting for Ukraine to be captured and convicted by Russia, two British captives were sentenced to death in Russia-occupied Donetsk - however, they were later released in a prisoner exchange.

Headline: Zelensky's conciliatory letter to Trump suggests he's out of options
Author: James Waterhouse, BBC Ukraine correspondent
Published Date: 2025-03-05T17:19:06.905Z
Text: Whether Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky's decision to patch up relations with his US counterpart Donald Trump is wise depends on who you ask in Ukraine.
"A very bad decision," remarked blogger and army serviceman Yuriy Kasyanov, who thinks the US "won't help Ukraine with anything" after this mineral deal is signed.
"The president behaved with dignity" said former MP Boryslav Bereza, who described Zelensky's softening of tone as an "apology".
Last night, Ukraine's leader gave his evening address from the courtyard outside Kyiv's Presidential Office. It was the same spot where he gave the now famous "we are all here" speech with his cabinet on the second day of Russia's invasion.
Back then, he'd turned down offers to leave. Many in the West expected Russia to be in the capital within days, with the president being captured or killed.
Three years on, it seems his choice to keep fighting has gradually been taken away from him.
He said he was ready to work under Trump's "strong leadership" and that it was "time to make things right".
Washington's hostile rhetoric, that Oval Office meeting and the "pausing" of US military aid have forced him to bend to Trump's peace vision.
Up until last week, Zelensky had held firm that Ukraine would only agree to peace if its security was guaranteed, otherwise it would fight on.
He also accused Trump of living in a "disinformation space" after the US president repeated some of Moscow's claims.
All of this served as a prelude to Friday's fiery exchange with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, who accused Zelensky of having "disrespected" the US and ultimately told him to leave.
The Ukrainian leader had a warmer reception from European leaders at the weekend - but while they pledged to help secure Ukraine in the future, they made clear peace would still require US involvement.
Then, on Tuesday, Trump paused US military aid to Ukraine, raising concerns it may only be able to hold out for a matter of months - and leaving Zelensky to make his peace with the situation.
In a letter to the US president, he even gave specifics on what the first stage of a peace process could involve, including a naval and aerial ceasefire - proposals first suggested by France's President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend.
Trump said he appreciated the letter, in a sign of cooling tensions between the two leaders, and that Zelensky had agreed to strike a peace deal.
What is more telling is Zelensky's willingness now to sign a mineral deal without the security guarantees he is hoping for - and had portrayed as essential until very recently.
The US has suggested the presence of US companies mining for natural resources would be enough to put Russia off breaking a ceasefire. However, American businesses didn't exactly put Moscow off from launching its full-scale invasion.
What's even more telling are the lack of compromises Russia would seemingly have to make in any peace agreement.
Perhaps Zelensky has run out of political road, and with his European allies acknowledging that they still need the US, Washington seems still to be the only place for him to turn to.

Headline: Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says
Author: Jacqueline Howard, BBC News, Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Reporting fromRome

Text: Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said.
The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on "non-invasive mechanical ventilation" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask.
He is free from fever, "always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before.
Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week.
The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago.
The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter.
In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals.
He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously.
After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing.
It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an "isolated" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said.
In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy.
During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added.
He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays.
The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days.
He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.
The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal.
Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger.

Headline: Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite

Text: Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning.
Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation.
"Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump," said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags.
"He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."
On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist.
Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue.
While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing.
In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency.
Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him.
The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May.
For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic.
For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change.
At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by.
"We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president," said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping.
One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December.
Some polls put him as high as 40%.
Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca.
Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders:
"He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."
Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters
In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact.
"But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right?
"Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."
As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. "Dacian Spring", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections.
Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react?
US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month.
"If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."
"Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear", added Vance.
Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced.

Text: "It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."
The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely.
The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well.
Europe is scrambling to react effectively.
There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday.
It is a huge moment in European history.
Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War.
Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears "not to care about the fate of Europe", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany.
But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving?
Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for "action not words". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a "steel porcupine", with urgent, extra arms deliveries.
Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities.
Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold:
First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the "heavy lifting" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer "freeloading" off the United States.
But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms.
It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove.
Russia is watching too.
The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable.
Moscow has already gloated about the "splits" it sees in Western unity.
Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator.
Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US.
That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump.
The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War.
The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support.
If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a "coalition of the willing" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences.
That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that "coalition". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe.
But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as "enablers".
Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia.
But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces.
Any European peacekeeping or "reassurance" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary.
These enablers "can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry", as one European politician put it to me.
This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible.
"Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger," one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me.
We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday.
"Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation.
"Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."
Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence.
On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it.
Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future.
Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little.
As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that "Europe is in an era of re-armament".
She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by:
EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine.
But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics.
Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way.
Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future.
Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence.
In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities.
But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow.
European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says.
If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

Headline: Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence

Text: Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure.
"In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes'," he said.
Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week.
He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of "recent decisions by the American government".
Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.
Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show "we are in a position to act independently in Europe".
At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by "mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded".
Merz said, in English, he would do "whatever it takes" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president.
At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence.
In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a "debt brake" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times.
The new defence proposal recommends that "necessary defence spending" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit.
Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded.
Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated.
Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%.
Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions.
The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party.
However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament.
Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a "big, important step" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday.
Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as "the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less".
Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: "Our country is wearing itself out."
Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Text: AIB, one of Ireland's two main banks, made a record pre-tax profit of €2.7bn (£2.2bn) in 2024, up 13% on the previous year.
The Irish state continues to own a 12% stake in the bank as a legacy of a bail-out during the financial crisis.
The bank's chief executive, Colin Hunt, said there was now "a clear path" to a return to full private ownership this year.
Last week AIB's main rival, Bank of Ireland, reported an annual pre-tax profit of €1.9bn (£1.6bn).
The two banks have benefitted from higher interest rates, a strong domestic economy and a relative lack of competition.
AIB said new mortgage lending in Ireland was up 14% to €4.5bn (£3.8bn) and reflected a mortgage market share of 36%.
The bank has a small operation in the UK, including seven branches in Northern Ireland.
Profit at AIB UK was down 40% from £197m to £116m, largely as a result of an increase in the amount of money set aside to cover the impact of bad loans.
These impairment charges increased from £33m to £76m.

Text: Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to work under Donald Trump's "strong leadership" to achieve a lasting peace days after their explosive Oval Office meeting.
The Ukrainian president described the White House showdown as "regrettable" in a lengthy social media post in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv.
Zelensky said "it was time to make things right", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table.
The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended.
"We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky – ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure – and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same," he wrote.
"Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal."
In his social media post, Zelensky said Friday's meeting "did not go the way it was supposed to be", adding: "It is regrettable that it happened this way," he wrote. "It is time to make things right. We would like future co-operation and communication to be constructive."
He also reiterated that Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US, after the failure to do so at the Washington meeting.
Ukraine woke to the news on Tuesday that the US was "pausing and reviewing" its military aid to the country after a breakdown in diplomacy last week.
In his post, Zelensky offered an overt declaration of gratitude for the help the US has so far given to his country.
"We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence," he wrote.
"And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this," he added, referring to the US anti-tank missile system sold to Ukraine during Trump's first administration.
During Friday's meeting in the Oval Office, Vice-President JD Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the military support the US had provided.
"Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?" Vance said, before Trump told Zelensky he was not being "very thankful".
Zelensky defended himself in the meeting, and began an interview with Fox News in the hours afterwards, saying: "I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support."
The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine.
After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of "gambling with World War III", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal – Trump told Zelensky "come back when you're ready for peace".
Trump is due to deliver an address to Congress later on Tuesday, during which the Reuters news agency reports he plans to announce a minerals deal between US and Ukraine has been signed.
A number of Ukraine's allies have commented on the latest from the Ukrainian president, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who welcomed Zelensky's "steadfast commitment to securing peace".
It is "vital that all parties worked towards a lasting and secure peace for Ukraine as soon as possible", a statement from No 10 said.
Likewise, French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky's willingness to "re-engage in dialogue" with Trump, the Elysee Palace said.
Days before his meeting with Zelensky, the US President had met with Macron, who travelled to Washington with a warning to Trump: "You can't be weak in the face of Putin."
While European leaders rallied behind Zelensky following the clash, Nato's secretary general advised the Ukrainian leader to "find a way" to restore his relationship with Trump.
Speaking to the BBC the following day, Mark Rutte said he had told him "we have to respect" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.
Zelensky's statement falls short of an apology to Trump, which those in the US president's camp had called for.
In Moscow, Vladimir Putin's team earlier welcomed the US's pause to military aid as likely to be the "best" contribution to peace.
"If the US stops, or pauses these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.
Trump himself has not commented on the pause to aid, nor Zelensky's response, however he did earlier berate the Ukrainian leader following his meetings with European allies at the weekend.
A Sunday summit - hosted by the UK prime minister - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine.
After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was "still very, very far away".
Trump described this as the "worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky", in a post on his Truth Social platform.
"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing," the president wrote.

Text: Gardaí (Irish police) are investigating after a boy was stabbed by another child at a primary school in north Dublin.
The incident, which happened on Tuesday, involved a knife, BBC News NI understands.
Both children involved attend the school, gardaí said.
The child is understood to be 11 years old, Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported.
He was taken to a Dublin hospital's intensive-care unit for treatment and has been described as having serious, non-life threatening injuries.
Gardaí said they are liaising with school management and staff with a view to identifying the circumstances around the incident.
It is not being treated as a criminal investigation due to the ages of the children involved.
In the Republic of Ireland, the minimum age of responsibility in most cases is 12.
The Irish education department confirmed its psychological service is providing support to staff and the school community.

Headline: Ireland moves to change rules on deploying military

Text: Ireland is in a "serious period of reform" when it comes to defence and security, the tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) has said.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Irish Cabinet approved draft legislation to change the rules that govern how its military can be used abroad.
The reforms include changes to what it known as 'the triple lock', requiring the approval of the United Nations (UN), government and Dáil (lower house of Irish parliament) for certain troop deployments.
Under existing rules, 12 members of the Irish Defence Forces can be sent on an overseas mission without triggering the lock.
The proposed change would mean removing the need for UN approval and raising to 50 the number of troops that can be deployed without sign off from the Dáil.
Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ's Six One news programme, Simon Harris said the removal of the triple lock system is about "sovereignty".
"We have a very proud track record in the country of peacekeeping," he added.
"But the idea that any permanent member of the security council can have a veto, including Vladimir Putin, on where our defence forces go is not democratic."
The foreign affairs minister said it was "important" for decisions on peacekeeping to be taken in Ireland.
Asked if the removal of the triple lock threatened Ireland's policy of military neutrality, Harris said that was something "extraordinarily important" to the Irish people.
"We do also need to spend more on defence because actually when you are militarily neutral, you still have an obligation to your own people, to your own country, you still have an obligation to protect your own seas and your own skies," he said.
"We are in an era now of significant investment in defence... but all of that very much aligned with military neutrality."
Earlier, Taoiseach (prime minister) Micheál Martin said that Russia and China should not have a veto on where Irish troops are sent.
"This is about exercising our own sovereignty," he added.
Sinn Féin have described the move as an "abandonment" of Ireland's policy of neutrality.
Sinn Féin TD (MP) Pearse Doherty said "the Irish people are against it", and called for a referendum on the issue.
The move comes as the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced plans to give member states more fiscal space for defence investments, as well as €150 billion (£124bn) in loans for those investments.
Earlier on Tuesday, the US announced it would pause military aid to Ukraine.
"We are in an era of rearmament, and Europe is massively ready to boost its defence spending, both to respond to the short-term urgency to act and to support Ukraine, but also to address the long-term need to take on more responsibility for our own European security," von der Leyen said.
Earlier, Brig Gen Rossa Mulcahy was appointed as the next Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces.
Announcing the appointment, the Defence Forces said that Brig Gen Mulcahy has more than 35 years of experience across a variety of roles, both at home and overseas.
He has served in deployments to Lebanon, Syria and Afghanistan with the United Nations and NATO.
Since 2021, he has held the role of assistant chief of staff and he is due to take up the new appointment on 1 June.
The announcement follows the Irish government's nomination of the outgoing chief, Seán Clancy, as chair of the EU Military Committee.
In his current role, Brig Gen Mulcahy has responsibility for a range of organisational issues including; organisation transformation, capability development, innovation, risk management, corporate governance, and industrial relations.
He holds bachelor's degrees from the National University of Ireland Galway and University College Dublin, and a master's degree in Leadership Management and Defence Studies.
He is a graduate of the Defence Forces's Senior Command and Staff Course and the US Army Command and General Staff College.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Brig Gen Mulcahy will be appointed for a minimum of two years, during which time major changes to the Defence Forces's command structures are set to be introduced.
This includes a new position of chief of defence, which Brig Gen Mulcahy will be eligible to apply for.
Under new plans, the chief of defence will have military control with clearer statutory roles and responsibilities, and more clarity in the defined roles of the Department of Defence and Defence Forces.

Headline: Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case

Text: A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind.
The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022.
She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024.
Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case.
The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos).
"I want to finish with dignity once and for all," Noelia told the court on Tuesday.
She claimed to have been "coerced" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with "small pictures, crosses and religious symbols".
The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that "no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."
However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to "the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."
He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment.
His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times.
The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision.
Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist.
A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide.
Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Text: Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia.
"Women, men and children" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said.
NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship.
However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said.
It added that no European country had intervened "despite the imminent emergency" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones.
NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March.
The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said.
In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were "suffering from hunger and dying of cold".
Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized.
"Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive]," he said.
Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars.
Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea.

Headline: The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky

Text: Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind.
After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin.
Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting "he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change".
What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support?
This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US.
Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: "You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."
Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House.
That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was "crucial for both our countries".
But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more.
Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation.
But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump.
He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is "very, very far away".
Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv.
The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians.
Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider.
Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war.
Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed "a bit undemocratic" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president.
He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion.
It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him "because of his illegitimacy".
But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that.
Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery.
Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems.
Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%.
So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead?
European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability.
She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine.
But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words "it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting".
Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as "existentially important" for Ukraine and the entire continent.

Headline: Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia

Text: Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion three years ago. Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control over the past year, mostly in the east of Ukraine, but Ukrainian forces have made those advances as slow and difficult as possible and have staged a counter-offensive into Russian territory.
Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine.
In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Donbas, enveloping and overwhelming villages and towns.
Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time. Ukrainian military intelligence says about 620,000 Russian soldiers are operating in Ukraine and Kursk, according to experts at the Institute for the Study of War.
They also expect Russian forces to focus on seizing frontline Ukrainian towns and cities over the winter. The Russian recently took the town of Kurakhove and have continued advancing to the north east, towards the city of Pokrovsk, where they have been met by Ukrainian forces.
The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months, but innovative tactics by Ukrainian forces, combining the use of drones and ground forces, have inflicted significant losses of troops and equipment and slowed the offensive.
It has taken a year for Russia's troops to advance about 40km (25 miles) west - Ukraine was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, in February 2024 after months of fighting.
Almost all of Avdiivka's pre-war population of more than 30,000 people have left and the town itself is almost completely destroyed.
In addition to its operation on the eastern front, Russia began what the ISW describes as its "subordinate main effort" when it crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv, in May 2024. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.
The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress which was resolved last April.
Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery.
Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russia had already seized the southern peninsula of Crimea in February 2014 before annexing it soon afterwards.
Trump has said it is unlikely Ukraine will return to its pre-2014 borders but, in response to a question from the BBC, he said "some of that land will come back".
In an interview with the Guardian, published on 11 February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region in recent months as part of a peace deal.
Ukraine seized control of part of the region in a surprise attack launched across the border by Ukrainian troops in August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region.
Almost 200,000 people were evacuated from areas along the border by the Russian government, and Putin condemned the Ukrainian offensive as a "major provocation".
After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages.
Some of that territory has been regained by Russia but Ukraine still has troops in the Kursk region.
Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov described Zelensky's suggestion of a territory swap as "impossible".
Russia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.
Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.
Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.
By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.
Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months, with at least 70,000 Russian troops killed - and an estimated 500,000 being either killed or injured in total, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.

To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.
The situation in Ukraine is often fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.

Text: Two people - an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man - have been killed after a vehicle drove into a pedestrian area in the city of Mannheim, western Germany.
Five people were seriously injured and another five suffered minor injuries in the incident, investigators said.
Authorities arrested a lone suspect, a 40-year-old German man, who is not believed to be linked to extremism but shows "concrete indications of mental illness".
The suspect, who prosecutors said was a landscape gardener, remains in hospital in a stable condition after shooting himself with a gun loaded with blanks.
The incident occurred at around 12:15 local time (11:15 GMT), Mannheim police said.
CCTV footage showed a black hatchback car speeding along Planken shopping street in Mannheim, heading west.
Images from the scene showed police inspecting the car, a small black Ford, which had sustained heavy damage to its front.
The images show the car missing a hub cap on its front left wheel. In the CCTV footage, the front left hub cap also appears to be missing.
Thomas Strobl, interior minister of Baden-Württemberg, said the man used the vehicle "as a weapon".
"This act is one of several crimes in the recent past in which a car was misused as a weapon," Mr Strobl said, but added that there is no evidence to suggest the incident is connected to the Easter carnival taking place in the city.
Police are investigating two counts of murder and several of attempted murder, Mannheim chief public prosecutor Romeo Schluessler told reporters.
Mannheim's mayor described the incident as "abhorrent and "inhumane".
"Our thoughts are with the dead and injured, their families and friends," Mayor Christian Specht said.
Olaf Scholz, Germany's outgoing chancellor, thanked the emergency services and wished "strength" for eyewitnesses in Mannheim to "process what they have experienced".
"We mourn with the relatives of the victims of a senseless act of violence and fear for those injured," he said in a social media post.
The incident comes at a time of heightened security as outdoor carnivals linked to Easter celebrations are held across Germany.
There was a parade through the Mannheim city centre on Sunday, with major events scheduled for Tuesday.
A market has now been closed and a street carnival in the city centre will not take place. Carnival events in the nearby suburbs of Feudenheim, Neckarau and Sandhofen have also been cancelled.
Germany has endured a number of violent attacks over the last year, which have left several people dead and hundreds injured.
Nine months ago, also in Mannheim and only a few blocks away from where Monday's attack is believed to have taken place, an Afghan man stabbed several people, killing a policeman.
Then, in August, another knife attack left eight people injured and three dead in Solingen. The Syrian man who was charged with the crime was suspected of links with the Islamic State terrorist group.
In December a man rammed a car into a crowd at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, leaving six dead and 299 injured. A 50-year-old Saudi psychiatrist was arrested.
In January, a 28-year-old Afghan asylum seeker attacked a group of small children in a park in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg, killing a two-year-old child and a passer-by who tried to help the boy.
And in February, a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker drove a car into a crowd, injuring more than two dozen people. A mother and child later died from their injuries.

Headline: Pope Francis 'alert' after respiratory failure

Text: Pope Francis is alert after suffering two episodes of "acute respiratory failure" on Monday afternoon, the Vatican has said.
Doctors were forced to intervene to clear mucus from the Pope's lungs, an update from the Holy See said, though it said he was alert throughout.
The 88-year-old pontiff has resumed the use of an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing, but remains "alert, focused and cooperative", the Vatican said.
This is now the third serious downturn since the 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to hospital 18 days ago with pneumonia.
On Friday, Pope Francis suffered an "isolated" breathing crisis involving vomiting, the Vatican said.
Updates from the Holy See reported that he responded well to oxygen therapy, with Vatican officials saying on Sunday the Pope no longer required "non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy".
Following Monday's episodes, Pope Francis has resumed that mechanical ventilation.
His illness has meant that Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person for three weeks in a row, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead.
Officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written "in the past few days". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care.
He will also miss the procession and mass this Wednesday that mark the first day of Lent, the six-week period leading to Easter.
Hundreds of Catholics gathered outside in St Peter's Square on Monday for an eighth evening to pray for the Pope's health, many carrying rosary beads as they headed across the cobbles towards the Basilica.
The crowd, a mixture of priests and nuns based in Rome and Catholic pilgrims here for a Jubilee year, were led by an American cardinal.
"I come every night to pray, but this night I am pretty worried," Javier, a Romanian priest, voiced the feelings of many on the square. "We still have hope, but it doesn't look good."
"It looks bad, and that's a shame because we really like Francis," Patricia, a Spanish catholic from Toledo, told the BBC.
She was following the prayers with her husband and young daughter.
"He's really opened the doors of the church to many, like LGBT people. I think they will look for a more conservative pope next, to stop the change."
Catholics have also been visiting the Gemelli hospital in Rome to pray for him - hoping he might come to the window, as has happened in the past.
But although the Vatican recently described the Pope's condition as stable, he remains too sick even to greet the crowd below.
The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days.
He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.
The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal.
Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger.

Headline: Trump condemns Zelensky remarks that war's end is 'far away'

Text: A statement by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying a deal to end the war with Russia was "very far away" has drawn a furious response by Donald Trump.
"America will not put up with it for much longer," the US president said in a social media post, before accusing Zelensky of not wanting peace.
A summit of mostly European leaders in London on Sunday agreed a four-point plan to guarantee Ukraine's defence in the event of a peace deal with Russia.
"Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?" Trump said, apparently referring to the summit held two days after his fiery clash with Zelensky at the Oval Office.
The summit - hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine and an attempt to reduce differences between Western countries over Ukraine.
Britain and France said they were working on a European-led solution to the conflict.
After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was "still very, very far away".
He added that he expected the US to continue backing Ukraine despite his own fraught relations with Trump.
"I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America," Zelensky said late on Sunday.
But on Monday, Trump responded by reiterating his view that Zelensky stood in the way of peace negotiations.
"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer! It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing," he wrote on his Truth Social media network.
During a news briefing later on Monday, Trump once again said that Zelensky "should be more appreciative" for the aid he has received from the US in the three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
During the confrontation in front of cameras at the White House, both Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance expressed anger at what they perceived as Zelensky's lack of gratitude.
"Just say thank you," Vance demanded at one point.
The angry exchange meant that a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals was left unsigned.
In his news conference on Monday, Trump said he did not believe the agreement was dead.
He added that he would provide an update on the minerals deal late on Tuesday.
After the London summit, the UK and France suggested a European "coalition of the willing" to defend Ukraine - and to make sure Russia would not invade after a peace deal.
Sir Keir said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally.
Scandinavian countries have signalled they were open to the idea if it had the backing of the US.
The European moves follow a reversal of US policy under President Trump.
He says he wants to end the war and has held a lengthy telephone conversation with Putin and a round of talks with Moscow to which Ukraine was excluded.
Trump has caused consternation among Western allies by saying he trusts Putin, accusing Zelensky of being a dictator and even saying Ukraine started the war, not Russia.

Headline: Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?

Text: Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides?
President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London.
In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east.
"In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected," Macron told the newspaper.
In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: "Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."
This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting.
An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump.
It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace.
Under the French proposal, a European "assurance force" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed.
Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: "Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."
But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: "A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage".
The prime minister's spokesman said: "There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."
Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was "premature", according to the Italian news agency Ansa.
"I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace," Tajani said. "Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."
There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm?
But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely "blue-skies thinking" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits.
They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans.
Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach.
Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: "I'm aware of everything."
So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: "Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles."

Text: Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous.
The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine.
At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the "coalition of the willing", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached.
But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome?
First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support?
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine.
Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions.
In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended.
Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions.
There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them.
The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle.
A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: "Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."
It goes on to say that: "The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."
In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup.
Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them.
The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces.
Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one.
Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word "hope" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop.
So far, that looks unlikely.
Why on earth would it? - some would argue.
Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US.
Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia.
President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return.
The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet.
At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Text: Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea.
Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT).
"Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump," police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working.
Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month.
There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement.
However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages.
Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: "We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."
There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added.
Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island.
Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump.
Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

Headline: Blatter and Platini back in court in Swiss Fifa fraud case

Text: Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and French football legend Michel Platini are back in court in Switzerland to face accusations of fraud.
In 2022, the pair were acquitted in a trial over a payment of 2m Swiss francs (£1.6m) made to Platini and authorised by Blatter in 2011.
Both men denied wrongdoing and said the transfer was belated payment for Fifa advisory work by Platini, who formerly led European football's governing body Uefa.
But the Swiss federal prosecutor appealed against the decision. The new trial is expected to last until Thursday, with a verdict due on 25 March.
The pair appeared before an appeals court in Muttenz, near Basel, on Monday. Blatter, 88, reaffirmed that he was innocent.
"When you talk about falsehoods, lies and deception, that's not me. That didn't exist in my whole life," he told the court.
A lawyer for Platini, 69, said the lower court that acquitted the pair in 2022 had been "right to find that the disputed payment of 2m francs was lawful".
Platini had an illustrious playing career and is a three-time winner of the Ballon d'Or - Europe's highest individual football award.
He captained France to victory at the 1984 European Championship and won the 1985 European Cup with Juventus. He went on to coach the French national team and became Uefa president in 2007.
In 2015, prosecutors accused the pair of deceiving Fifa about payments made to Platini.
In his testimony at the first trial, Blatter said that he had asked Platini to work as his adviser in 1998. He added that at the time, Fifa could not afford the 1m Swiss francs annual fee requested by Platini.
They instead settled on partial payment, with the outstanding balance to be paid at a later date. Platini said during the trial: "I trusted the president, and knew he would pay me one day."
He stopped working for Fifa in 2002 but initially did not pursue the payment as he told the court he had not needed the money at the time, and - according to Blatter - Fifa was "broke". In January 2011, however, Platini felt he was in a position to send an invoice and the money was paid after approval by Blatter.
Following an investigation launched in 2015, Swiss prosecutors accused Blatter and Platini of forgery and fraud.
Also in 2015, Fifa suspended both men from football for ethics breaches - originally for eight years, although their exclusions were later reduced.
In 2022, Switzerland's federal criminal court in Bellinzona cleared the two after accepting their account of a "gentlemen's agreement" for the payment.
Swiss businessman and sports administrator Blatter joined Fifa in 1975, became general secretary in 1981 and then president of world football's governing body in 1998.
He remained in the role for 17 years until resigning amid corruption investigations. Platini later withdrew his own candidacy for president.

Headline: Starmer announces 'coalition of the willing' to guarantee Ukraine peace

Text: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.
The UK, France and other countries will step up their efforts in a "coalition of the willing" and seek to involve the US in their support for Ukraine, he said on Sunday - after calling a summit of 18 leaders, mostly from Europe and including Volodymyr Zelensky - three days earlier.
"We are at a crossroads in history today," Starmer said after the summit while Zelensky said Kyiv felt "strong support" and the gathering showed "European unity at an extremely high level not seen for a long time".
It comes two days after a fiery exchange between the Ukrainian leader and US President Donald Trump in the White House.
"We are all working together in Europe in order to find a basis for cooperation with America for a true peace and guaranteed security," Zelensky said after the summit.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron told Le Figaro newspaper that Paris and London wanted to propose a one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure".
Speaking at a news conference shortly after the meeting of leaders, Starmer said four points had been agreed:
Starmer also announced an additional £1.6bn ($2bn) of UK export finance to buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles. This comes on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more military aid to Ukraine backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.
"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength," he said.
The prime minister did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition of the willing, but said that those who had committed would intensify planning with real urgency.
The UK, he said, would back its commitment with "boots on the ground, and planes in the air".
"Europe must do the heavy lifting," he said, before adding that the agreement would need US backing and had to include Russia, but that Moscow could not be allowed to dictate terms.
"Let me be clear, we agree with Trump on the urgent need for a durable peace. Now we need to deliver together," Starmer said.
When asked if the US under Trump was an unreliable ally, he said: "Nobody wanted to see what happened last Friday, but I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally."
Countries at the summit included France, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, Norway, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Finland, Italy, Spain and Canada.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that there was now an urgent need to "re-arm Europe".
These sentiments were echoed by Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who said the meeting had seen European countries "stepping up" to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to "stay in the fight as long as it has to continue".
After the summit, Zelensky went to Sandringham where he met King Charles III. He later spoke to reporters at a final press briefing where he said he was ready to sign a deal on minerals with the US.
Ukraine was expected to sign the deal - which would grant the US access to Ukraine's rare mineral reserves - during Zelensky's visit to Washington, but the Ukrainian delegation ultimately left early after a heated confrontation with Trump in the Oval Office.
Earlier on Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned a deal on minerals between the US and Ukraine could not be signed "without a peace deal" with Russia.
But when asked by the BBC about the future of the deal following the summit, Zelensky said it was ready to be signed.
"The agreement that's on the table will be signed if the parties are ready," he said.
Sunday's summit concludes a hectic week of diplomacy, which included visits to Washington by Macron, Starmer and Zelensky.
Zelensky's meeting, however, culminated in a heated exchanged with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, in which the US president accused his Ukrainian counterpart of "gambling with World War Three".
Trump has said he wants to end the war in Ukraine and has expressed trust in Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the consternation of many of his Western allies.
The US has also begun peace talks with Russia - excluding Ukraine.
At one point, the US leader accused Ukraine of starting the war - even though it was Putin who launched a full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbour on 24 February 2022.

Headline: Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind

Text: "Bruised but motivated," was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport.
The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president "all bells and whistles" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me.
He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea.
But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood.
Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted.
"If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down," he said.
He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees.
Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources.
Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm.
He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be "talking about lines", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier.
He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for.
Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader.
Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice.
He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never "insult anybody" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone.
Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass.
If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry.
If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war.
Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs.
But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war.
Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade.
"Our freedoms and values are not for sale," a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal.
He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors.
Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone.
Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked.
"I am aware of everything," he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane.
He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

Headline: Ukraine still 'ready' to sign US minerals deal, Zelensky tells BBC

Text: Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is still "ready to sign" a US-Ukraine minerals deal after leaving the White House without it being agreed.
Ukraine's president said in response to a question from the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that, despite a fractious meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, he is still willing to have a "constructive dialogue" with the US, adding: "I just want the Ukrainian position to be heard."
"We want our partners to remember who the aggressor is in this war," he told reporters.
When relations between the US and Ukraine first became strained over the Trump administration's handing of peace talks with Russia, the minerals deal was intended as a stepping stone towards further security ties between the two countries.
But after Zelensky, Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance had a heated argument in front of the media in the Oval Office, the Ukrainian leader was told to leave without the deal being signed.
Zelensky's remarks come as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the BBC's US partner CBS News it was "impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal".
Bessent said Zelensky had "thrown off the sequencing" of how the minerals deal and peace deal were supposed to play out - instead choosing to "relitigate" discussions in public when they should have taken place in private.
Speaking after a summit of European leaders in London on Sunday, Zelensky said the combative nature of his recent meeting in Washington did not benefit the US or Ukraine as partners, and only really benefited Russian President Vladimir Putin.
However, he said that he would return to the White House if invited.
But he refused to be drawn into talking about conceding territory to Putin - an option Trump officials have touted as part of a peace deal - or expressing regret in how he had handled the meeting with Trump.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory.
Zelensky was speaking to the media in London following a summit in which world leaders agreed on a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to stop the war and defend it from future Russian aggression.
Among these pledges is for the UK, France and other nations to form a "coalition of the willing" to defend a potential peace agreement in Ukraine.
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reiterated Europe "must do the heavy lifting", but any agreement would need US backing.
Asked for his thoughts on the outcome of the summit, Zelensky said the "best security guarantees are a strong Ukrainian army".
But he added Europe needed some form of US input, perhaps in the form of air defence and intelligence, in an apparent sign of agreement with Sir Keir.
In an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper on the way to the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron was quoted as saying that a month-long truce on striking in the air, on the sea and energy infrastructure was on the table.
During this time, a peace deal could be thrashed out, while the deployment of European troops would occur in a second stage.
Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about these reports, Zelensky replied he was "aware of everything".
Zelensky insisted Ukraine's relationship with the US will continue and he was "sure this situation will pass by", in reference to the fall-out with Trump.
He said there had been communication between the US and Ukraine since Friday, but "not on my level".
The Ukrainian leader also said: "The failure of Ukraine would not just mean Putin's success, it would be a failure for Europe, it would be a failure for the US."
Following the row in the Oval Office, several leading Republicans backed how the meeting had been handled by Trump and criticised Zelensky.
Senator Lindsey Graham - once a staunch supporter of Ukraine - told reporters that Zelensky "either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change".
Asked about these calls to step down in the interest of US-Ukraine relations, Zelensky said that to resign was one thing, but preventing him from running again would require Nato membership.
Ukraine joining the transatlantic military alliance has been a demand of Kyiv since the war began, and forms a key part of the country's victory plan - though the Trump administration has said this was unlikely.
"I am exchangeable for Nato," Zelensky told journalists before he was due to leave the UK.
"I have said that I am exchanging for Nato membership, then it means I have fulfilled my mission. Nato means I have fulfilled my mission."
He added it was "not very democratic" for people from other nations to be deciding who led Ukraine, but said Graham could become Ukrainian and then "his voice will have weight" in deciding who its leader was.

Text: Volodymyr Zelensky has met King Charles III at Sandringham, after attending a summit of European leaders on ending the war in Ukraine.
As the Ukrainian president arrived at the King's Norfolk residence, local residents, some holding Ukraine flags, gathered outside the estate to witness his entrance by helicopter.
Zelensky was in London over the weekend for the talks on European defence, after a fiery exchange with US President Donald Trump in the White House on Friday.
Ukraine's president was "warmly received", and the meeting lasted just under an hour, royal sources said. The pair were served tea in Sandringham's Saloon room.
Zelensky described it as "a very good meeting".
"I'm very grateful for this meeting and for how His Majesty helps Ukraine and supports us," he told reporters. "He's met our warriors here, being trained in the UK, and we're very thankful to the Royal Family for their support."
The King has previously expressed support for Zelensky and Ukraine, saying the country had experienced "indescribable aggression" following Russia's "unprovoked attack on their land".
The Ukrainian people have shown "truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy", the King said last year.
They first met at Buckingham Palace during Zelensky's surprise visit to the UK in 2023, and the same day the King visited Ukrainian troops being trained in Wiltshire.
Today's meeting was requested by the Ukrainian president, with the agreement of the UK government.
After the summit had concluded, Sir Keir unveiled a four-step plan world leaders hope will guarantee peace in Ukraine.
These steps include keeping military aid flowing and the creation of a "coalition of the willing" to defend Ukraine as part of a peace agreement.
Sunday's meeting in Norfolk has allowed Zelensky to meet the King well before Trump's second state visit to the UK, which was offered when Sir Keir presented the US president with an invitation letter from the monarch during a visit to Washington last week.
While the Ukrainian leader's visit is an official one, it is less formal than a state visit.
Traditionally, second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.
Sir Keir said Trump's last state visit in 2019 had been a "tremendous success" and that the invite for a second visit was "truly historic" and "unprecedented".
Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after reading the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an "honour" to visit the "fantastic" country. When the trip will take place has yet to be announced.
Sir Keir dismissed calls by SNP first minister John Swinney to cancel the invite to Trump after his disastrous Oval Office meeting with Zelensky - in which he accused the Ukrainian leader of "gambling with World War Three".

Text: Lancaster House may have been bathed in sunshine as European leaders gathered to chart a way forward for Ukraine.
But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London.
It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine?
The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US.
He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's "armed forces and border defences" to ensure that "Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself," according to the official conclusions of the summit.
And Sir Keir said there would be a "coalition of the willing" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace.
Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be "a force consisting of European and other partners".
The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.
The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a "steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders".
The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop.
The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace.
Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly "to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing".
This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Europeans also wanted to find ways of repairing the transatlantic alliance, which is looking pretty fragile after the confrontation between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday.
In recent weeks, the US administration has gone after its European allies; questioning their democracy, voting against them at the United Nations and - in the form of the president's chief enforcer, Elon Musk - saying even the US should leave the Nato military alliance.
The summit in London was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. Diplomats said there was clear resolve around the table to support Ukraine but also to build on Trump's desire to find a ceasefire.
But Europe stepping up is only half of the story and much depends on whether the US is willing to play its part.
Diplomats say the US is willing to de-escalate the tensions with Zelensky, but there were mixed messages on Sunday. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine, but the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire.
So the outcome of the Lancaster House summit was seemingly a united European front in backing Zelensky, with the promise of more military support for Ukraine to come.
But the cloud lurking in the London skies remains what the United States does next. And that is not yet clear. Trump and his deputy have made their antipathy towards Zelensky as clear as their trust in Putin.

Headline: Pope absent from St Peter's Square for third week

Text: For the third week in a row, Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead.
Vatican officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written "in the past few days". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care.
"I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord," he wrote.
"At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people."
The Pope usually makes his address from a window of the official Vatican appartments, drawing a crowd below on St Peter's Square.
Many Catholics come specially for the chance to see him but this is now the longest Pope Francis has been out of the public eye since he was elected.
Each evening on the square, a group of cardinals lead people in prayers for his health.
In his latest written address, the Pope told Catholics that he felt their "affection and closeness" and felt "carried and supported by all God's people".
The Vatican said he remained stable on Sunday, although doctors still describe his overall condition - with pneumonia - as "complex" and the risk of another infection is high. After 16 days in hospital, they are still giving no prognosis.
The medical team has not spoken directly to journalists for over a week, and all updates are coming via Vatican officials.
On Sunday, they said the Pope no longer required "non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy".
He does not have a fever and was able to participate in mass in a chapel on the 10th floor of Rome's Gemelli hospital where he is being treated.
The Pope also received two visitors - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Parolin and his deputy Monsignor Pena Parra. They are the first to be mentioned by the Vatican in almost a week.
There are no details about the length of time the men spent with him or what was discussed.
The latest details do suggest that the Pope has rallied somewhat since Friday, when he suffered a second breathing "crisis" which doctors had worried might have a lasting impact. It was the second time the word "crisis" had been used since he was admitted to hospital on 14 February.
By Sunday, though, Vatican sources were more reassuring.
"The Pope woke, had breakfast with coffee, continued his therapy and read the newspapers as he usually does," they told journalists.
In his Sunday Angelus, the Pope prayed for peace, including in "tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel", adding: "From here, war appears even more absurd."
Always outspoken against war, some of the Pope's previous comments on Ukraine have nevertheless created controversy.
He suggested that Russia's full-scale invasion was "somehow provoked" and on one occasion agreed that Kyiv should show "the courage of the white flag" and negotiate for peace.

Text: President Zelensky has joked he is "aware of everything" after being asked about reports of a proposed truce by Starmer and Macron.
After a European summit in London, Zelensky faced reporters' questions ahead of boarding a flight to leave the UK. Laura Kuenssberg asked him about reports Macron had shared news of the proposed deal with French newspaper Le Figaro.
The paper reports the French president as saying he and Sir Keir Starmer do not believe in a ceasefire signed by the US and Russia and have put an alternative month-long truce on the table.

Headline: His name was in a child abuse diary - now his family listen to 'vile' testimony

Text: This story contains distressing details from the start
When Mauricette Vinet speaks of her grandson, her voice grows warm with affection.
"He was a lovely little boy. He had a strong personality, for sure! But he always thought of others, always asked if he could help," says the French retiree, in her 80s.
"He loved to be out in the garden with his grandfather, picking green beans. He was a charming boy, Mathis," she adds.
"But, as you know, there was a 'before' - and there was an 'after'."
Mauricette and her husband Roland are among the 267 plaintiffs who have pressed charges against Joël Le Scouarnec, the French former surgeon who is accused of abusing almost 300 people - mostly children, and almost all his patients - over the course of several decades. The trial started in Vannes, Brittany, on Monday.
Le Scouarnec and Mathis only crossed paths once, when Mathis, aged 10, was hospitalised overnight at the clinic in the small French north-western town of Quimperlé. Le Scouarnec - a mild-mannered, respected gastrointestinal surgeon - told Mathis' parents the boy had to be kept overnight for checks.
It turned out Mathis only had a stomach ache, and he was sent home the next day. But Mauricette is convinced the brief hospital stay changed Mathis forever.
"The unease set in, little by little. It happened gradually in the first year; then he stopped being happy and became aggressive with everyone," she tells the BBC.
There is no way to establish conclusively whether Mathis' troubles were linked to the surgeon. What is certain is that in his teenage years Mathis distanced himself from his family and started using increasingly hard drugs; later, he spent time in detox and rehab centres.
Then, in 2018, police knocked on his door.
They told him a man named Joël Le Scouarnec had been arrested the year before for raping his six-year-old neighbour. During a search of the surgeon's home, police uncovered stacks of diaries and hard disks in which Le Scouarnec appeared to list hundreds more victims. Mathis' name was among them.
Mauricette said Mathis told her police then read out an excerpt of the diary to him, which seemed to detail abuse Le Scouarnec's inflicted on him during his hospital stay.
"Then they left. Mathis shut the door and was left on his own, with no help. And that was the beginning of a descent into hell," Mauricette says.
The police visit helped Mathis make sense of flashbacks that had long plagued him, Mauricette says: "His malaise finally made sense; he traced it to the source."
Mathis pressed charges against Le Scouarnec, but the revelations sent him down a spiral which came to an abrupt end on 14 April 2021, when Mathis overdosed and died. He was 24.
Mauricette and her husband pressed charges the very next day, and they are now listed as "indirect victims" of Le Scouarnec. They have attended court in Vannes, north-western France, every day since the trial opened on Monday.
It has not been an easy listen.
The testimony of witnesses - mostly close relatives of Le Scouarnec, now 74 – painted a picture of an apparently ordinary middle-class family which, behind the scenes, has been ravaged by child abuse, incest and sexual violence.
Annie, Le Scouarnec's sister, said she had been "taught to keep quiet".
This week, it was all brought out in the open.
All three sons of Le Scouarnec struck an almost apologetic tone as they told the court about their happy childhoods with a cultured, intellectual father who may not have been particularly present but who was kind, patient and supportive.
"We had holidays, nice houses - everything that constitutes a normal family," said one.
The youngest son – who said he stopped contact with Le Scouarnec in 2017 "to preserve the image of him I have from my childhood" – said he now "looked upon everyone with distrust" and never left his own toddler alone with anybody.
"I am always worried that if my father could do this then my neighbour could, my partner, anyone," the 37-year-old said.
Later the middle son – a tall man in his early 40s who admitted he was a "not totally abstinent alcoholic" – shared his memories of being abused at the hands of his paternal grandfather, Le Scouarnec's father.
He was shocked as he was told for the first time in court that among his father's alleged victims were some of his childhood friends.
And, on Friday, a stunned silence descended upon the courtroom as Le Scouarnec admitted he had abused his granddaughter - his eldest son's daughter when she was under five years old. Moments after the revelation, the 44-year-old and his partner left the room to be assisted by a psychologist.
Other witnesses sparked consternation in the plaintiffs. Due to their sheer number, they sit in a separate room – a former university lecture hall – and follow proceedings via video link.
Christian D., a friend of Le Scouarnec now aged 80, often answered questions from the court sarcastically and repeatedly minimised the events at the centre of the trial, declaring that he could not "afford to cry over everything that happened in the world".
Later, he insisted that he "never saw anything, therefore had nothing to say" about the devastating allegations against his friend. When he stated that he would take in Le Scouarnec if he was ever to leave jail, many alleged victims in the lecture hall got up and left their seats.
But most difficult for Mauricette and Roland was the much-awaited testimony of Marie-France L., Le Scouarnec's ex-wife.
It has been alleged that she was at the centre of the omerta that reigned in the Le Scouarnec family, as she was repeatedly made aware of her husband's obsession with children but did nothing to stop it.
Many lawyers and plaintiffs now believe she could have spared hundreds of children from being abused. Le Scouarnec's brother - who was also heard this week - openly wondered whether she had been too enamoured by the lifestyle provided by her husband's salary to speak out.
Marie-France has always denied this and, at the stand, was frequently defiant in the face of the accusations levelled at her.
"Catastrophe has struck: she knows I am a paedophile," Le Scouarnec wrote as early as the mid-1990s in his diary. "Perhaps he was talking about his conscience," Marie-France told the court.
She also suggested her five-year-old niece – who Le Scouarnec has been convicted of raping – had most likely "manipulated" her husband.
"She's devious, that one. She loves the attention," she said. Later, she complained that she was being "blamed" for everything. Only when she was shown an indecent photo montage Le Scouarnec made of their son as a child did she look visibly shocked.
"That was absolute theatre," Mauricette told the BBC, adding that Christian D.'s testimony had been "vile" and that she thought Marie-France was living in "pure denial".
As the gut-wrenching events played out, Le Scouarnec sat in his box – mostly reactionless, but at times noticeably agitated, his voice cracking as he asked his sons for forgiveness. He flinched when excerpts of his diary were read out, and averted his eyes as indecent photographs he took of his nieces were shown.
His lawyers have said he admits to the "majority" of the charges against him, and that he will explain himself over the course of the trial, which is due to last until June.
The alleged victims will take the stand from next week; Mauricette and Roland will do so in April. "I will look at Le Scouarnec and tell him what is deep in my heart - he killed my grandson," Mauricette says.
"Not with a gun, but he killed him," she adds. "He's going to get 20 years, but his victims... will have to live with this their whole lives.
"Their sentences will be longer than his."
Throughout the week, over in the victims' hall, people came and went, but the majority stayed for hours on end each day.
As descriptions of trauma and abuse poured in, one middle-aged woman covered her face with her hand and kept it there a long time.
Next to her, a young man rubbed his eyes repeatedly, then stood up and left.

Headline: Pope is 'stable' after breathing crisis, Vatican says

Text: Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for two weeks, is in a stable condition following an "isolated" breathing crisis on Friday, the Vatican has said.
The 88-year-old experienced an episode of vomiting and a "sudden worsening of his respiratory condition" in hospital last night, and received gas through a face mask to help him breathe.
The Vatican said on Saturday evening that the Pope had not suffered further breathing crises and had responded well to oxygen therapy.
It did not share a prognosis, but said the pontiff remained "alert and well oriented".
In a statement, the Vatican said the Pope received the Eucharist this afternoon "then dedicated himself to prayer".
He alternated between an oxygen mask and "long periods of high-flow oxygen," it added.
It said the Pope did not show signs of an increased white blood cell count, which can indicate infection or inflammation, and that his blood flow and circulation "remained stable".
The Pope also continued to eat and actively cooperated with regular "respiratory physiotherapy," it said.
Earlier, the Vatican said the Pope had a "peaceful night" and was resting, with an official adding: "I think he had coffee this morning."
Vatican sources had said the Pope's doctors needed 24 to 48 hours to determine whether there had been any damage or setback to his overall condition.
In an earlier statement on Friday evening, the Vatican said the Pope had "an isolated crisis of bronchospasm which, however, led to an episode of vomiting with inhalation and sudden worsening of the respiratory condition".
That health update came after a couple of days in which Vatican statements had been slightly more positive, talking of a "slight improvement" in the pontiff's condition.
He was given Communion on Friday morning.
In an earlier medical update, the Vatican stressed that the Pope would remain in Rome's Gemelli Hospital because of the "complex" clinical picture.
The level of detail from Vatican officials about the Pope's latest crisis is extraordinary.
This is now the longest the Pope has been in hospital – and the longest period in which he's been out of public sight – since he took over from Pope Benedict in 2013.
That makes many Roman Catholics nervous.
Previously, Italian TV channels were reporting that the Pope was "no longer critical", as that word disappeared from Vatican health updates recently and the Pope's health slipped down the news agenda.
Now it's back on the front pages, although news of the Ukrainian president's brutal dressing down in the Oval Office was the biggest story.
"Another crisis, Anxiety for the Pope" was Il Messaggero's headline, which also speaks of "prayers and tears" among Catholics gathered for evening prayers outside St Peter's Basilica.
"Vomit and breathing crisis: Anxiety for the Pope returns" was the headline in Il Giornale.
The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days.
He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.
The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal.
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church has been admitted to hospital multiple times during his 12-year tenure, including being treated for bronchitis at the same hospital in March 2023.
From Argentina, Pope Francis is the first Latin American, and first Jesuit, to lead the Roman Catholic Church.

Text: Two people have died after the vehicle they were travelling in crashed into the gable wall of a house in County Donegal.
It happened in the townland of Baltoney, Gortahork, on Friday night at about 21:30 local time.
The driver, who was in his teens, and a back seat passenger who was in his 20s were both pronounced dead at the scene.
The front seat passenger, aged in his 20s, and another back seat passenger in his teens were seriously injured.
They were taken to Letterkenny University Hospital for treatment.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that those who died have been named locally as Jamie Diver and Shaun McClafferty.
Gardaí (Irish police) and other emergency services attended the scene.
The road will remain closed on Saturday while forensic collision investigators carry out a technical examination of the crash site.
Gardaí have appealed to anyone who witnessed the crash, or has footage recorded in Baltoney around the time of the collision, to contact them.
Sinn Féin TD for Donegal Pearse Doherty said that the community had been left "completely heartbroken".
"At times like this, there are no words, but the community just comes together and wraps ourselves around all of those who are suffering the real loss here," he said.
Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil TD for Donegal Pat 'The Cope' Gallagher said that "a dark cloud descended over west Donegal when the news broke".
"This is a very tightly knit community that will stand in solidarity with these families during the weeks and months ahead," he added.
Separately, a motorcyclist aged in his 50s has died following a two-vehicle crash in Glenageary, County Dublin.
His bike was in collision with a car on Sallyglen Road at about 20:15 local time on Friday.
The car driver, a man in his 60s, was not injured.

Headline: 'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting

Text: Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.
For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.
"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president," Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.
"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."
Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.
Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.
Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.
"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude," says 30-year-old Andriy. "They don't respect the people of Ukraine."
"It looks like Washington supports Russia!" observes Dmytro, 26.
You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.
"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag," explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.
World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.
His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.
But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.
Not least with his warming to Russia.
The initial reaction was that of shock," says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.
"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world," she adds. "It's painful."
Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.
Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.
"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us," argues Sovsun.
There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.
"It's important to find the right mediator," she says. "Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.
"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."
President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.
"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress," she adds. "Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."
What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.
Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.
"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving," she says.
While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.
Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.
He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as "threats to national security" and "creating obstacles to economic development". Mr Poroshenko said it was "politically motivated".
Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.
As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.
Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.
"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east," says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.
After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.
"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes," he says.
As he ruthlessly pursues his "America First" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.
"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen," says Mr Chmut.
"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine."

Headline: Starmer speaks to Trump and Zelensky after White House row
Author: Jacqueline Howard & Emma Rossiter, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-01T10:54:01.818Z
Text: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has spoken to US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after a meeting between the two leaders in Washington descended into a row about US support for Ukraine.
The initially cordial White House talks ended in a furious row in front of the media, as Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart to be more thankful for US aid and accused him of "gambling with World War Three".
No 10 confirmed the prime minister had spoken with both presidents and that he retained "unwavering support for Ukraine".
On Sunday, Sir Keir will host a summit of European leaders to discuss an end to the war between Ukraine and Russia.
Zelensky arrived in the UK on Saturday ahead of the meeting, which will now be overshadowed by events in Washington.
Speaking on Friday, a No 10 spokesperson Sir Keir was "doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine".
The Oval Office spat also prompted words of support for Zelensky from key European allies, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there remains a "sliver of hope" for a peace deal.
"Trump wants a sustainable peace in Ukraine because he sees this as a very big part in his legacy and he wants that to last for many years," Hunt said.
"He doesn't want to withdraw from Ukraine and abandon it to the Russians in the way that the United States abandoned Afghanistan to the Taliban - he knows that would be very bad for his reputation, for America's reputation - so in the end he needs a ceasefire that both Zelensky and Putin are part of."
Hunt stressed that what was needed for negotiations to restart was "a little bit of time" for "tempers to cool down".
The heated clash in the Oval Office of the White House - in which both Trump and Zelensky interrupted each other repeatedly - was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a deal that would pave the way towards US access to Ukrainian minerals.
A news conference scheduled for later in the day was cancelled, and Zelensky was asked to leave the White House before the agreement could be signed.
In a later interview with Fox News, Zelensky said the public spat "was not good" - but the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged.
Writing on Telegram on Saturday, the Ukrainian leader said: "It is very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after."
Sir Keir's own meeting with Trump on Thursday took on a much more cordial mood.
The pair agreed to begin work on a new US-UK trade deal, and Trump appeared to have softened his stance towards Zelensky.
There had been speculation that Sir Keir had also gone into the visit seeking a US security "backstop" in a European-led peace plan for ending the war in Ukraine. However, the US president stopped short of making such a commitment.
Trump had previously criticised Sir Keir and France's Macron of having "done nothing" to seek an end to the war in Ukraine.
Reacting to Friday's far more acrimonious Oval Office meeting, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that "respectable diplomacy is essential for peace", adding that a "divided West only benefits Russia".
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey suggested Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance were "bullying the brave true patriot Zelensky into accepting a deal that effectively hands victory to Russia".
He also said that he was "proud that the UK has been Ukraine's staunchest ally from the start" but that the PM should "show British leadership on Ukraine by inviting President Zelensky to address Parliament on Monday".
The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said an offer of a second state visit - made during Starmer's White House visit - should be revoked.
Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the spat was "regrettable" and would "make Putin feel like the winner".
He added that it was "not the end of the story" and that a peace deal "with the right security guarantees" for Ukraine was "essential".
While reaction among US politicians appeared to largely fall along partisan lines, in Ukraine there was broad appreciation for Zelensky holding his ground over what many Ukrainians see as an existential war.
Russia, meanwhile, said Trump and Vance had acted with restraint.

Text: Friday's drama in the Oval Office sparked a swift reaction from many world leaders.
But not from Vladimir Putin. There's been no comment so far from the Kremlin leader.
Then again, he doesn't really need to say anything. President Putin can afford to sit back and watch events unfold.
Donald Trump predicted that the very public spat with President Zelensky was "going to be great television".
There's little doubt that Vladimir Putin will have enjoyed the "show", the dramatic spectacle of Volodymyr Zelensky, leader of the country President Putin invaded, being berated by the president and vice-president of the United States in front of the world's media.
Some Russian officials have commented, though, on events in Washington.
In a post on social media, former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Russian security council, wrote that President Zelensky had received "a slap down in the Oval Office". He called on the US to stop military assistance to Ukraine.
How Moscow would welcome that.
Writing on Telegram, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised Trump and JD Vance for their "miracle of restraint" at not hitting Ukraine's president.
It's a sign of the new world in which we seem to be now that, while US-Ukraine relations are at risk of implosion, the opposite is true for US-Russia ties.
In recent weeks, Trump and Putin have spoken on the phone and pledged to work closely together; there's talk of a possible summit sometime soon; lower-level US-Russia talks to reset relations and discuss potential economic cooperation have already started.
President Putin has dangled the carrot of lucrative joint projects with the Americans involving rare earth minerals and aluminium production.
The implications of a breakdown in relations between Ukraine and the US are potentially very serious for Kyiv, but very positive for Moscow.
If the flow of American weapons to Ukraine were to stop, it would be much harder for Ukrainians to defend themselves against the Russian forces who have invaded their country, even if Ukraine enjoys solidarity and strong support from European leaders.
For some time now, Moscow has believed that the war in Ukraine has been going Russia's way. The shouting-match in the Oval Office will have cemented that view.

Headline: Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky: The comedian who became a wartime leader
Author: Stephen Mulvey & James Gregory, BBC News

Text: Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky was a comedian with no political experience when he announced that he would be running in Ukraine's 2019 presidential election.
Six years later, he is an embattled wartime leader navigating a huge geopolitical upheaval as Donald Trump brings to an end years of strong American support for Ukraine.
Zelensky has been a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russian aggression. Slava Ukraini, or Glory to Ukraine, has been his battle cry since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022.
Much of the world rallied behind him - he received several standing ovations after his address to the US Congress asking for American support.
But just three years later, he finds himself in uncertain territory, with US President Donald Trump calling him a dictator and the US siding with Russia in votes at the UN to mark the third anniversary of the Ukraine war.
Zelensky's trip to Washington at the end of February, during which he was expected to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources with the US, ended in acrimony. He was told to leave the White House after an angry exchange with Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance.
Zelensky's arrival on the political scene was a case of life imitating art.
Ironically, Zelensky's most celebrated role as a comic actor was playing a school teacher who was catapulted into the presidency on the TV series, Servant of the People.
Cut to real life, and his election candidacy, aged 41, was initially seen by some as a joke - his political party is even called Servant of the People.
But he won with a landslide 73% of the vote, promising to fight corruption and bring peace in the east of Ukraine.
Sceptics feared Zelensky would turn out to be a puppet leader, controlled by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who backed his campaign and had been under investigation for fraud and money laundering.
But Zelensky proved to be more independent than his doubters thought, and the anti-corruption drive by his administration has had some success.
Many Ukrainians also viewed Zelensky's rhetoric on the conflict in the eastern Donbas region and relations with Russia as too timid, says communications consultant Yaryna Klyuchkovska.
As the drumbeat of war grew louder, Zelensky continued to emphasise his hopes for a diplomatic solution, even while Ukraine was reporting a rapid increase in ceasefire violations along the front line.
His attempts to negotiate with Russia had only limited success.
There were prisoner exchanges and moves towards implementing parts of a peace process, known as the Minsk agreements, but no breakthrough. Throughout 2020 his approval rating steadily fell.
There was a notable shift in tone at the Munich Security Conference in February 2022, when Zelensky laid bare the threat his country was facing, and accused the West of appeasing a resurgent Russia.
No Ukrainian leader had spoken so bluntly to the West before, according to Ms Klyuchkovska.
Then, on 24 February 2022 - just hours before Russia first began bombarding Ukraine's cities - came a key moment.
In a sober address posted on social media, speaking partly in Russian, Zelensky said he had tried to call Vladimir Putin to avert a war, and had been met by silence.
The two countries didn't need a war, he said, but if Ukrainians came under attack they would defend themselves.
"When you attack us you will see our faces - not our backs, but our faces."
For his next broadcast after Russia had invaded, he wore military fatigues, reflecting the country's David-versus-Goliath struggle.
That evening he made another address, warning Western leaders that if they did not help, tomorrow "war will knock on your doors".
Zelensky's nightly video addresses became a source of hope and comfort for millions of Ukrainians during the ongoing fighting. His ability to connect was perhaps most evident when he posted a defiant video of himself with several top advisers in Kyiv, after Russia falsely claimed he had fled the capital.
"We are here," he repeated. "We are in Kyiv. We are protecting Ukraine."
Zelensky quickly became a national figurehead, with a high of 90% approval ratings in the immediate aftermath of the invasion.
The war has understandably taken an emotional toll on Zelensky's family. His wife, Olena Zelenska, and their two children spent months living in secret locations for their own safety. The four have spent very little time together since the start of the conflict.
Further afield, Zelensky has seen it as his mission to galvanise support for Ukraine, leaning on his western allies to provide aid and fast-track his country's membership of Nato.
In between visits to the front line, he has spoken with foreign leaders to lobby support and attended conferences across the globe, pleading for help.
One of the most striking and enduring images from the early months of the war was his visit in April 2022 to the outer Kyiv suburb town of Bucha - where Russian troops are suspected of committing hundreds of war crimes.
His first foreign trip after the invasion came in December 2022 when he went to the US to visit then-President Joe Biden - unsurprising given Washington had been Kyiv's largest backer.
During that trip, Zelensky received several standing ovations when he addressed Congress and told them: "Against all odds... Ukraine is alive and kicking" and will "never surrender".
Biden also promised further support to Ukraine, saying the American people were prepared to "have us stand up to bullies".
But Zelensky has cut a frustrated figure at times over the speed at which he has received western support - as well as the reluctance to approve the use of some weapons on the front line.
Even in the first few months of the conflict, it was clear there would be pushback from some Republican Party quarters over how much support the US should give.
Three years on, and with a different president in the White House, there appears to be a deepening rift between the two countries.
Zelensky has long maintained that talks about Ukraine's future should be conducted with Ukraine at the table. But the Americans have instead met with Russian officials to discuss the war - and Ukraine wasn't there.
Zelensky has accused the US of helping Putin to "break out of years of isolation" and said Donald Trump lives in a "Russian disinformation space".
Meanwhile, Trump has turned his ire on Zelensky, calling him a "dictator" - echoing Russia's claims - and criticising the fact that Ukraine has not held an election since 2019.
A vote was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since the invasion began, a decision that was broadly backed by the opposition and the Ukrainian population.
Zelensky has suggested he would be willing to resign as leader in return for Ukraine's membership of Nato.
Trump also took aim at Zelensky's approval rating. It is true that his popularity has dipped over the years, but as Yaryna Klyuchkovska noted, for someone who started with such a high approval rating - the only way was down.
Even so, while polling is limited in Ukraine because millions have fled and Russia occupies about a fifth of the country, a recent survey suggested Zelensky still has the support of 57% of Ukrainians.
Russia's war on Ukraine has lasted far longer than Moscow intended - Putin had hoped to take Ukraine within a matter of days of launching what it calls its "special military operation".
Three years since the start of the invasion, and while Russia continues to make territorial gains, Ukraine has managed to slow the advance and even mount a counter-offensive inside Russia itself.
Ukraine's future is still uncertain, but Zelensky remains defiant in the face of Russian aggression.

Text: In the immediate hours after those astonishing exchanges between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House, European leaders, one after another, offered their public support for Ukraine.
But the prime minister remained silent.
Then, as I dashed into the studio for the BBC News at Ten, my phone went.
I had been sent a statement from No 10: Sir Keir Starmer had spoken to them both and the prime minister "retains unwavering support for Ukraine and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace".
Friday afternoon in the White House had not only entirely upended in the most spectacular fashion the relationship between two allies - America and Ukraine - but the diplomacy of recent days too, with the visits of President Emmanuel Macron of France and then the prime minister to the White House.
Just 24 hours before Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the Oval Office, I had stood there in the same room witnessing Trump and Sir Keir's warmth and bonhomie: what a contrast to what was to come next.
Sir Keir, like Emmanuel Macron before him, had sought to ingratiate himself with the wildly unpredictable American president, convinced that was the pragmatic course of action.
Now the prime minister confronts a situation where two of the UK's allies are at loggerheads in the most public and angry way.
Sources are tight-lipped about the precise nature of the two phone calls Sir Keir made on Friday night, very aware of the acute sensitivities of this delicate situation.
But the UK's diplomatic efforts in recent weeks at least allowed those calls to be possible, allowing the UK to attempt to act as a bridge between both Kyiv and Washington, and Washington and Europe.
It comes, though, at some political cost. The government's domestic critics such as the Scottish National Party argue that the invitation for Donald Trump to come to the UK on a second state visit should be rescinded.
Sunday's summit of European leaders in London, hosted by the prime minister and attended by President Zelensky, was already shaping up to be crucial. It has now taken on further importance.
To give you a sense of that, Trade Minister Douglas Alexander told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions that not only were the scenes in the Oval Office "deeply troubling and sobering" but demonstrated "in the starkest possible terms" the extent to which "the world we've all experienced for the last 80 years" had changed, adding we that were in "uncharted waters".
He also called President Zelensky the "bravest political leader in Europe since Winston Churchill".
And the European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said that it had "become clear that the free world needs a new leader. It is up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge."
But that is the crux of this. Is Europe capable of that?
At the heart of the UK and others' request of America is that the White House provides a security guarantee to Ukraine under any peace deal.
The UK wants that to amount to air cover. This would be a big ask of any president at any time, with the danger of conflict escalating with Russia.
But it is a colossal ask of a president who has made it abundantly clear he has no appetite whatsoever for American foreign military adventures.
Which brings us to this weekend and President Zelensky joining his European allies in the UK.
There is a colossal amount at stake.

Headline: Were Tate brothers released in secret deal - or is the truth far more chaotic?
Author: Andrew Harding, BBC News, Reporting fromBucharest

Text: These were already turbulent times in Romania.
But as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.
A country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.
Was a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?
Or are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?
As foreign leaders – from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer – travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?
"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania," said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin.
Declining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages – commercial, diplomatic, and military – of continuing to back it.
But if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.
This is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens – a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.
So, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.
"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance," fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of "external influence."
"It's my personal perception that probably there is… pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return)," said international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.
It is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House.
Many in the so-called "manosphere" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.
There is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.
But the picture is not clear cut.
President Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are "not welcome" in his state, amid plans to open a "preliminary inquiry" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.
Meanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.
"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty," said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a "coherent" policy concerning the Tates.
"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure," said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level "satellite" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order "to extract money from the Tate brothers." The BBC has seen no evidence of this.
"It's very depressing to see," he added.
As for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.
The fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a "conspiracy" against them.
And while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face "no active indictment" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.
"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved," said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case.
The brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.
In the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate – often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.
With their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond.
Clearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.

Headline: Can the tide turn on the Channel migrant boat crossings?

Text: On France's northern coast, they call the people smuggling and dangerous dinghies phenomenon, La Crise Migratoire.
But do the UK and France now have a chance of consigning the small boats to history?
Somewhat eclipsed by events this week in Washington, Yvette Cooper became the first British home secretary in five years to go to the French coast to see for herself how £540m of British taxpayers' money is being used to tackle people smuggling gangs.
She was the guest of her French counterpart, interior minister Bruno Retailleau.
The fact that he invited his British opposite number to the frontline of a deeply sensitive problem for both countries speaks volumes.
Rather than slinging English Channel mud at each other, this diplomatic rapprochement began with a warm embrace in the cold morning air of Le Touquet airport - and ended with both feeling they may be on the verge of breakthroughs.
In the first seven weeks of this year, successful crossings have been down by 41% on the same period of 2024. As the weather improves, both governments know that could be reversed.
The optimism comes not from the daily statistics, but what the French and British believe is an increasingly slick coastal operation that may be making it harder for people smugglers to offer crossings to migrants making their way to the coast.
The Conservatives maintain there is no real deterrent to come to the Channel - because the government cancelled the deeply controversial Rwanda plan. And everyone who works with refugees says that people in genuine need of protection will have to turn to smugglers until the UK comes up with safe routes for them.
The roots of the feeling that things could now change were planted in the 2018 Sandhurst Treaty, signed when the Conservative's Theresa May was prime minister.
The UK promised that year to fund coastal security operations against smugglers and this year Paris will receive around £172m. Tough negotiations are continuing over what happens from 2027.
On Thursday, Cooper saw what that cash is buying: boots on the ground and an awful lot of kit and technology.
The French have 1,200 security personnel deployable daily on coastal smuggler operations. Some 730 of them are paid for by the British.
At the local headquarters of the Gendarmerie Nationale, the military police teams now wear a Nato-like "Mission Small Boat" sleeve badge.
They put on a good show for their British visitors - and told some grim stories of shoreline violence and rescues - but the real action is beyond the parade ground.
French pilots are now in the air most days, using thermal cameras to spot migrants in the dunes.
Drones move rapidly over wild coastline, providing pictures back to small mobile units of officers in military-grade beach buggies.
All of this kit and other tools aim to stop three things from coming together: migrants, the flimsy dinghies and the low-powered engines to power a crossing.
The engines and low-grade vessels are brought at speed in vans from up to four hours away in Germany. The migrants meet the gear, assemble it and put to sea in minutes.
The French say their teams have become more adept at reaching dinghies and destroying them in the dunes, but the migrants try to repel the police with missiles until they've launched.
This places the French police in a bind: They are trying to save lives. They cannot shoot people just because they are desperate.
So this is a daily race. But here's why both sides think things may move their way.
The average number of migrants per boat is now often up to 100 people.
The cramming suggests the gangs are moving to fewer launches because that's easier to evade detection.
Launch locations began to include estuaries a staggering 60km away from the Dover Strait - so the police countered with barrages and dams - and now they're gathering intelligence from train stations about how the migrants are moving around the region.
So the gangs changed again and are now opting for "taxi boats".
Quite simply, one or two migrants get the craft quietly into the water and then pick up others as they wait offshore in the surf.
It's pictures of these craft struggling to get out of the waves on the Pas de Calais' beautiful and wild beaches that have enraged the French as much as the British and led many to ask why the police don't just stop them.
France's relatively new interior minister told me this week he now wants to change complex maritime rules to allow his land-based units to intercept these taxi-boats as they sit in shallow waters. This is what the British have asked the French to do for years.
He is also proposing a new offence of illegal residence - but beach push-backs could be the game changer: no boats means no business - and that means no profit.
All of that is a big if - but it is not the only tactic now potentially bearing down on the gangs.
The UK's National Crime Agency understands better than before how gangs bring the boats and engines from Germany to France.
If the intelligence on these vans can get to the French in time, the Gendarmes can intercept and destroy the cargo.
Germany meanwhile has agreed to make it a crime to facilitate illegal immigration to the UK.
That is a really big deal because it would mean police could raid the warehouses storing the dinghies.
Bulgarian customs officials have shown that existing laws can be used to seize consignment of dinghies as they enter the EU from Turkey - and the icing on the cake for the British would be if China seized the cheap engines which have no place in the legitimate maritime market.
The two countries are talking, but there's nothing confirmed there yet.
While those conversations continue, the UK's legal plans to criminalise actions that prepare the way for a crossing - such as funding, advertising and other logistical arrangements - will go through Parliament.
Another key feature in the package means jail for anyone endangers lives at sea by attacking the police units on the French beaches or obstructs a rescue.
If La Crise Migratoire is going to end, all of these individual initiatives, legal reforms and technological solutions need to work together.
But there is genuine optimism that this could be the year when things begin to change.

Headline: Irish PM 'delighted' by Trump's White House invite

Text: The taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) has been invited to the White House by US President Donald Trump to celebrate St Patrick's Day next month.
The meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before the Irish public holiday.
"I have never met Donald Trump, but I am looking forward to meeting with him," Micheál Martin said on RTÉ's The Late Late Show on Friday night.
"We have to keep engaging with the United States," he said.
The meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before the Irish public holiday.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Martin received the invitation in a letter from the US president.
It said Trump's letter congratulated the taoiseach on his recent appointment and highlighted the special bond between the Irish and American people.
During Friday night's Late Late Show, Martin also described a clash between the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the US president as "extraordinary".
The meeting ended early and a planned press conference was cancelled after the two leaders disagreed over the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
"This has been a huge unsettling setback today, there's no question about that," Martin said.
Martin and Zelensky met at Shannon Airport in County Clare on Thursday, where Martin said that Ireland is committed to helping Ukraine financially.
It is customary for Irish leaders to travel to the US every March for an audience with the president at the White House.
They present their host with a bowl of shamrock - a tradition that dates back to President Harry Truman in 1952.
Martin is serving his second term as taoiseach, having previously led his country from June 2020 to December 2022.
However, he was not able to visit the White House on St Patrick's Day in 2021 because of Covid travel restrictions.
He did make the trip to Washington DC in March 2022 but he could not visit the White House in person because he contracted Covid while in the US.
As a result, Martin's previous St Patrick's Day duties as taoiseach consisted of video calls with Trump's predecessor Joe Biden.
The annual Washington visit is viewed as an important political opportunity to strengthen US and Irish diplomatic relations and boost cross-Atlantic trade.
The Republic of Ireland is particularly vulnerable to threats of US tariffs on European imports and Trump's "America First" policy.
In 2023, the US was the number-one country for Irish goods exports, buying products worth €54bn.
That meant just over a quarter of Irish goods exports were sold into this one market.
Earlier this week, Trump said he was planning to impose tariffs of about 25% on goods made in the European Union, of which Ireland is member.
On Thursday, the Tánaiste (deputy PM) Simon Harris told the Dáil (Irish Parliament) it has never been a more important time for ministers to travel abroad for talks.
Almost 40 Irish ministers and other state officials will make St Patrick's Day trips to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand.
Visiting Trump in the White House can also have political perils at home, however, because of his controversial foreign policy announcements.
In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said they would boycott the White House this St Patrick's Day because of Trump's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict.
The Alliance Party has also confirmed they will not attend the events, but Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly is going to Washington DC.
Asked about her plans, Little-Pengelly said it was important to "maintain long and rewarding" relationships with the US.
"It's important we engage regardless of what our personal views may or may not be. That's what I'll be doing on St Patrick's Day," she added.

Headline: Search for missing six-year-old at Drogheda house ends

Text: A search at a house in Drogheda, County Louth, as part of the investigation into the murder of a six-year-old boy who disappeared more than two years ago, has come to an end.
Gardaí (Irish police) said the results of the search are not being released for operational purposes.
Kyran Durnin was reported missing at the end of last summer but gardaí believe he may have been killed more than two years earlier.
Gardaí commenced a murder investigation in October 2024, saying they were treating Kyran as missing, presumed dead.
That same month they carried out a dig at his former family home in Emer Terrace, Dundalk, but there was no sign of his body.
On Wednesday, a white cordon was erected around a house on Hand Street in Drogheda.
Officers from the Garda Technical Bureau undertook a forensic examination of the property, including the rear garden and a mini-digger was used to excavate land.
The search lasted for two days.
Kyran had been a pupil at the national [primary] school near his home in Dundalk until the summer of 2022.
He did not return to class after the summer holidays and it is understood authorities were told he was moving to Northern Ireland and to a new school in Newry.
Tusla, the Irish state agency responsible for child welfare and protection, said it received no referrals or concern about Kyran's attendance or educational welfare between 2022 and 2024.
In December, two houses were searched in Drogheda. One of the searches involved the use of a cadaver dog.
The results of the searches were not made public.
The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris previously said he had never seen a case like this in his 40-year career in policing on both sides of the border.

Headline: Czech firefighters tackle large toxic train fire

Text: A freight train carrying the highly toxic chemical benzene has derailed in the Czech Republic, sparking a huge fire.
Several tankers and a locomotive were ablaze, with firefighters from several regions and a mobile chemical laboratory deployed to the area, according to local media. A massive cloud of dense black smoke was visible for several kilometres.
Railway officials say nobody was injured in the incident, which occurred near Hustopeče nad Bečvou, 50km (31 miles) south-west of the Polish border, on Friday.
Benzene, which is a cancer-causing substance for humans, is an element present in aircraft fuel.
The train "split apart" and subsequently derailed, according to initial reports. A nearby electric substation also caught fire, killing power to the nearby town of Hustopeče.
Flames up to 20m high were visible when the fire broke out, one eyewitness told the Lidove Noviny newspaper.
Dramatic drone footage from the scene, released by the Czech fire service, shows several badly charred and destroyed tankers - some still burning as thick black smoke spews into the sky.
Firefighters used heavy foam to prevent the fire spreading further, while other tankers were hosed down to prevent more explosions.
A helicopter was also deployed, as well as a special chemical monitoring mobile lab. It took several hours to bring the fire under control, officials said.
The fire affected around 15 of the 17 benzene tanks the train had been transporting, a fire department spokesperson told local media.
"The substance should be the same in all tankers, the amount will be specified, but it is approximately 60 tonnes in one tanker. However, this does not mean that everything will burn out or leak," Lucie Balážová said.
The fire service later said the estimated cost of the damage the fire had caused was 125 million Czech koruna (£4.1m).
Locals have been told to stay indoors and not open windows or doors. Officials say air quality "has not yet exceeded" any pollution limits, according to Czech news website iDNES.
Police say they will investigate the cause of the derailment.
Benzene is a colourless or light-yellow liquid with a sweet smell that can evaporate very quickly. It is used in common substances like plastic, resin, nylon and some forms of dyes, pesticides or detergents. It is very flammable.
Exposure to benzene through breathing or ingestion can cause symptoms like drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, vomiting or sleeplessness.
Very high levels of exposure can lead to unconsciousness or death, according to the CDC. Long-term exposure of a year or more could cause issues with blood, bone marrow or the immune system.

Headline: Greeks hold mass protests demanding justice after train tragedy

Text: Greeks have held their largest protests in years and took part in a general strike to mark the second anniversary of a rail disaster that left 57 dead and dozens more injured.
In the centre of Athens alone the crowd was put at hundreds of thousands, and big numbers were seen in Thessaloniki, Larissa and Ioannina, as well as many other cities.
"For those of us who had children on that train, a part of our soul remained there and will never return," said Maria Karystianou, the head of the Tempi victims' association, whose daughter Marthi was among those killed in the tragedy.
An inquiry concluded on Thursday that the accident was caused by human error, poor maintenance, and inadequate staffing.
By early afternoon, a group of hooded men began to throw rocks and petrol bombs at police, marring the emotional atmosphere close to parliament.
Police in riot gear responded with tear gas and water cannon as clashes went on for some time around the centre of the capital, in Ermou, Omonia and Propylaia.
Dozens of people were arrested and the trouble flared up again as evening fell.
The violence cast a shadow over the enormous scale of protests in virtually every city in Greece.
"I am here in memory of the people who were killed in the train crash. We demand justice," said 13-year-old Dimitris who had come with his father Petros Polyzos to the largest rally in Greece, in Syntagma Square in downtown Athens.
It was during the night of 28 February 2023 that a passenger train packed with students collided head-on with a goods train near the Tempi gorge in central Greece.
The report by Greece's Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority warned that the safety failings exposed by the crash had not yet been addressed. "Those children were killed because the train was not safe," said the authority's chief Christos Papadimitriou.
The Tempi rail disaster shocked Greeks with many accusing their conservative government of doing too little to shed light on the causes of the tragedy. There is a widely held belief that the government has sought to cover up the role of high-ranking officials.
The entire centre of Athens was crowded with people of all ages and all walks of life, with many saying they were attending a demonstration for the first time in their lives.
Dmitris and his father were among many protesters in Athens, wearing t-shirts that read "I have no oxygen - justice to the end", referring to the 57 who died.
Rallies were being organised in 346 cities, across Greece in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Patras and Larissa, as well as in cities across Europe, including Brussels, Rome and several cities in the UK.
The passenger service from Athens to Thessaloniki was crowded with students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent when the train collided with a goods train on the same track outside Larisa.
Seconds afterwards a fireball almost completely destroyed the first two carriages of the train.
In Athens, protesters held placards reading "My child, call me when you arrive" and "No cover-up".
What happened at the Tempi rail disaster?
Dina Gazi, 62, held white balloons with the names of those who died in the accident. "I firmly believe that the government is covering up those responsible for the accident", she told BBC. "We demand that all the evidence come to light."
Shops in the centre had their shutters down, many with messages of sympathy and support in their windows, and ordinary people did not go to work.
Schools were closed, flights and trains cancelled, and the only public transport still operating was taking people to and from Syntagma Square.
Taxi drivers promised to take people to the protest without charge.
In a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everyone's thoughts were with the families of the 57 victims who died, as well as with the wounded and those who survived but carried the memory of that night.
"Nothing will ever be the same any more," he added, speaking of "fatal human errors coupled with chronic shortcomings of the state".
In office for almost six years, this is the first time since Mitsotakis was elected that he has been in such a difficult political position. He promised to move "more dynamically and quickly" to bring about modern and safe trains.
For Greeks this mass protest was unusual in that it was unrelated to the economy and their personal finances.
Thursday's inquiry found that millions of euros had been paid out to cover the installation of safety systems along the railway, but that the project remained incomplete due to corruption and bureaucracy.
Relatives of those killed in the crash believe the goods train may have been carrying contraband fuel on behalf of a smuggling ring.
"It is impossible to determine what exactly caused [the fireball], but simulations and expert reports indicate the possible presence of a hitherto unknown fuel," the report found.
"Serious information went missing because the site of the accident was not sealed," experts say, increasing public anger and heightening speculation of a cover-up.
Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis denied there was a cover-up and said the allegation was not backed up by the report.
Further allegations have surfaced suggesting orders were given to clear the crash site and "landfill" it days after the disaster, which meant that evidence disappeared. But Marinakis said the inquiry report concluded that no political directive was give to alter the scene.
As he stood in the midst of Friday's protest in Syntagma Square, Pavlos Aslanidis spoke about the death of his 26-year-old son Dimitris in the Tempi accident.
"I don't know how I find the strength to stand," he told BBC.
"My son gives me the strength. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here today demanding justice."

Headline: Thousands of speeding fines quashed over camera error
Author: Kevin Sharkey, BBC News NI Dublin Reporter
Published Date: 2025-02-28T17:19:56.316Z
Text: Almost 2,000 motorists in the Republic of Ireland are to have speeding fines and penalty points quashed.
The decision has been taken because the speeding was detected by an uncertified speed camera.
Some 1,871 drivers were caught speeding on the N17 in County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland between 20 December 2024 and 12 February 2025.
They were all issued with fixed charge notices.
The speeding was detected by a static speed safety camera system, and it is standard procedure for all cameras used for speeding detection to have valid calibration certificates issued by the GoSafe camera provider.
Gardaí (Irish police) have explained that in conjunction with GoSafe they discovered that the camera, located near the town of Claremorris, was fully functional and accurately identifying offences, but it was not certified.
This discovery was made on 12 February and the decision to quash fines and points was announced on Friday.
Some of the motorists who were caught speeding on the busy road have already paid fines and they will now be refunded.
A full breakdown of the figures shows that 800 notices were paid and penalty points applied while a further 123 fines were paid but the error was identified before these drivers were given penalty points.
Garda Ch Supt Jane Humphries said "this error is very much regretted".
However, she added: "The level of speeding breaches issued since the camera went operational on December 20, 2024 demonstrates the continued need for all motorists using this road to slow down."
A spokesperson for the camera provider said: "At GoSafe, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and safety. During a routine quality assurance check, we identified that the calibration certificate for radar components in a static speed camera on the N17 in Mayo had expired."
"To prevent a recurrence, we have implemented enhanced safeguards within our quality assurance process," the spokesperson added.
Motorists impacted by error are now being notified by gardaí.
The speed safety camera system went live on 20 December 2024.
It was not operational between 1 January 2025 and 17 January 2025 as it had been vandalised.
This means that all the 1,871 speeding notices were issued over a period of 39 operational days.
The N17 became part of Irish folklore after an Irish band, The Saw Doctors, released a song of the same name around 1990.
It was a nostalgic Irish emigration song at the height of mass emigration from the country and the band subsequently became hugely popular in Ireland and among Irish communities in the UK and US as well as in other parts of the world.

Headline: Minister questions why Tate brothers were allowed to leave Romania
Author: Nick Thorpe &, Eastern Europe correspondent, Reporting fromBucharest, Hafsa Khalil, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon
Published Date: 2025-02-28T15:57:24.153Z
Text: Romania's Justice Minister Radu Marinescu has called for a public explanation into why controversial social media influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate were allowed to leave the country on Thursday.
The brothers - who are currently facing charges including human trafficking in Romania - had been under a travel ban for more than two years before it was lifted, allowing them to fly to the US.
Marinescu has asked the special prosecution service, Diicot, to "conduct any investigation necessary to uncover the truth promptly, correctly, and impartially".
Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them.
The brothers are dual US-UK citizens, and were first arrested in Romania in 2022, where they are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.
They spent several months under house arrest in Romania, before prosecutors announced on Thursday that the travel ban had been lifted and the pair's US passports had been returned to them.
Despite this, investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania.
In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities.
The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking.
On Friday, four British women who have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control urged the UK government to "immediately request Tate's extradition from the US to the UK to face justice".
They said in a joint statement that if it did not, "it won't just be us it will be failing, but all British victims of alleged sexual violence".
They added: "We do not doubt the home secretary's personal commitment to victims of sexual violence, but we need action, not words."
The brothers' exit has sparked concerns that Romanian prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. On Thursday, the US president said he knew nothing about their release.
Romania's justice minister said the Tate brothers "risk pre-trial detention" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them.
But international human rights lawyer Silvia Tabusca, who has been following the proceedings, does not believe the brothers will return to Romania.
She told the BBC Andrew Tate was "technically correct" when, upon arriving in Florida, he said there was no live indictment against him and his brother, because a second case has not yet been presented to a judge.
In December 2024, the Court of Appeals in Bucharest ruled that an original indictment - the first case - which was issued in June 2023 could not proceed to trial in its current form.
In August, Romanian authorities began a second investigation over new allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.
When both cases have been submitted to the court, they will become live.
"It's actually a sort of lull in the two cases against them," Ms Tabusca explained.
"A big question mark hangs over whether they will ever return there to face trial, what the US government would do in such a situation, and what pressure the UK government is putting on the US to extradite them to the UK to face trial on another set of charges there."
Romania's justice minister said the Tate brothers "risk pre-trial detention" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them.
"There are legal mechanisms in place to resolve this situation," Marinescu said, which could be a reference to the extradition treaty between the US and Romania.
Calls for a public explanation of why their travel ban was lifted comes as many Romanians express concern that there appears to be one law for the rich and influential, and another for ordinary citizens.

Headline: Dozens arrested in global hit against AI-generated child abuse

Text: At least 25 arrests have been made during a worldwide operation against child abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the European Union's law enforcement organisation Europol has said.
The suspects were part of a criminal group whose members engaged in distributing fully AI-generated images of minors, according to the agency.
The operation is one of the first involving such child sexual abuse material (CSAM), Europol said. The lack of national legislation against these crimes made it "exceptionally challenging for investigators", it added.
Arrests were made simultaneously on Wednesday 26 February during Operation Cumberland, led by Danish law enforcement, a statement said.
Authorities from at least 18 other countries have been involved and the operation is still continuing, with more arrests expected in the next few weeks, Europol said.
In addition to the arrests, so far 272 suspects have been identified, 33 house searches have been conducted and 173 electronic devices have been seized, according to the agency.
It also said the main suspect was a Danish national who was arrested in November 2024.
The statement said he "ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced".
After making a "symbolic online payment", users from around the world were able to get a password that allowed them to "access the platform and watch children being abused".
The agency said online child sexual exploitation was one of the top priorities for the European Union's law enforcement organisations, which were dealing with "an ever-growing volume of illegal content".
Europol added that even in cases when the content was fully artificial and there was no real victim depicted, such as with Operation Cumberland, "AI-generated CSAM still contributes to the objectification and sexualisation of children".
Europol's executive director Catherine De Bolle said: "These artificially generated images are so easily created that they can be produced by individuals with criminal intent, even without substantial technical knowledge."
She warned law enforcement would need to develop "new investigative methods and tools" to address the emerging challenges.
The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced and becoming more prevalent on the open web.
In research last year the charity found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.
Experts say AI child sexual abuse material can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.

Text: Thirty-two people were deported from the Republic of Ireland to Georgia on a chartered flight on Thursday night.
It was the first operation conducted under a contract signed by the Republic last November for the provision of charter flights for deportations.
All of those taken to Tbilisi on the flight were Georgian nationals who had been subject to deportation orders.
The group was made up of 28 men, three women and a child who was with their parents.
"A central priority for me and this government is that our immigration laws are robust and enforced," Irish Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan said.
"People are entitled to have confidence in our immigration system and there must be consequences for individuals who refuse to leave the state when they are ordered to do so."
He said Thursday's flight was "a significant start in ensuring that deportation orders are enforced and part of a more effective immigration system generally.
"There will be further flights scheduled in the future."
Gardai (police), medical staff, an interpreter and a human rights observer were also onboard the flight.
Mr O'Callaghan said when a person's application for asylum is refused or they are found to have no permission to be in the state, they are offered assistance to return home voluntarily.
If they do not do so, they are liable to be deported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, he added.
The Irish Department of Justice said access to chartered flights "has significantly increased the capacity of An Garda Síochána to effect removals".
Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said: "Yesterday, the Garda National Immigration Bureau of An Garda Síochána, in a planned operation, carried out the removal of 32 persons from Ireland to Georgia.
"This was the largest removal operation carried out by GNIB in over six years. A
"An Garda Síochána continues to play its role in enforcing immigration legislation and maintaining the security and integrity of our borders."
Minister of State for Migration Colm Brophy said: "Chartered deportation flights will now form an important part of removing people who do not have a right to remain in our country.
"I look forward to now seeing chartered flights in conjunction with voluntary deportations, ensuring that we will have a firm and effective system in place to deal with deportations going forward."

Text: The girlfriend of a man, who is fighting for his life in hospital after being savagely beaten, says he cannot walk, talk or breathe for himself and will never be the same again.
Charles Dooher, a 26-year-old farmer from Lifford in County Donegal, was at home when a masked gang beat him with iron bars and other weapons on 20 January.
Charlotte Gallen said it is heartbreaking to see her partner clinging to life.
They had dreams of getting married and having children but now, she says, the future looks uncertain.
He suffered severe head injuries in the attack and is on life support in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.
His father, also named Charles, was assaulted too.
His girlfriend of five years, Ms Gallen, described it as a "a brutal and vicious attack".
"I feel that it was targeted and organised and they entered the home armed with weapons. They beat him on the back of the head.
"They actually cable tied his sister and threw her in her bedroom. And they also beat his father too and left him with injuries."
Warning: Contains distressing details
She told BBC News NI her boyfriend has a severe traumatic brain injury.
"He actually has one of the worst head injuries that the top neurosurgeons and doctors in the Royal had ever seen," she said.
"He's left without half of his skull and he has life-changing injuries that are going to affect him for the rest of his life," she added.
"Can you imagine seeing man of his build who has always been strong and capable of doing anything he has put his mind to laying in a bed having to be peg fed (using a feeding tube) because he can't swallow and is not able to walk, he can't talk, he can't do anything, he can't even breathe for himself.
"You are seeing a man that's so strong and provides you with safety and comfort laying in such a vulnerable position."
She wants people to think about how they would feel in this situation if it was one of their loved ones.
"Somebody, somewhere knows something," she said.
She urged anyone with any information to consider sharing it.
The Dooher family was critical of the Garda (Irish police) investigation into the attack at their home outside Lifford.
They claim they had been subjected to various threats over the years and robust action was not taken.
A spokesperson for the Gardai said: "An Garda Siochána does not comment on the detail of interactions with families. And Garda Siochána will continue to liaise with the family."
A family statement, from solicitor Ciaran Shiels, said the family was "a close, hard-working, law abiding family with respect for the law".
Charles Dooher's sister Deborah, a nurse, says those responsible should be ashamed of themselves.
She believes there has been an "an exchange of money" involved in the attack.
"They went to Charles' room as he was getting ready to go to the gym and delivered several deadly blows to the back of his skull fracturing it, to the extent that you drop a porcelain plate on the floor."
She said that, even as a medical professional, the extent of his injuries have been shocking.
Deborah said her brother is in "constant severe pain".
"I think somebody would have to absolutely hate my brother and want him dead to cause that extent of injury.
"As a nurse I've seen a lot of people in a lot of pain. I've seen people fight cancer. I've seen families in a lot of pain.
"Usually it's because someone has been sick and usually it's because of a normal or somewhat normal circumstance."
Charlotte Gallen says she and Charles had planned on getting married and having children but those dreams now appear to be shattered by this horrendous attack, she believes.
"The plans we'd made they seem so far away. We may never get to do the things that we dreamed of doing together."
Ms Gallen has been by his bedside since the attack.
"I've been praying endlessly for him to make a full recovery physically and psychologically. It's just been traumatising and I don't think any of us will recover from this."
She said that the perpetrators are "callous and evil".
"He's an innocent man. He's an honest working man. I think they have a lot to think about when they go to sleep at night."
Gardaí said their investigation is continuing and renewed their appeal for any witnesses to come forward.
Officers are especially keen for anyone who may have dash cam footage of a silver or grey Peugeot 3008 car seen in the Coneyburrow Road area of Lifford between 10:00 and 11:00 local time on 20 January to contact them, a Garda spokesperson said.

Headline: Can AI help modernise Ireland's healthcare system?
Author: Padraig Belton, Technology Reporter
Published Date: 2025-02-28T00:06:40.724Z
Text: For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.
They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.
In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.
Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.
But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.
That includes a programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its €22.9bn (£20bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.
To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.
It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.
That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.
"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans," says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.
Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.
To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: "We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures."
The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.
"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man," he says.
Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.
Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.
Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.
But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a "synthetic MRI" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.
That was done by feeding a "generative AI" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.
Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.
And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.
Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.
But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.
That will "severely delay" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.
Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.
"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road," says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.
"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do," he says.
Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.
An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.
But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.
To prevent such AI from hallucinating, "you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist," says Prof MacMahon.
AIs can have biases, but "humans have biases too", he points out.
A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.
"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error", than in new health technology where "the acceptable risk is zero", says Prof Seán Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.
This means we "continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.
Healthcare regulators, who already have a "weak enough" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.
For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.
But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. "For us, manufacturing literally means copying software," he points out.
AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.
That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.
When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to "be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected," he says.

Headline: Tate brothers arrive in US after Romania prosecutors lift travel ban

Text: British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate - who are facing trial in Romania on charges including human trafficking - have arrived in the US after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban.
Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The two departed Bucharest on a private jet early on Thursday and arrived in Florida hours later, with Andrew telling reporters they are "misunderstood".
Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against them had not been dropped and that they remain "under judicial control" - meaning they have to regularly report to authorities and are expected to return to Romania.
However their exit has sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.
The Tate brothers are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.
In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities.
The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny all the allegations against them.
Upon arrival, Andrew Tate told reporters: "We live in a democratic society where it's innocent until proven guilty and I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood."
"There's a lot of opinions about us, a lot of things that got around about us on the internet," he said, adding that they are "yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever".
The brothers declined to answer questions about their release and Trump's role in them being allowed into the US.
A lawyer for the Tate brothers, Joseph McBride, said they will return to Romania at the end of March to meet the prosecutor before returning to the US.
"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president. As a result, they are excited to call America their home again," Mr McBride said in a statement.
Speaking in the White House after their plane landed, Trump said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.
Asked if his administration pressured the Romanian government to release them, he said: "I know nothing about that. I don't know, you're saying he's on a plane right now?"
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was sitting next to Trump in the White House, said: "There's an English element here, so obviously it's important justice is done, and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk."
On Thursday, the brothers arrived at Fort Lauderdale in Florida around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) and were seen disembarking the aircraft.
Their arrival follows comments made by Trump administration figures earlier this month.
The Tates have regularly posted messages in support of Trump, and Tristan Tate has said his brother's role in persuading "millions of young men" to back him "cannot be overlooked".
Romania's Foreign Minister has also told Romanian TV that Trump's envoy for special missions had raised the brothers during a conversation at the Munich Security Conference in Germany a fortnight ago.
Emil Hurezeanu said his discussion with Richard Grenell had been informal and he did not consider the approach "a form of pressure". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident from his "publicly available tweets".
However, women who have brought sexual abuse allegations against the Tate brothers said last week they were "extremely concerned" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions for the men.
Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist who has attracted millions of followers online, despite being previously banned from social media platforms for expressing his views.
He and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking.
They both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny.
A former kickboxer who had appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew had moved from the UK to Romania several years ago. However police in Bedfordshire are still seeking his extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion.
In the UK, four British women have filed a civil case against Andrew Tate in the UK High Court, alleging that he raped and coercively controlled them. Tate denies all the allegations against him.
Those plaintiffs said it was clear he would not face criminal prosecution in Romania and appealed to UK authorities to take action.
"We are in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the US," the women said in a statement.
Elena Lasconi, who is running for the Romanian presidency in May's elections, six months after they were controversially cancelled, has called for the immediate resignation of the head of Romania's organised crime investigations directorate DIICOT, which made the decision to let the brothers leave.
"I am outraged!" she wrote on social media, "as a woman, a human being and a Romanian." Lasconi said prosecutors should explain publicly whether their decision had come as a result of external pressure.
Prosecutors from DIICOT have emphasised that the judicial conditions for the brothers have not changed.
Any violation of those obligations made in bad faith "may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher measure of deprivation of liberty", it said in a statement in Romanian.
Following a successful court appeal on Wednesday, the brothers also had multiple assets returned to them which had originally been seized by authorities - including six properties, six cars, and frozen bank accounts.
This comes after court limitations were "modified in order to allow the brothers to travel to the USA," the statement from the Tates' representative said.
The Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy the prosecutors' terms, however it is too early to say whether they will comply with them.
Romania is both a member of the European Union and a key Nato member state on the Western alliance's eastern flank. It has an extradition treaty with the US.
Senior Trump figures have also had the government in Bucharest in their sights over the court ruling that annulled last December's presidential election. Romanian intelligence services said far-right candidate Calin Georgescu had been supported by a flurry of TikTok accounts engineered by Russia.
Georgescu was indicted on Wednesday for attempted "incitement to acts against the constitutional order". He has denied any wrongdoing and has previously called the election annulment a "formalised coup d'etat". Prosecutors are still investigating the allegations of election fraud.

Text: A 40-year-old man has been found guilty of the murder of a mother-of two in her home in Ballymun in Dublin in May 2022.
Brian McHugh of Cairn Court, Poppintree in Ballymun, had pleaded not guilty to murdering Lisa Thompson, 52, at the house in Sandyhill Gardens, in Dublin.
She had been stabbed 11 times in the chest and strangled with a blind cord.
A forensic scientist told the Central Criminal Court trial that McHugh's DNA was found on the cord.
When asked about the presence of his DNA on the cord, McHugh told gardai that he had been "in and out" of Ms Thompson's house "for the last three years".
The trial also heard evidence that Ms Thompson had been dealing prescription drugs from her home and that she had been in a brief relationship with McHugh.
The prosecution argued that McHugh was seen on CCTV in the early hours of the morning of 9 May near Ms Thompson's house.
Defence counsel for McHugh submitted that this was not "the neat case wrapped up in a bow" which the prosecution had presented to the jury.
The 12 jurors took three hours and 24 minutes to unanimously reject McHugh's defence.
The judge, Ms Justice Karen O'Connor, offered her "sincere condolences" to the Thompson family and thanked them for their dignity throughout the case.
"I cannot imagine your pain and what you have suffered in terms of your grief," she said.
McHugh will be sentenced to the mandatory term of life in prison on 10 March.
On that date, the Thompson family will have an opportunity to make a statement to the court about the impact Lisa's death has had on their lives.

Headline: Dáil speaking rights protest branded 'childish'

Text: Irish opposition parties have been branded "childish" by the tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) after they announced protest action over a long-running row on speaking rights at the Irish parliament.
The issue, sparked in January when Ireland's newly-formed coalition government attempted to be formally elected, centres on independent members of the government getting dedicated time in parliament to hold ministers to account.
On Thursday, a Dáil (Irish parliament) reform committee voted to allow new speaking slots for those independent members who support the government.
However, opposition parties labelled the meeting as "disgraceful".
The parties - including Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and Independent Ireland - have announced they will withdraw from pairing arrangements in protest.
The speaking rights plan has to be voted through the Dáil before it can proceed but will have sufficient support thanks to the government majority.
Pairing is a process where a parliament member of a party abstains from a vote if the member of an opposition party cannot attend.
The withdrawal of pairing would negatively affect government business in March when most ministers travel abroad for St Patrick's Day engagements.
Almost 40 ministers, junior ministers and other state officials have trips organised to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand.
Tánaiste Simon Harris told the Dáil it has never been more important for ministers to travel abroad for discussions, but the withdrawal of pairings will now prevent this.
He also defended the government's speaking rights plan, arguing that all Dáil members should be allowed ask questions on behalf of their constituents.
But he faced pointed questions from opposition members about what kind of deal the government had done with independents in order to secure their support.
The government is seeking to push through a plan to introduce extra speaking time slots in the Dáil for independents who want to question the country's leaders.
Some of those independents supported and even helped to negotiate the current programme for government.
However, they now want dedicated Dáil time to hold ministers to account, something that opposition parties argue would undermine democracy.
The row has been rumbling since January, when loud protests from opposition parties led to turbulent scenes in the Dáil, which had to be repeatedly adjourned.
The protests resulted in a one-day delay to the re-election of Micheál Martin as taoiseach (Irish prime minister).
In early February, the Ceann Comhairle (parliament speaker) ruled the initial plan - which would have seen those independents treated as part of the opposition for the purposes of speaking time - could not proceed.
On Wednesday, the Dáil Reform Committee voted to approve a plan that would see the creation of new question time slots for independent members.
Irish national broadcaster RTÉ reported that the government defended the plan in a two-page document circulated to the Dáil Reform Committee, which started a "modern parliament is not necessarily made up of 'government' and 'opposition' members".
It added "there are members who can't readily be categorised as such," referring to independents who support the government but do not have ministerial posts.
It has also said the plan would mean independents have their own speaking time that would not take away from opposition speaking time rights.
If voted through, the plan would mean about 60 Dáil members would be allowed to question the taoiseach and the tánaiste on a weekly basis.
Harris argued on Thursday that all TDs (Irish parliament members) should be allowed to ask questions on behalf of their constituents and he vowed to defend that right.
However opposition parties have been highly critical - in a joint statement they said it was "another cynical attempt to manipulate speaking time in order to grant special privileges to TDs who were part of negotiating the programme for government and clearly and unambiguously support the government".
Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy said the government was plunging the Dáil into chaos while Labour TD Duncan Smith said the government were "defending the indefensible".
Martin's Fianna Fáil party won the most seats in November's general election but not enough to form a government on their own.
It entered a coalition with Fine Gael and several independents to gain a majority, but some of those independents sought to form a "technical group" that would have seen them afforded speaking time and other rights from the opposition benches.

Text: Jurors in the trial of two people accused of the murder of 66-year-old Robert Wilkin have been warned it could be dangerous to act on some of the testimony of one of the co-accused.
Alan Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal, and Nikita Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both deny the murder of Robert Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, on 25 June 2023.
The body of the County Tyrone man was found in the sea at the foot of Slieve League cliffs in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland.
On Thursday, Mr Justice Paul McDermott urged the jury to "proceed with caution" in respect of Mr Vial's evidence "in respect of his implication of Ms Burns."
During the trial Mr Vial claimed it was his former lover and co-accused Ms Burns who beat Mr Wilkin to death with a rock and helped put his body over Ireland's tallest cliffs.
He insisted he was telling the truth when he said that Ms Burns caused Mr Wilkin's death by twice striking him on the back of the head with a rock and that he did not strike him at all.
It is the prosecution case that Mr Vial and Ms Burns were part of a joint enterprise to cause serious harm to Mr Wilkin before putting him over the cliffs.
In a statement to Gardai ( Irish police), Ms Burns denied striking Mr Wilkin and described a fight in which her co-accused hit the deceased six or seven times with a rock.
She also denied helping to put the body over the cliff but accepted that she had helped to clean Mr Wilkin's blood from the car.
Mr Justice McDermott told the jury at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin that Ms Burns' statements to Gardai or others outside court cannot be used as evidence against Mr Vial.
However, Mr Vial's court testimony, which was subject to cross examination by Ms Burns' lawyers, can be used as evidence against her.
The judge added: "You have to proceed with caution when considering his evidence in respect of his implication of Ms Burns, because there is a danger that a co-accused, in his position, on the same charge of murder, may fabricate evidence or falsely implicate their co-accused."
While the jury can rely on Mr Vial's testimony if they accept it, Mr Justice McDermott said it is "dangerous to act on it" where it is uncorroborated by other evidence.
"You are not precluded from acting on it," he said, "but you must bear in mind the warning I have given you in respect of doing so."
Jurors were told where the prosecution alleges a joint enterprise murder, it must prove that both accused entered a tacit or explicit agreement to kill or cause serious injury to Mr Wilkin.
If they both acted in pursuit of that joint goal, the prosecution does not have to establish which of the two inflicted the fatal blows.
However, if the prosecution has failed to prove the joint enterprise beyond a reasonable doubt, jurors were told, they must consider each accused's individual responsibility.
In particular, they must consider whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt whether either accused killed Mr Wilkin with the necessary intent for murder.
The judge further told the jury that in relation to each accused, they can return a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of impeding the apprehension of another person for murder.
That would arise, he said, in a situation where they were satisfied that one of the accused is guilty of murder but the case against the other is unproven.
Mr Justice McDermott has begun a reprise of the evidence heard during the trial, which began on 17 January. The jury is not available on Friday or Monday and will return next Tuesday.

Text: The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin has told the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that Ireland is committed to helping his country financially.
They met at Shannon Airport in County Clare on Thursday. Martin cancelled a planned visit to Stormont in order to attend the meeting.
He told Zelensky that he has to look at "alternative approaches to give financial aid to Ukraine".
"Our commitments... have been frustrated by Hungary's decision to veto the deployment of the European peace facility fund set up by the European union," he explained.
Zelensky is due to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources.
He made a brief stop at the Irish airport on the way to this meeting.
"We discussed issues around a sustainable and durable peace settlement," Martin said.
"We made it clear that we would push very strongly for an accelerated timeline in terms of Ukrainian membership of the European Union," he said.
He said Zelensky "was very thankful... for Ireland's sustained support for the Ukrainian people... as they battle through this terrible war".
He said Ireland could help by taking part in initiatives to help feed children in Ukraine and is looking into supporting financially the use of robotic drones to help bring back soldiers who are injured.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Zelensky said he was delighted to be in Ireland and to meet with the Taoiseach.
He thanked the Irish people for the support they have offered Ukrainian citizens who have been forced to flee from conflict.
At the end of 2024 almost 80,000 Ukrainian refugees were still living in the Republic of Ireland, according to Ireland's Central Statistics Office.
Earlier this week, Ireland pledged to increase financial humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
Martin said that Ireland would "contribute more financially on all fronts and in all areas".

Text: Five months after the far-right Freedom Party won Austria's general election, a three-way coalition looks set to exclude it from power.
The conservative People's Party (ÖVP), the Social Democrats (SPÖ), and the liberal Neos say they have successfully completed negotiations to form a new administration - a record 151 days since the election was held in September.
The leader of the Eurosceptic, Russia-friendly Freedom Party (FPÖ), Herbert Kickl, called the tie-up a coalition of "losers" and called for a snap election.
Thursday's announcement follows the longest period of coalition negotiations in Austria's recent history, after two previous attempts to form a government failed.
The three-party government, which would be the first since the late 1940s, is due to take office next week, if all the parties approve the deal. The biggest hurdle is a vote at a Neos party meeting on Sunday, where a two-thirds majority is needed.
The new chancellor will be Christian Stocker of the ÖVP.
As he presented the new government programme with the leader of the SPÖ, Andreas Babler, and the Neos, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Stocker said the negotiations had been "perhaps the most difficult in the history of our country".
But he said they had achieved "a breakthrough" that wasn't "a minimal compromise".
The three parties set out plans to avoid facing a European Union procedure for running an excess budget deficit, with measures including an increased levy on banks.
The programme also includes tougher asylum measures, including a temporary stop for family reunifications.
Stocker said there would be "an integration year for refugees" from day one of their arrival in Austria.
The three parties also said they reserved the right to impose an asylum freeze, if numbers of applications increased. They are also planning a headscarf ban for girls under 15.
The programme also emphasised that the government was "committed to a strong and better European Union".
In a post on social media, Kickl said: "I don't think this has ever happened before: a so-called 'government programme' before a government has even been formed."
Despite the FPÖ's unprecedented victory, topping the polls for the first time, Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen first gave the ÖVP the mandate to form a government.
At the time, the leaders of all of the other parties ruled out making an alliance with Herbert Kickl.
However, the ÖVP's first attempt to forge a coalition with the Social Democrats and Neos failed at the beginning of January.
On 6 January, Van der Bellen gave Kickl the mandate to form a government.
But a few weeks later, the Freedom Party's talks with the conservatives also broke down, partly due to disputes over minister posts.
Political analyst Thomas Hofer told the BBC that there had been "no base of trust" between the two parties.
The ÖVP, the Social Democrats and Neos then started a second round of negotiations, which culminated in an agreement.
Thomas Hofer says their new alliance faces challenges.
"This is of course an emergency cabinet. It had to be built quickly and one can see that looking at the programme, The main message is that they are not Herbert Kickl, but that message will not last very long. They will have to negotiate more along the way."
Hofer says the parties "even have to guarantee inner party stability", and that their popularity could grow if they tackle "the massive problems ahead, but those problems are also a chance for the FPÖ", which he said had flourished in opposition.
According to opinion polls, a new election would see further gains for the Freedom Party.

Text: A search at a house in Drogheda, County Louth, as part of the investigation into the murder of a six-year-old boy who disappeared more than two years ago, has entered a second day.
Kyran Durnin was reported missing at the end of last summer but gardaí (Irish police) believe he may have been killed more than two years earlier.
They began a murder investigation in October, saying they were treating Kyran as missing, presumed dead.
That same month they carried out a dig at his former family home in Emer Terrace, Dundalk, but there was no sign of his body.
On Wednesday, a white cordon was erected around a house on Hand Street in Drogheda.
Officers from the Garda Technical Bureau undertook a forensic examination of the property, including the rear garden.
A mini-digger was used to excavate land.
Kyran had been a pupil at the national [primary] school near his home in Dundalk until the summer of 2022.
He did not return to class after the summer holidays and it is understood authorities were told he was moving to Northern Ireland and to a new school in Newry.
Tusla, the Irish state agency responsible for child welfare and protection, said it received no referrals or concern about Kyran's attendance or educational welfare between 2022 and 2024.
In December, two houses were searched in Drogheda. One of the searches involved the use of a cadaver dog.
The results of the searches were not made public.
The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris previously said he had never seen a case like this in his 40-year career in policing on both sides of the border.

Headline: 'In a scary world, he gives us hope': Faithful gather to support the Pope

Text: Catholics gathered to pray for the health of the Pope beneath the steps of St Peter's Basilica for a third night, as his doctors said his condition showed further slight improvement.
Nuns dangling rosary beads, tourists and student priests were among those who joined the gentle incantation of the rosary in the Vatican.
They were led by a cardinal in a scarlet skull cap who prayed for Pope Francis to be able to resume his duties as soon as possible.
The nightly gatherings began on Monday after the 88-year-old's health took a dramatic dip at the weekend. He was fighting to breathe and needed blood transfusions.
But the latest statements suggest the Pope is able to sit in his chair, is eating normally and even doing what the Vatican calls "light work": reading and signing documents.
"It was a bit scary last weekend but a bit better now," Stacey, a medical student from Paris, told the BBC.
She was attending the prayers for the Pope for a second time.
"Francis is very popular with young people because he's really open, and in a world that became a little scary, he gives us a lot of hope."
Xiomara, from Panama, said she felt drawn to this Pope in particular as he was "a good man".
"Prayers always help, they don't just hang in the air," she believes.
Leading the rosary from beneath a white canopy was Cardinal Battista Re.
He's the figure in the Vatican who would call a conclave - the closed gathering of senior clergy that elects a Pope - if Francis were not able to continue in the role.
Despite the slight improvement, the Pope's medical team are still giving no prognosis.
He was admitted to Gemelli hospital on 14 February with double-pneumonia and, according to the Vatican, a CT scan of his lungs shows a "normal evolution" which suggests he is responding to treatment.
We're told he still uses additional oxygen but has suffered no further "respiratory crises".
The tone of Vatican officials has certainly relaxed a little.
On Tuesday, the Pope's condition was described as "stable", which was new. By Wednesday evening there was a "further slight improvement" and the update omitted to say "critical" for the first time.
Vatican officials cautioned that didn't mean the Pope was out of the woods.
But with so little to go on, those following his condition closely are wringing every word - or missing word - for meaning.
Inevitably, many have also been wondering about the future.
The Pope was frail even before this infection, so there has been speculation over whether he might resign.
The Quotidiano Nazionale newspaper calls it the "fluttering of crows" over St Peter's, inevitable at the "sunset" of any Papacy.
It's even louder this time since Benedict XVI set a precedent and stepped down in 2013, the first Pope to do so in six centuries.
Francis has said before that he would consider resigning if he can't carry out his duties.
"His instinct will be to carry on as long as he can and is able to," believes Austen Ivereigh, who co-authored a book with Pope Francis.
"He's shown he doesn't mind being a weak and frail Pope; he can be a Pope in a wheelchair, or one who gets ill regularly and that's ok."
All the same, if his health prognosis were too bad, the author said, "then the [resignation] issue might arise."
Even with Francis confined to the Gemelli hospital, the well-oiled Vatican cogs continue to turn. The bureaucracy functions and the Pope has been signing some documents.
On Monday, his secretary of state and another senior official visited.
Officially, the Pope signed papers, moving a list of candidates further along the path towards sainthood.
But some question why they couldn't wait, given the frailty of the Pope, and wonder what other plans were discussed at that meeting.
As Francis enters his 14th day in hospital, pilgrims to Rome are already experiencing life without him. His weekly audience, or meeting, with the faithful was cancelled for the second week.
"We really want him to get better and continue the amazing work he's started," said Mabi.
She mentions the foregrounding of women in the church in particular.
"He's a people's Pope and people want his work to continue."
"We're sorry, because we hoped to meet the Pope today at an audience – we had tickets," Fr Cristiano said.
Around him almost 100 Catholics from northern Italy were gathering to begin processing up the street towards St Peter's behind a large wooden crucifix.
"I'm not disappointed, I'm just worried for him," the priest said. "Today the news is not so bad, but it's not so good, either. So we need to pray."

Headline: Leaked recordings challenge Greek account of deadly shipwreck

Text: Leaked audio instructions by Greek rescue co-ordinators have cast further doubt on Greece's official version of events in the hours before a migrant boat sank along with up to 650 people onboard.
The Adriana went down in the early hours of 14 June 2023 in international waters – but within Greece's rescue zone - after leaving Libya days earlier.
Survivors later told the BBC that coastguards had caused their overcrowded fishing boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent.
The Greek coastguard denied these claims and maintains it did not try to rescue those onboard because they were not in danger and said they had voluntarily wanted to reach Italy, not Greece.
But in a phone call that's now emerged an unnamed man speaking from inside a Greek rescue coordination centre is heard instructing the captain of the migrant boat to tell an approaching ship that those onboard do not want to reach Greece.
The coastguard has not commented on the audio but said it had handed over all available evidence to a Naval Court which is investigating the disaster.
The sinking was one of the worst-ever disasters known to have happened in the Mediterranean Sea.
It is estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off from the port of Tobruk in Libya nearly a week earlier.
Eighty-two bodies were recovered, but the United Nations believes an additional 500 people - including 100 women and children who were in the hold of the boat - may have died.
Audio recordings obtained by Greek website News247.gr reveal phone calls involving the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) at the port of Piraeus, near the capital Athens.
In the first call, at 18:50 local time (15:50 GMT) on 13 June, an officer is heard explaining to the man piloting the migrant boat that a large red vessel will soon be approaching to give supplies and that he should explain that the migrants do not want to reach Greece.
Officer 1:
The replies of the man captaining the migrant boat are not heard.
In a second call, 90 minutes later, at 22:10, a seemingly different officer from the same coordination centre, speaks to the captain of the Lucky Sailor (the "big red ship").
Officer 2: OK, captain, sorry before I couldn't hear you. I couldn't understand what did you say to me. You told me you gave them food, water and they told you that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy, they don't want anything else?
Lucky Sailor captain: Yes because I asked them by megaphone "Greece or Italia?" and everybody there screaming Italia.
Officer 2: Aah, OK, OK everybody screaming that they don't want Greece and they want Italy?
Lucky Sailor captain: Yes, yes, yes.
Officer 2: OK
Lucky Sailor captain: They are all like crowded people, very crowded, full deck.
Officer 2: OK, captain. So you have finished with the supplies?
Lucky Sailor captain: Yes, sir, yes.
Officer 2: Captain, I want this, I want this to write it in your logbook. The bridge logbook.
Lucky Sailor captain: Yes OK, we will write it.
Officer 2: OK?
Lucky Sailor captain: Yes
Officer 2: I want you to write it about that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy. They want nothing from Greece and they want to go to Italy.
Lucky Sailor captain: OK, yes, yes.
Another vessel, the Faithful Warrior, also gave some supplies to the migrant boat but no further conversations between its captain and the Greek authorities have emerged.
The Greek coastguard did not comment on the contents of the conversations but told the BBC it had submitted "all the material it had in its possession, including the audio recordings and the diaries of events" to the Maritime Court Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating.
It said it had rescued more than a quarter of a million migrants in danger at sea in the last decade and arrested more than a thousand smugglers, and that its humanitarian work had been recognised internationally.
Our BBC investigation in the immediate days after the sinking challenged the Greek authorities' explanation for the disaster.
Analysis of the movement of other ships in the area suggests the overcrowded fishing vessel was not moving for at least seven hours before it capsized.
The coastguard has always insisted that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue.
Last year, a Greek court threw out charges against nine Egyptian men who were accused of causing the shipwreck.
The judges in the southern port city of Kalamata ruled they did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, on the grounds the vessel sank in international waters.
Listen: Surviving Greece's migrant boat disaster
The indictment had showed that the defendants were being prosecuted on evidence that had already been contradicted by at least six survivors, who told the BBC the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians.
Human rights lawyer, Dimitris Choulis, who represented some of the accused Egyptians said he was not surprised by what these recordings.
"We know about the coastguard's tactics of either pushing back or not rescuing people."
He claimed there had been "an attempted cover up from day one."
"They [Greek authorities] told the story 'they did not want to be rescued' and so have insulted the memory of so many dead people," he told the BBC.
Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and have called for an international investigation.
The Greek Ombudsman - an independent authority removed from the government - has been looking at the allegations.
The disaster is also being examined by the Greek Naval Court.

A mini-digger was used to excavate land.
The search has been stood down for the night and is set to resume at first light on Thursday.
Kyran was originally reported missing alongside his mother, Dayla Durnin, in August 2024.
One of Kyran's grandmothers claimed she had last seen them in her home in Drogheda and, at that time, she appealed for her daughter Dayla to contact her.
Dayla was later found alive in Great Britain without Kyran.
Gardaí investigating the schoolboy's disappearance have made two arrests during the course of their inquiry so far.
A man and a woman were arrested two days apart in mid-December but they were both released without charge within a day of being detained.
The man, who was arrested on suspicion of Kyran's murder, was found dead at his home in Drogheda just days after his release from custody.
He was named locally as 36-year-old Anthony Maguire.
Confirming the latest search at a "domestic residence" in Drogheda, gardaí said they were "aware of ongoing extensive public commentary" on their investigation.
They warned that most of the speculation, rumours and theories on what may have happened to Kyran was "inaccurate and misinformed".
"Such ill-informed public commentary is not only disruptive to the Garda investigations but also adds to the trauma experienced by victims families," they added.
Kyran had been a pupil at the national [primary] school near his home in Dundalk until the summer of 2022.

2021-2022 - Kyran attends a national [primary] school near his home in Dundalk, but does not return to the school after the 2022 summer holidays.
May 2024 - Kyran's family move out of their home in Emer Terrace in Dundalk, where they had been living for a number of years.
Unknown date in August 2024 - Tusla, the Irish state agency responsible for child protection, alerts gardaí about "a significant concern about Kyran".
30 August 2024 - Kyran and his 24-year-old mother Dayla Durnin are reported missing from their home in Drogheda.
4 September 2024 - Gardaí issue a public missing persons appeal, seeking help to find Dayla and Kyran.
16 October 2024 - Gardaí say they now believe that "Kyran is missing, presumed dead" and they confirm they have begun a murder inquiry.
22 October 2024 - Kyran's former family home and garden in Emer Terrace, Dundalk, is searched by forensic investigators, as well as nearby open ground.
24 October 2024 - the Dundalk search ends, with gardaí adding that the results of the search are not being released for operational purposes.
31 October 2024 - Tusla declines to publicly release its review of its interactions with Kyran's family, adding information it held on him was lost in a cyber attack.
10 December 2024 - A woman is arrested by gardaí investigating Kyran's disappearance and murder but is released without charge the following day.
12 December 2024 - Two houses in Drogheda are searched and a man is arrested on suspicion of Kyran's murder, but he too is released without charge the next day.

Headline: Bosnian-Serb leader sentenced to jail in landmark trial

Text: A one-year prison sentence and a six-year ban on holding public office might seem like a heavy penalty for a politician.
But the Bosnian-Serb leader Milorad Dodik made light of the verdict at the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The president of the country's majority-Serb Republika Srpska region told supporters at a rally in the regional capital Banja Luka there was "no reason to worry".
His conviction on charges of ignoring the rulings of the international High Representative was "nonsense", he said.
Dodik said he had "learned to deal with more difficult things" and called on the crowd in Republika Srpska's de facto capital to "be cheerful".
The verdict was the culmination of a long-running conflict between Dodik and the international High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt.
Schmidt is still the supreme authority in Bosnia, 30 years on from the Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnian War of the 1990s.
The high representative has the power to impose or annul laws – and sack officials ranging from judges to political leaders.
One former holder of the post, Paddy Ashdown, the former leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, sacked almost 60 Bosnian-Serb officials in a single day in 2004, in a crackdown on their protection of war criminals.
But the high representative's powers have been used much more sparingly in subsequent years, as Bosnia's international supporters stepped back in the hope that local leaders would work together to create a viable and prosperous country.
The strategy has not been a success. Ethno-nationalist leaders remain entrenched in a country which is divided into two "entities" – the majority-Serb Republika Srpska and the Federation, where the population are mostly Bosniaks and Croats.
The central government is weak – and there is little incentive for parties to cooperate. Instead, their guiding philosophy is simple and self-interested: divide, rule and profit.
As a result, the country is struggling with low wages, a sluggish economy and a constant flow of emigration by talented people seeking a better future elsewhere.
"Bosnians of all ethnicities are united by their disdain for their own leaders," says Toby Vogel, co-founder of the Democratisation Policy Council think tank.
"They would love not to vote for these guys, but it's structurally almost impossible for cross-community politicians and parties to emerge."
Instead, leaders like Dodik get elected, time after time. The leader of the SNSD party has previously served as the Serb representative of the three-person national presidency and first became prime minister of Republika Srpska in 1998.
A constant theme of his leadership has been the threat to trigger the secession of the majority-Serb region.
Dodik and his government have consistently worked to undermine Bosnia's national institutions, introducing a series of laws to withdraw Republika Srpska from the armed forces, judiciary and tax system.
Such efforts eventually pushed the high representative to take action and annul the secessionist legislation.
Christian Schmidt warned that a renewal of conflict was possible, but insisted that he would "not sit still while others seek to dismantle [decades] of peace, stability and progress".
Dodik apparently viewed that as a challenge. He approved a law declaring that Republika Srpska would no longer recognise Schmidt's rulings. The high representative had already annulled the legislation – and made it a criminal offence to contradict his decisions.
That led to the prosecution of the Bosnian-Serb leader – with prosecutors calling for a maximum five-year prison sentence and 10-year ban from holding elected office. Dodik warned he would take "radical measures" if found guilty.
His conviction has not brought any fireworks so far. At this point, Dodik is insisting that he will not appeal. Instead, Republika Srpska's government is once again proposing legislation to withdraw from national institutions – including the court which passed the guilty verdict.
But Dodik is facing problems beyond Bosnia's borders. The US and UK have imposed sanctions on him and his family for corruption - threatening the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina - and connections with Russia.
Toby Vogel believes that is more likely to threaten the Bosnian-Serb leader than the court conviction.
"The conflict with the high representative will intensify," he says. "But Dodik might well be running out of road."
"He is running out of cash to pay his bloated administration… and he can no longer raise money on international markets. So, he is in very deep trouble indeed."
None of this will be much comfort to the long-suffering people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are still enduring the interminable wait for the prosperity promised by ethno-nationalists like Dodik. This latest court battle shows how distant that prospect remains.

Text: A British man has died and another was left injured while climbing in Norway.
Norwegian media reported an avalanche fell while the men scaled a frozen waterfall at Gaustatoppen mountain on Friday.
Rescuers reportedly failed to recover the man who died for several days due to poor weather conditions.
The Foreign Office said: "We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Norway, and a British man who has been injured, and are in contact with the local authorities."
An avalanche fell on the mountain in Norway's southern Telemark county early on Friday afternoon, Norwegian media reported.
Rescuers were said to have airlifted one of the climbers to hospital with non-fatal injuries on Saturday.
Efforts to recover the second man were postponed several times due to bad weather, Norway's NRK reported.
"Prevailing weather conditions, avalanche danger and accessibility made it a very complicated and demanding task to get in and down to the climbers," local emergency manager Tor Einar Bakken told the broadcaster.
Fire and police officers reportedly recovered his body on Tuesday morning using ropes and by abseiling, as poor conditions meant it was not possible to use a helicopter.

Text: Far-right populist Calin Georgescu, who came from nowhere to win the first round of last year's presidential election, has been detained by police and is facing criminal proceedings on a series of charges.
Georgescu was stopped in traffic in the capital, Bucharest, on his way to register as a candidate for new elections in May, after last December's second-round run-off was annulled by the constitutional court.
Prosecutors said one of the charges involved attempted "incitement to actions against the constitutional order".
Two right-wing populist parties said they were mobilising their supporters to head for the prosecutor's office, where Georgescu was taken for questioning.
Police were seen erecting barriers around the building and hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest.
Prosecutors said Georgescu was also being investigated for giving "false information, false statements" and for setting up an organisation with "fascist, racist or xenophobic characteristics" as well as forming an antisemitic organisation.
The severity of the indictment could jeopardise Georgescu's bid to run in the presidential election on 4 and 18 May.
He has been placed under judicial control and told not to leave Romania, according to reports. As he left the prosecutor's office, Georgescu told supporters he would continue to fight and that there was "no difference between the communist mentality and system [that collapsed in 1989] and now".
The original presidential vote was cancelled before the second round last December, after the then president, Klaus Iohannis declassified intelligence documents that suggested that hundreds of TikTok accounts had been activated backing Georgescu.
Romanian foreign intelligence said Russia had been behind the move, as well as thousands of cyber-attacks and other sabotage.
Iohannis had decided to stay in office until a successor was elected, but he resigned earlier this month ahead of an impeachment vote.
Opposition politicians had at the time accused Iohannis of an undemocratic move, and Georgescu's communications team repeated the claim against prosecutors.
"Where is democracy now?" they posted on X on Wednesday, tagging President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and US Vice-President JD Vance.
Earlier this month, the US vice-president accused Romania of annulling the elections based on "flimsy suspicions" of Romanian intelligence and pressure from its neighbours.
Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu accused Elon Musk of a "form of interference" in Romania's elections, after the billionaire posted several messages of support for Georgescu.
Georgescu's hopes of running for the presidency may end up at the constitutional court, which barred another far-right, pro-Russian candidate from running last year.
The decision to turn down Diana Sosoaca's candidacy because of her views was widely criticised in Romania.
Romania is a vital part of Nato's eastern flank as well as being a member of the European Union.
Calin Georgescu has been accused of being pro-Russian and he has praised Romania's fascist and nationalist leaders from the last century as heroes.
He denied he was "Moscow's man", in a BBC interview last year, but referred to Vladimir Putin as a "patriot and a leader" while pointing out "I am not a fan".
Meanwhile, Romanian police said they had carried out raids in several counties around the country, targeting 27 individuals as part of a criminal case relating to the creation of an organisation "with a fascist, racist or xenophobic nature".
Investigations were also being conducted into false statements regarding the sources of election campaign funding, police said.
The statement made no mention of Georgescu himself and it was not clear if the raids were linked, however he said he was fighting a security system "that wants us in slavery".

Text: Gardaí (Irish police) have released without charge a man who was arrested in connection with the death of a woman on board a ferry sailing from Wales to Ireland.
The incident occurred on Tuesday, on the 14:00 GMT Stena Line sailing from Fishguard to Rosslare in County Wexford.
Gardaí and emergency services attended the scene after being alerted to what police described as "an unexplained death" shortly after 17:00 local time. They then boarded the ship.
The woman was later pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination has been completed but the results "are not being released for operational reasons", gardai said.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that the ship's captain made an emergency call about half an hour before the ship docked.
On Tuesday evening, the 19:00 outbound Stena sailing from Rosslare to Fishguard was cancelled with passengers being accommodated by Irish ferries on the 20:45 sailing from Rosslare to Pembroke, according to the company.
Wexford councillor Ger Carthy said locals reacted with "shock and sadness" at the "tragic events".
"What transpired here last night and the response that was given by the gardaí and the state agencies was second to none," he added.
In a statement, Stenaline said: "We can confirm that An Garda Síochána is investigating an incident that occurred on the 14:00 ferry crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on Tuesday February 25.
"In order to assist with the Garda investigation, last night's 19:30 and 01:30 Stena Nordica sailings were cancelled. Today's 08:30 sailing from Rosslare and return from Fishguard at 14:00 have also been cancelled."
The ship departed for its journey to Fishguard from Rosslare at 19:30 local time on Wednesday.

Text: The award-winning Irish novelist and playwright Jennifer Johnston, known for her novel How Many Miles to Babylon?, has died aged 95.
The celebrated author, who wrote dozens of novels and plays, was born in Dublin in 1930 and in the 1970s moved to Londonderry, which became her home for much of her adult life.
A child of the playwright Denis Johnston and actor and producer Shelah Richards, her first novel, The Captains and the Kings, was published in 1972 and How Many Miles to Babylon? two years later.
In 2012, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Irish Book Awards and was one of the writers nominated in 2014 for the position of first Irish Laureate for Fiction.
Ms Johnston had been diagnosed with dementia and died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin.
The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, led tributes to the author.
"Throughout her many novels and plays, Jennifer Johnston provided a deep and meaningful examination of the nature and limitations of identity, family and personal connections throughout the tumultuous events of 20th Century Irish life," he said.
"It is noteworthy that her work has always been championed by so many of her fellow writers, who have acknowledged her as one of the finest of Irish novelists.
"So many of them have recorded her as a strong influence on so much of their own work."
Ms Johnston was a much loved and celebrated figure in Irish literature, known for exploring themes like Anglo-Irish identity and the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
How Many Miles to Babylon?, the story of an unlikely friendship between two boys from very different social backgrounds during World War One, remains a set text for English literature students.
Her novel Shadows on Our Skin was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1977.
The book, which was set in Derry in the 1970s, followed Joe Logan navigating teenage life against a backdrop of bombs and bullets.
The Irish government's minister for arts and culture, Patrick O'Donovan, said Ms Johnston was "one of Ireland's most celebrated authors", adding she "has been rightly acclaimed among the best novelists in the world".
Chair of the Arts Council in Ireland Maura McGrath said she was "an esteemed literary voice whose work captured the complexities of Irish life with extraordinary depth and sensitivity".
She said Ms Johnston's body of work "resonated across generations, and her contribution to Irish literature will endure".
Irish broadcaster Miriam O'Callaghan said she had been a "remarkable talent" and a "trailblazer for women".
Ms Johnston's friend, Mary Murphy, described her as a "formidable force" with "a wicked sense of humour".
"She was a brilliant conversationalist, an evening spent with Jennifer would have you going from being stimulated intellectually and philosophically one minute, and the next, you would be bent over laughing," Ms Murphy told BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show.
Ms Murphy said Ms Johnston never did anything half-hearted and put her heart and soul into everything she did, adding that her body of fantastic work is testament to that.
She also described her deep love for the city of Derry and its people, saying she was very happy to call the place her home for so long.
"She became very quickly part of the intellectual life of the city," Ms Murphy said.
"Jennifer loved it here, she was thoroughly involved here."
Mary Murphy added that she would remember her as a dear friend and, above all else, a truly fantastic writer whose work will stand the test of time.

Headline: What is Nato, why isn't Ukraine a member and is defence spending increasing?
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-02-26T11:25:15.000Z
Text: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.
Nato currently asks member states to spend at least 2% on defence - but US President Donald Trump has called on European countries to spend much more than that target.
Trump has been dealing directly with Russia to try to broker a peace deal in Ukraine, calling into question America's support for the Nato alliance.
Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US.
Nato's primary purpose
, external
was to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia.
Members agree that if one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.
, external
Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises.
For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004.
It also co-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.
, external
Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949.
After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.
Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024.
Having been neutral for decades, both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join.
Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.
However, in 2008, the alliance said that Ukraine could eventually join
, external
.
After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked.
Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine could join "in the long term" but not until after the war ended.
However, speaking at a defence summit in Brussels in February, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said "the US does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement".
Some Nato defence chiefs pushed back against the comments.
German defence minister Boris Pistorius said "he regretted" the decision to rule out Ukraine joining Nato without a wider discussion. Sweden's defence minister Pal Jonson insisted membership was "not off the table".
Zelensky later said he was prepared to "give up" his presidency if it meant Ukraine could join Nato.
"If to achieve peace you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready," he told reporters.
"I can trade it for Nato membership, if there are such conditions."
The Trump administration's decision to align itself with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine has cast doubt on America's long-term commitment to both European security and Nato itself.
In votes at the United Nations in New York, to mark the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, the US twice sided with Russia instead of its Nato colleagues.
European leaders are having to react quickly to a changing security situation.
Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his "absolute priority" in office would be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible "so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA".
Nato leaders are due to meet in June but Merz questioned whether that summit would involve Nato in its current form "or whether we will have to establish an independent European defence capability".
Hegseth sets out hard line on European defence and Nato
Trump calls Zelensky a 'dictator' as rift between two leaders deepens
Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence?
In January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income - or GDP - on defence
, external
, telling reporters: "They can all afford it."
Hegseth echoed this call, saying the US would no longer "tolerate an imbalanced relationship" with its allies.
Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending.
It is thought that 23 countries met the 2% target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014.
The countries which have traditionally spent the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states.
Sir Keir - who is due to meet Trump in Washington at the end of February - has said the UK will increase its defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027.
This would mean an extra £13.4bn of defence spending every year from 2027, he told House of Commons.
The rise would be funded by cutting the UK's aid budget from 0.5% of GDP to 0.3%, Sir Keir said.
Before the general election, Labour had promised to raise development spending by the same amount.

Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?
Nato previously described Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the "most significant and direct threat to allies' security".

The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia.
However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment.
German research organisation the Kiel Institute
, external
said that under former President Joe Biden, the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024.
European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (£43.7bn) over the same period.
The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones.
The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp.
In August 2024, Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets - the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states.
Since November 2024, the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory.
Hegseth has suggested the US will significantly scale back its support for Ukraine, and that European nations will have to provide the majority of military aid.
UK Defence Secretary John Healey said the UK had "heard a clear message from the US about stepping up and we are". He highlighted a new £150m package which includes drones, tanks and air defence systems.

A man has been arrested in connection with the investigation and is currently detained.
Stena Line has confirmed that an incident occurred this afternoon on the 14:00 sailing from Fishguard in Wales to Rosslare, County Wexford.
Gardaí and emergency services were alerted to the incident shortly after 17:00 local time and embarked the ship which is currently docked at Rosslare Harbour.
A woman was later pronounced dead and her body remains at the scene.
A large force of gardaí, including armed officers, and other emergency services are at the scene.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that the ship's captain made an emergency call around half an hour before the ship docked.
The scene has been preserved for technical and forensic examination.
The Office of the State Pathologist and local coroner have been made aware of the incident. A post-mortem examination will be carried out and gardaí said the outcome will determine the course of the investigation.
The 19:00 local time outbound Stena sailing from Rosslare to Fishguard was cancelled.
Passengers are being accommodated by Irish ferries on the 20:45 sailing from Rosslare to Pembroke, according to the company.
RTÉ reported that all passengers and crew on the ship will be interviewed as part of the investigation.

Headline: German politics froze out the far right for years – is this about to change?
Author: Paul Kirby & Kristina Volk, BBC News in Berlin
Published Date: 2025-02-25T13:08:08.773Z
Text: One in five German voters put an X in the box for Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday: a record result that has made them the second biggest force in German politics.
Riding on the back of that success, the party is now calling for an end to the consensus in German politics not to work with the far right.
That "firewall" - Brandmauer in German - has worked since the end of World War Two, but AfD joint leader Tino Chrupalla says: "Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them."
There is a determination among all of Germany's main parties to keep that block in place - and the German public backs them up: 69% see the AfD as a threat to democracy, according to voters surveyed on Sunday.
Friedrich Merz, who won the election for the conservatives, believes the only reason the AfD exists is because of problems such as migration and security that need to be addressed: "We need to resolve these problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear."
The AfD won 20.8% of the vote nationally, and as the light blue areas of the map show, it was dominant in the five states in the east, securing 34%.
"East Germans have made it very clear they no longer want a firewall," said Tino Chrupalla.
Friedrich Merz will now go into talks on forming a government with the Social Democrats, who came third.
Even though his party won 28.6% of the vote, it was still their second-worst result since World War Two.
Support for the AfD doubled, and a million of their voters deserted Merz's conservatives for them, according to a survey by research institute Infratest dimap.
Voters have not been put off by the fact that Germany's domestic intelligence classifies parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist - or that the party has now embraced a policy called "remigration".
The AfD argues that remigration means deporting immigrants convicted of crime, but the term has been used by the extreme right to mean mass deportations.
One of the big issues for the Christian Democrats is how to get their voters back and stop losing more.
Merz has already flirted with the AfD in parliament, relying on their votes to push through a motion on migration.
But he was clearly stung by a public outcry and the mass protests that followed in many German cities.
Germany's chancellor-in-waiting is unlikely to try that again, especially if he forms a government with the centre-left.
But now the AfD has more than 150 seats in parliament, its supporters in particular believe it is time for the firewall to go.
"I just hope that the firewall will fall. But we all know that it won't be like that," says pro-AfD TikTok influencer Celina Brychcy, 26.
"I think it will fall at the latest when new elections are held. Then they'll have to realise at some point they can't get through with what they're doing right now."
"I think the Brandmauer will stay," says Dominic, 30, who voted for the AfD in Saxony. "I want the government to really think about their own people and their own country."

Conservatives celebrate, but AfD doubles vote
Pressure to take down the long-standing firewall is not just coming from the AfD, but from leading figures in the Trump administration too, including US Vice-President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who has repeatedly backed the party.
Most of the voices you hear challenging the firewall come from the east, which may not be surprising considering the deep reach of the AfD, especially in the five eastern states out of a total of 16 across Germany.
They won 38.6% of the vote in Thuringia and 37.% in both Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, far ahead of the CDU. It makes them increasingly difficult to keep at arm's length.
On one of the big talkshows on German TV on Monday night, Harsh but Fair, one local mayor from Saxony, Mirko Geissler, believed the AfD should be put on the "playing field", so they could show what they could do. If not, they would end up surging to 40-50% in the polls, he warned.
Liane Bach, an independent mayor from a village in Thuringia said that in her region, "AfD voters aren't right-wing extremists".
A CDU politician on the programme, Phillip Amthor, conceded there should be "no firewalls between the democratic parties and people who vote AfD".
That is the main issue the big national parties will have to address. How to avoid ostracising AfD voters who clearly have no problem with the firewall being breached.
One mayor pointed out that one of her fellow residents who was also an AfD councillor was fixing the local fountain. It made no sense not to work with him.
Prof Conrad Ziller from the University of Duisburg-Essen believes the greatest threat to the firewall could come at state level, rather than nationally.
"If you have trouble building a coalition in a state, then at some point, there could be a minority government that relies on the AfD, or gets votes from the AfD from time to time."
On a national level, the worst-case scenario would be for a breakdown in a Merz-led coalition: "Merz could make mistakes. If he gets really tough on immigration, it might become problematic with the SPD."
Germany has already seen one early election because of a coalition collapse, and the AfD's Alice Weidel has made clear she is looking for early elections.
Her repeated appearances on TV election debates have made her a prominent figure in Germany and helped raise her party's profile.
But it was the constant focus on migration and security that became the number one issue for AfD voters, partly fuelled by three deadly attacks, all allegedly carried out by immigrants.
Tackling insecurity, and the perception of it, will be an immediate task for the next government, when it eventually takes shape.
Underlying the urgency, Bavaria's centre-right leader Markus Söder said the need to tackle immigration, along with Germany's faltering economy, was "in fact, the last bullet of democracy".
There is no question of breaching the long-standing firewall for the moment.
And the general secretary of Merz's party, Tom Unger, was adamant that there should be no collaboration with a party that opposed Germany's ties with the West, its membership of Nato and "the European idea".
That was incompatible, he said, with the conservatives' "core DNA".

Text: At least 10 people have died in floods in the Argentine port city of Bahía Blanca, following torrential rains.
Eight hours of non-stop rainfall destroyed roads and bridges on Friday, flooding buildings and leaving large parts of the city without electricity.
More than 1,100 people had to leave their homes and newborn babies were evacuated from a hospital.
On Saturday city officials warned that the death toll could rise. The provincial government said it was sending helicopters and ambulances as well as food and water, while the coast guard was helping in the rescue effort.
Authorities said more than 400mm (15.7 inches) of rain had fallen on Bahía Blanca on Friday. The city normally receives about 600-650mm of rain a year.
Images shared on social media showed cars being carried off by raging flood waters.
Bahía Blanca, a city with a population of over 330,000, is a major port in the south-western part of Buenos Aires province.
Provincial government minister Carlos Bianco told local radio: "We have to rebuild a city. There are people who lost everything."

Headline: Diagnosed with arthritis at 24, she set out to hike... and change an unequal society
Author: Gemma Handy, Reporter, St John's, Antigua

Text: Subscribers to Joshuanette Francis's YouTube channel – set up to document her journey after being diagnosed with osteoarthritis at just 24 – did not see the tears.
Neither were they privy to the days when she tackled the most acute personal struggles, alone behind closed doors.
After being told she could lose the ability to walk by age 40, Joshuanette was determined to embrace life, hiking every nature trail in her native Antigua and visiting each one of the Caribbean island's touted 365 beaches while she still could.
Consistently upbeat and smiling in her videos and in public, her private tears were amplified when she lost her job as a restaurant supervisor - because of her condition, she says - followed by her mortgage and her dream of building her own home.
Six years on, the young mother's sunny persona is the one she uses to fight her public battle: championing the rights of others living with a disability in a country where inequity is rife and crucial resources are in short supply.
She channels her energy into a pioneering non-profit she founded in 2023, Good Humans 268, which strives for a brighter future for people with physical challenges.
"Arthritis has changed my life so much, I can only imagine what it must be like for someone with a major disability," Joshuanette tells the BBC.
Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, typically affects older people, but can strike at any age.
"I couldn't believe it when I was diagnosed. My biggest fear was, what happens to life now?" Joshuanette says.
Good Humans' far-reaching work ranges from pushing for the establishment of an equal rights tribunal to preside over purported discriminatory practices, to a recycling programme that in turn employs local residents with disabilities.
The latter has already been implemented in more than 80 local schools, diverting about a million bottles and cans from the national dump site. Eight people have been hired to sort and process, and sometimes repurpose, the waste.
Good Humans has also launched a nationwide educational programme to encourage more residents to recycle, something Kelisha Pigott was employed to assist with.
She says working with the organisation has been life-changing.
"There are a lot of people with disabilities out there who have no one to turn to. Joshuanette has moulded me to believe in myself more. It's because of her that I took the chance to apply for university and got in," Kelisha enthuses.
She hopes her online degree in tourism management will help her eventually merge her small travel company with Good Humans to create additional job opportunities.
"Change starts with us. I was amazed to see how much plastic we diverted from landfill in a short space of time; imagine if everyone did it," she says.
There have been some smaller triumphs too. Like the case of the 10-year-old girl who for several years couldn't use the toilet at school unassisted because of the lack of wheelchair-friendly facilities. That indignity went largely overlooked until Joshuanette took it on as a personal endeavour, leading to the creation of an accessible bathroom.
"We must shift the way we do things. People with disabilities must be able to do the same things everyone else can," Joshuanette says passionately. "I'm so excited by what I know Good Humans can achieve."
Plans include rolling out the recycling scheme to private households and ultimately creating a purpose-built centre to consolidate the group's diverse work.
Still, she's aware of the challenges ahead. Even a stroll around the capital, St John's, is fraught with hazards for many with an impairment, thanks to omnipresent open gutters, crudely covered drains and cracked paving.
"Accessibility is a serious concern," says Bernard Warner, head of the country's disability association. "For a start, there's a lack of access to assistive devices to help people live more meaningfully."
Both Bernard's group and Good Humans have been calling for legislation passed in 2017, which seeks to protect the rights of those with disabilities, to be enforced. An equal rights tribunal was a key part of the act, but has never been created.
"There's a lot of discrimination; people are treated with indifference or turned away from employment opportunities," Bernard says. "And due to poverty, most don't have money to hire lawyers."
Bernard lost his right leg when his motorbike was struck by a drunk driver in 1996. Despite a lengthy court case, which ruled in his favour, he has never received compensation.
"After years of torment, I now rally for a better society," he explains. "We have to alter our mindset with how we view people with disabilities. We've been leaving them out for too long. Even now, I see high-rise buildings going up with no disability access," he adds.
Kelly Hedges, principal of the Victory Centre for children with special needs, agrees. Her school currently has 27 students aged five to 18.
"The challenge is, when students leave us as young adults, where do they go? People are still wary about hiring people with special needs or disabilities. Unless they have personal connections or can go to work with a parent, they generally just stay home," she says.
The Victory Centre is among the schools to have joined Good Humans' recycling scheme.
"As Good Humans becomes bigger and needs more staff, hopefully our children can segue into positions there, become contributing members of society and live more independently," Kelly adds.
Joshuanette believes that mental health should be a key focus of disability awareness. Despite her largely positive outlook, she admits depression struck again recently when she turned 30 and still could not afford her own home.
She continues to battle for compensation against the company she says fired her unfairly.
"Fighting is exhausting," she says. "But change will only happen when more people talk about disability and demand change."

Text: The Beija-Flor samba school has been crowned winner of Rio de Janeiro's celebrated carnival parade competition.
Thousand gathered at the city's giant Sambadrome arena to watch the top 12 samba schools battle it out for this year's title.
Beija-Flor was crowned winner on Wednesday for the 15th time, narrowly beating second-placed Grande Rio.
Its performance was an homage to its late director, Luiz Fernando Ribeiro do Carmo, better known as Laíla, who died in June 2021 with Covid-19.
While the overarching theme of Beija-Flor's parade was a tribute to its late director, it also featured floats with pyrotechnic displays and dancers dressed as devils.
The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges.
One of the top 12 samba schools competing for the title was Paraíso do Tuiuti, whose dancers paraded in exuberant feathers.
Among the incredible variety of costumes and performances, Vila Isabel's ghosts clad completely in white were a counterpoint to the kaleidoscopic costumes typical of Rio's carnival.
Performers from the Grande Rio samba school, which came a close second behind Beija-Flor, kept a watchful eye on the parade.
Mocidade delighted spectators with a giant puppet.
Many of the Mocidade's dancers wore futuristic costumes, inspired by its theme song, which this year was entitled Back To The Future - There Are No Limits Dreaming.
Imperatriz came third this year with a parade which included revellers adorned with gold and white skulls.
Portela samba school paid tribute to the legendary Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento. The 82-year-old singer-songwriter waved at the crowd during the parade.
Despite their impressive floats, Unidos de Padre Miguel came last this year and therefore will not be competing in the top tier in 2026.

Headline: The revellers making Trinidad's carnival more sustainable
Author: Anselm Gibbs, Reporter, Port of Spain
Published Date: 2025-03-04T02:28:22.657Z
Text: From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed "the greatest show on Earth".
But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.
Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival "is a big part of our culture" it also has a very negative environmental impact "from the events, to the textiles, to costumes" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.
Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.
Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.
To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.
Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.
"Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials," Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.
The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.
Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (£550), depending on size.
Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. "'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away'," Danni recalls people saying.
Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.
Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris – who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly
Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.
The two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.
Aliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: "After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival."
Now she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed "Tipsy Tuesday".
They also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.
In what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the "King of Soca" and a superstar in the carnival world.
"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces," Kaleen explains.
After sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.
"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece'," Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.
But costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.
At Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.
The organisers of the fete - a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools – also hire "bin detectives" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.
It is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.
"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass," says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.
Joseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would "add some layer of costs and more labour". But he is adamant "it worked" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.
These green efforts are being welcomed by patrons such as Roland Riley, who hailed it as "a good initiative by Fete with the Saints to go that route".

Headline: Haiti police raid gang leader's stronghold in capital
Author: Leonardo Rocha, BBC World Service Americas regional editor, Jaroslav Lukiv, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-02T05:04:04.239Z
Text: The government of Haiti says police have launched a large-scale operation in a shantytown controlled by powerful gang leader Jimmy Chérizier, who is widely known as Barbecue.
The authorities say several gang members have been killed in the Lower Delmas area of the capital Port-au-Prince.
Local reports say military drones carrying explosives are being used in the operation.
Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé praised the assault. He said it was the work of a special task force created two days ago to tackle insecurity.
Chérizier, aged 47, is the feared leader of Viv Ansam (Live Together), a coalition of gangs that control much of the city.
It is not clear whether Kenyan police officers deployed in Haiti last year to help fight the gangs are involved in the security operation.
Last week, a Kenyan police officer - who was on patrol with the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission - was killed in a confrontation with gang members.
Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.
More than 5,500 people were killed in gang-related violence in the Caribbean nation in 2024 and more than a million people have fled their homes.
Haiti's transitional presidential council, the body created to re-establish democratic order, has made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections.

Text: At least 37 people have died and 30 left injured after two passenger buses collided in Bolivia, police said.
The crash happened early on Saturday about 5km (3 miles) from the south-western city of Uyuni.
One of the drivers was receiving intensive care while the other was in a stable condition, police commander Wilson Flores said.
Images published in Bolivian media showed a badly damaged coach with its bodywork ripped off and luggage scattered on the roadside.
The buses collided on the route between Uyuni and Colchani in Bolivia's Potosí department after a "lane invasion", local media reported.
One bus was travelling to the western city of Oruro, where Oruro Carnival - one of Latin America's largest festivals - was taking place.
The vehicles were recovered by 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) and those injured were taken to hospitals in both Oruro and Potosí.
Those who died have not been identified and the condition of the injured is yet to be determined.
According to local media, Cdr Flores said police were awaiting the results of alcohol tests taken by the drivers.
Deadly traffic accidents are common in Bolivia. More than 30 people were killed in February when a bus plunged almost 800m (2625 ft) into a ravine between the cities of Potosí and Oruro.
In January, 19 people were killed when another bus came off a road in the same region, also near Potosí.
An average of 1,400 people die in road accidents every year in the country of about 12 million inhabitants, according to government data.

Headline: Trump cancels oil deal in major blow to Venezuela
Author: Vanessa Buschschlüter, Latin America editor, BBC News Online, Ione Wells, South America correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-27T14:40:11.124Z
Text: US President Donald Trump says he will revoke a licence which allowed Venezuela to export some of its oil to the US despite sanctions.
The move is a major blow to the Venezuelan government as the licence provided it, through joint ventures between the state-run oil company and US oil giant Chevron, with a crucial income in dollars.
Trump said he was revoking the licence - which gave Chevron permission to operate in Venezuela - because the government of Nicolás Maduro had failed to meet "electoral conditions" and had not transported "violent criminals" deported from the US at a quick enough pace.
Venezuela called the decision "damaging" and said it could increase migration to the US.
Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, writing that he was "hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolás Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement, dated November 26, 2022".
He did not clarify which concessions he was referring to, but the only licence related to Venezuela granted that day was the one issued by the US treasury authorising Chevron to "resume limited natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela".
The licence allowed Chevron to operate joint ventures with Venezuela's state-controlled oil company PDVSA, but barred the US company from paying "any taxes or royalties to the Government of Venezuela".
Chevron's spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement on Wednesday that "Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by US government".
In a recent interview with the Financial Times newspaper, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth argued that if Chevron was forced to pull out of Venezuela, it would allow companies from China and Russia to increase their presence and influence there.
He also warned that Venezuela's economy could suffer more if Chevron left the country, which could drive further migration to the US.
The Venezuelan opposition, on the other hand, has in the past argued for the licence to be revoked, arguing that it provides the Maduro government with "a financial lifeline".
The licence was granted in 2022 by the Biden Administration in an attempt to entice the Maduro government to allow free and fair elections.
It remained in place even after Venezuela's government-aligned electoral council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential election in July 2024 - a result which has been refuted by the opposition and by a number of countries, including the US, which have recognised Maduro's rival as the legitimate winner instead.
President Trump's announcement came less than a month after his envoy, Richard Grenell, met with Nicolás Maduro in Caracas.
During his visit, Grenell secured the release of six US citizens who had been held in Venezuela, as well as a deal under which the Maduro government sent planes to the US to fetch deported Venezuelans.
In his Truth Social post, Trump said "the regime has not been transporting the violent criminals that they sent into our Country (the Good Ole' U.S.A.) back to Venezuela at the rapid pace that they had agreed to".
He added he was "therefore ordering that the ineffective and unmet Biden 'Concession Agreement' be terminated" as of 1 March.
Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez warned that US sanctions had in the past led to an increase of Venezuelans migrating to the US and that this was likely to happen again.
Stopping undocumented migration has been one of Trump's main priorities since taking office.
The announcement had a swift effect on oil prices, which rose more than 1% on Thursday.

Headline: Chile power cut: 'We were trapped like sardines in the dark'

Text: More than eight million households across Chile were left without power on Tuesday afternoon after an electricity transmission line failed, cutting off the electricity supply to much of the country.
In the capital, Santiago, the entire underground train system was suspended almost immediately. Thousands of people had to be evacuated and stations were plunged into darkness.
"We were like sardines in the dark," one passenger described the moment their underground train stalled.
Many of those who had been in lifts inside the stations when the power cut happened had to be freed by firefighters.
One woman in her 70s was trapped in a lift between two floors in a building in Santiago.
She told local media that she had "kicked the door" of the lift to draw attention to her plight and her screams eventually alerted the concierge.
"I'm brave, I told myself 'I'm not going to die here'," she said.
Videos shared on social media also showed metro passengers using their mobile phones' flashlights to find their way out of dark stations.
According to Metro de Santiago, the evacuation of the underground was completed 90 minutes after the power cut - but disruption caused by the outage carried on for many more hours.
The 150 extra buses deployed to ferry passengers were not nearly enough to make up for the suspension of the metro, which transports an average of 2.3m passengers every day.
Long queues formed at bus stops, where passengers grew increasingly angry when packed buses did not stop.
Their numbers soon swelled with workers sent home early because most offices were paralysed by the lack of electricity.
"The power went out at 3:00pm, so we had no power at all," one shopkeeper in Santiago said. "People started closing up at around 4 or 5pm."
Traffic in the capital was further disrupted by the failure of several traffic lights.
A truck collided with a car at one crossing where the traffic lights were out and there were reports of at least one other accident also caused by the lack of functioning traffic lights.
With the gridlock getting worse, thousands of people were forced to walk to their destinations in summer temperatures of around 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit).
One of them, Sharon Ortiz, a 28-year-old waitress, told AFP news agency that the public transport system had "collapsed".
"I got to work two hours late, I got stuck in the middle of the Costanera [shopping centre] and from there I had to walk," she said.
Some people hitched lifts on the back of trucks.
Restaurants and cafes were among the businesses affected by the power cut.
Some remained open to offer those walking home a place to rest, but many closed because cash machines, card machines and fridges were not working.
Some of the most dramatic scenes unfolded in Fantasilandia, an amusement park in Santiago, where at least a dozen people were stuck on top of a rollercoaster.
Fantasilandia's manager said that while the park had backup generators, the attractions would not immediately restart for security reasons.
Hospitals relied on emergency generators for power.
As the sun set, the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew from 22:00 to 06:00 local time.
Soldiers and police were deployed to maintain order.
Some Chileans tried to see a positive in the power cut - with several posting photos of the night sky on social media, pointing out that the lack of light pollution had made the milky way easier to see.

Text: Media reports say some power has been restored in parts of Chile's capital, Santiago, after a near-nationwide cut left huge swathes of the country without electricity.
A state of emergency was declared, with a curfew in affected areas, where soldiers have been deployed.
The Viña del Mar festival, the largest music event in Latin America, has had its third day cancelled.
Hospitals and prisons across the country are on emergency generators and transport is severely disrupted. The government blamed a system failure.
Addressing the nation on TV, President Gabriel Boric said eight million homes had been affected, but power had been restored to about half of them.
"What happened today is outrageous," he said. "It's intolerable that one or several companies should affect the everyday life of millions of Chileans, and that's why it's the state's duty to hold them responsible."

The national service for disaster prevention and response said earlier that the outage stretched from the regions of Arica and Parinacota in the north to Los Lagos in the south.
Reuters news agency reported that the world's largest copper mine, Escondida, was without power, citing a source close to the matter.
Latam Airlines said some of its flights might also be disrupted while power supplies were down, and urged passengers to check their journey status.
In a post on X, the Santiago Metro operator said its service had been temporarily suspended because of the power outage, with stations being evacuated and closed.
Footage from the city showed passengers being evacuated from stations by walking up switched-off escalators, while traffic signals were also shown not working.
There were also long queues for buses which were still running on the city's roads.
María Angélica Román, 45, told AFP news agency: "They let us leave work because of the power cut, but now I don't know how we will get home, because all the buses are full."
Chile's Interior Minister, Carolina Tohá, also posted on X to say that a meeting would be called to discuss the continuing measures to restore services.

Text: A Venezuelan opposition activist who was arrested during anti-government protests in January has died in jail, his party has said.
Reinaldo Araujo, a leader of the Vente Venezuela party in Trujillo state, had been suffering from health problems, which his wife said were not treated while he was in prison.
Vente Venezuela's leader, María Corina Machado, said she held "the regime" of Nicolás Maduro responsible for Araujo's death.
According to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory NGO, 20 political prisoners have died while in custody over the past few years.
Vente Venezuela said Araujo had been seized by masked men on 9 January during a protest on the eve of the swearing in of Nicolás Maduro for a third term as president.
His wife said he had been returning from a medical appointment and had merely been observing the protest when he was taken away.
He had been in state custody since then.

His wife accuses the authorities of failing to providing her husband with medical care until it was too late, even though she had warned them that his health had been deteriorating.
The head of the regional body Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, denounced Araujo's death, writing on X that it was a "new atrocity of the regime".
He added: "No more political prisoners, no more torture, no more death."
Almagro has been an outspoken critic of Nicolás Maduro, accusing the Venezuelan leader of repressing the opposition in the run-up and the aftermath of July's presidential election.
Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), a body closely aligned with the government, declared Maduro the winner of the election without providing detailed voting tallies to back up their claim.
The OAS's electoral observation department said it could not recognise the result because the CNE "was biased towards the government".
Venezuela's opposition coalition also refused to recognise the result, saying that voting tallies it had gathered, with the help of official election observers, showed that its candidate, Edmundo González, was the overwhelming winner.
The opposition also organised protests on the eve of Maduro's swearing in and it was at one such event that Reinaldo Araujo was seized.
According to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory, hundreds of protesters were arrested in the days leading up to Maduro's inauguration and sent to jails notorious for the mistreatment of detainees.
Among those seized was Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Edmundo González.
Mr Tudares's wife says she has not been given any information about her husband's whereabouts since he was taken away by the security forces on 7 January.
She also accused the government of holding her husband in order to exert pressure on Edmundo González, who is living in exile and has been meeting presidents across the region, many of whom have recognised him as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.

Headline: 'Severe blow' to Sinaloa cartel as security chief of El Chapo's son arrested

Text: The Mexican army says it has arrested a key player in the Sinaloa drug cartel in the northern city of Culiacán.
José Ángel Canobbio, also known as "El Güerito" (little blond one), is accused of being the right hand man of Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, one of the sons of infamous jailed drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán.
Mexican security forces say the arrest of Canobbio, who they say was in charge of security for Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, is a severe blow to the Sinaloa cartel.
He was captured just hours after the United States added the Sinaloa cartel to its list of foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs), a move which the Trump Administration says will allow it to better combat the criminal groups.
As well as the Sinaloa cartel, the US state department designated seven other Latin American crime groups as FTOs. They are:
All but the last two groups are based in Mexico and the Mexican government has come under huge pressure by the Trump Administration to step up its fight against them and the trafficking of the synthetic drug fentanyl they engage in.

Earlier this month, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum managed to convince her US counterpart to hold off imposing a 25% duty on Mexican imports to the US for a month.
Mexican security forces will hope that the arrest of Canobbio - who was indicted in absentia by a federal grand jury in Chicago in November for allegedly smuggling fentanyl into the US - will go some way towards showing their commitment to the fight against drug trafficking.
The indictment accuses Canobbio of being the principal advisor, lieutenant and security chief for Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán who took over the running of the Sinaloa cartel after their father was jailed.
According to security expert David Saucedo, Canobbio has played a key role in getting the Sinaloa cartel involved in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US.
Mr Saucedo told Mexico's Radio Formula, that he expected him to be quickly extradited to the US.

Headline: Fog harvesting could provide water for arid cities
Author: Victoria Gill, Science correspondent, BBC News

Text: Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.
This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.
Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.
"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems," said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. "There is a lot of poverty", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.
Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.
However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.
Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.
It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.
However, Dr Carter says a "new era" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.
She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.
From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.
Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.
Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:
Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.
With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.
Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is "very special" for its sea fog, "because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains".
Her team is currently working on a "fog harvesting map" of the whole country.
"Water from the clouds", as Dr Carter describes it, could, she said, "enhance our cities' resilience to climate change, while improving access to clean water".

Headline: Brazil prosecutor charges ex-President Bolsonaro over alleged coup plot
Author: Vanessa Buschschlüter and George Wright, BBC News, Leonardo Rocha, BBC World Service Americas editor
Published Date: 2025-02-19T13:47:09.698Z
Text: Brazil's chief prosecutor has accused former President Jair Bolsonaro of leading an attempted coup after the ex-leader was defeated by his left-wing rival in the 2022 presidential election.
According to the prosecutor, the alleged plot aimed to prevent Bolsonaro's successor in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from taking office and included a plan to poison Lula.
Bolsonaro, 69, denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political witch hunt.
It is now up to Brazil's Supreme Court to decide whether to accept the prosecutor's charges and put Bolsonaro and 33 others accused on trial.
In a sign of how divided Brazil remains two-and-a-half years after the bitterly fought presidential election, critics of Bolsonaro celebrated news of the charges, saying that the former president belonged in jail, while his supporters insisted he was innocent.
The focus is now on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who will have to weigh up the merits of the accusations made by the chief prosecutor and decide whether the case should proceed to the trial stage.
There is no deadline for Mr Moraes to make his decision, but legal experts quoted in Brazilian media said they expected him to rule in favour of a trial, which could get under way later this year.
Political analysts say a potential trial could have an impact on the 2026 presidential election.
While Bolsonaro is barred from running for office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he remains a strong political force.
Many think he could use a potential trial as a platform for his agenda.
In his 272-page report, Attorney-General Paulo Gonet said that he had concluded that Bolsonaro and the 33 other accused had formed a criminal group which had tried to instigate a coup against Lula's newly elected government - an allegation those named have denied.
The document alleges that Bolsonaro and his vice-presidential candidate Walter Braga Netto led the group.
"Allied with other individuals, including civilians and military personnel, they attempted to prevent, in a co-ordinated manner, the result of the 2022 presidential elections from being fulfilled," it reads.
According to the report, the alleged plot included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Alexandre de Moraes - the same Supreme Court justice now tasked with deciding whether the case should proceed to trial.
The prosecutor's charges are based on a police investigation into the events leading up to 8 January 2023, when Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the capital, Brasilia.
Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 people.
Bolsonaro was in the United States at the time and has always denied any links to the rioters. But the prosecutor's report alleges that he started sowing doubts about Brazil's voting system as early as July 2021, which are thought to have encouraged those storming Congress.
Lawyers representing the former president said they were "astonished" by the accusations levelled against their client and insisted that he had never supported any movement aimed at dismantling Brazil's democratic rule of law or the institutions that uphold it.
The said the prosecutor had come up with a "fanciful narrative" that would not stand up to legal scrutiny.

Text: A British journalist has been reported missing in Brazil, prompting concerns from an association of foreign correspondents which has urged authorities to step up search efforts.
Charlotte Peet, 32, is understood to have last contacted a friend on 8 February, saying she was in São Paulo and planned to travel to Rio de Janeiro. She has not been heard from since.
Days later, her UK-based family told the friend they had lost contact with her. They have provided authorities with details of her flight and a copy of her passport to aid the search.
The Association of Foreign Press Correspondents in Brazil (ACIE) released a statement "expressing concern over her disappearance and solidarity with her family and friends".
According to the statement, someone initially reported the case to police in Rio before it was transferred to São Paulo, where she was last seen.
The statement also added that Brazil's Department of Homicides and Personal Protection (DHPP) was assisting in the case.
According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms Peet has worked as a freelance journalist in Rio and London for outlets including Al Jazeera and the Times.
"Her disappearance has sparked growing concern among colleagues and journalists in the region, with ACIE calling for intensified efforts to locate her as soon as possible", a statement on behalf of its president Edmar Figueiredo and its board of directors said.
A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: "We are supporting the family of a British woman who has been reported as missing in Brazil and are in contact with the local authorities."

Text: More than 30 people have been killed in a bus crash on a mountain road in Bolivia, police say.
The vehicle plunged almost 800m (2625 ft) into a ravine in the southwestern district of Yocalla, an officer said.
Fourteen people were also injured, including four children, an official from a local hospital said in a video.
Bolivia has notoriously dangerous roads, particularly in mountainous areas.
The accident happened between the cities of Potosí and Oruro, police said.
Officials believe that the crash could have been caused by speeding, with the driver "unable" to control the bus, police colonel Victor Benavides told the AFP news agency.
This is believed to be the most serious road accident reported in the South American country so far this year.
Local news outlet Unitel reported that several of those injured were in a serious condition.
Deadly road accidents are common in Bolivia.
Last month, 19 people were killed when another bus came off a road, also near Potosí.
Road accidents kill an average of 1,400 people every year in the country of about 12 million inhabitants, according to government data.

Text: The Mexican army says it has seized more than four tonnes of methamphetamine in raids conducted in the violence-wracked state of Sinaloa over the weekend.
Soldiers raided warehouses and drug labs in Higueras de Abuya, a village about 75km (45 miles) south of the state capital, Culiacán.
A spokesman for the army said the seizure of such a large amount of the synthetic drug - which in some forms is known by its street name crystal meth - would constitute a hard blow to whichever criminal gang was behind the labs.
Mexico's security minister has deployed thousands of troops to the northern state of Sinaloa an effort to reign in the drug cartels that are active there.
The seizure of the powerful and highly addictive stimulant comes just two weeks after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum managed to convince US President Donald Trump to hold off imposing a 25% duty on Mexican imports to the US for a month.
One of the reasons Trump had cited for imposing the tariffs was the flow of drugs from Mexico to the US.
He also accused the Mexican government of having "an intolerable alliance" with drug trafficking organisations.
While the deployment of some extra troops to Sinaloa predates the spat between the US and Mexico over tariffs, the seizure of the methamphetamine stash will be welcome news to the Mexican government, which wants to demonstrate to the US that it is playing its part in trying to combat drug cartels.
Hamlet Toledo, deputy operative chief of the army general staff, told reporters that in addition to the four tonnes of methamphetamine seized this weekend, the army had also secured another large meth stash last week, bringing the total to more than five tonnes.
General Toledo said that one of the warehouses where the drugs were found appeared to have housed between 15 and 20 people, who are thought to have fled before the soldiers arrived.
The soldiers who located the labs had become suspicious when they spotted vats of precursor chemicals - needed to make the drug - outside the properties.

Headline: Raisins or not? Pudding debate splits island nation

Text: It is not cricket or politics that triggers the most ardent debate in Antigua and Barbuda.
It is the ingredients of a beloved national dish.
The question of whether "ducana" – a sweet potato and coconut dumpling – should or should not contain raisins has divided local residents for decades.
The piquant pudding is one of many foods widely eaten in the Caribbean country that has its origins in Africa and has survived to this day.
And its inclusion in a national inventory of cultural heritage currently being created looks set to reignite the jocular dispute.
Antigua and Barbuda's traditional food is just one aspect of the work under way to preserve the twin isles' distinct features for posterity.
The inventory will also include its unique dialect, bush medicine, games, crafts, architecture and boat-building techniques.
The mammoth venture, being funded by the United Nations cultural body, Unesco, follows concerns that key elements of the country's cultural identity are being lost, explains project leader Dr Hazra Medica.
"There is no longer the traditional transmission of knowledge from older to younger people," she tells the BBC.
"Without that, we start to lose the sense of who we are. Outside influences can dilute indigenous culture and people fear that what is peculiarly Antiguan will be lost."
More than two dozen specially trained data collectors have been tasked with interviewing residents from each parish, gathering stories, photos and information. The results will be meticulously entered into a publicly accessible database.
Local author Joy Lawrence needed little encouragement to take part.
The former schoolteacher's books focus heavily on the country's Creole/English dialect that weaves in many African words from Antiguans' ancestors.
English may be the main language but patois, spoken at accelerated speed, is ubiquitous and routinely used to show kinship and camaraderie.
"When the British brought Africans here, they could not speak English and the British could not speak African languages. Because the Africans came from all over and spoke different languages, they could not even converse among themselves for the most part," Ms Lawrence says.
"To communicate, the Africans borrowed some vocabulary from the British and incorporated their own pronunciation and syntax to form a pidgin thing. Over the generations, it became perfected and developed structure and grammar."
A couple of generations ago, Antiguan dialect was sneered at and children were commonly forbidden to speak it in school. There are still some who look down their nose at it today, Ms Lawrence scoffs.
"Our forebears worked hard to coin that language," she asserts. "It's our first language; how can we not preserve what's ours? It's not a written language and we spell it any old how, but it has rhythm and I'm proud of it."
The dialect is characterised by an "economy of words" and sparse pronouns, she continues.
"We don't waste time to say 'not at all'; we just say 'tarl'. Instead of 'come here', we say 'cumyah'. And we never say her or him; it's always she or he."
In places such as school and church, dialect is used for "emphasis, clarity and reinforcement". "Because we think in it," Ms Lawrence adds.
Disagreements over the "correct" way of doing something is one reason for the decline of some cultural practices, Dr Medica believes.
Varying methods of stirring "fungee", a cornmeal paste which also hails from the mother continent, and precisely what to add to it is another subject of friendly bickering.
"There's this idea that this is how it's done and should always be done. Sometimes younger people are turned off by not doing it 'right'.
"In the workshops, we saw the 'fungee war'. Antiguans say it should have okra in it, while Barbudans add peas, which made some gasp in shock," Dr Medica smiles.
Novella Payne – who produces a range of teas, sauces and seasonings under her "Granma Aki" brand – learnt everything she knows from her mother and grandmother, but adds her "own twist" to time-honoured recipes.
"The seasoning is what sets Antiguan food apart – garlic, onion, thyme and seasoning peppers," she explains.
Many of Ms Payne's creations feature local medicinal plants, long used to treat everything from coughs and fever to rashes and nausea. Soursop, lemongrass, noni and moringa regularly appear in her syrups and juices.
"Our food is delicious, nutritious and should be preserved because it's part of our culture and heritage," she adds.
The project recently got under way in Antigua's sister isle, Barbuda, where Dwight Benjamin is striving to keep the art of traditional broom-making alive.
Mr Benjamin uses palm leaves, which must be sun-dried for two days, to create the bristles before weaving them on to a stick crafted from a bay tree.
The techniques were passed on to him by his grandfather and Mr Benjamin, an accountant by profession, is one of few people still making and selling the brooms.
He says they remain in high demand among Barbuda's residents.
"I may be biased, but I find them more effective than store-bought brooms - you feel the difference when you use them. They cover more ground too," he says.
"It's not widely practised anymore, but it's something we should cherish and document. I'm hoping my son will pick it up."
For Dr Medica, the project has deeper significance still.
"When we talk about culture in Caribbean islands, we tend to forget the engagement with our colonial past and the impact of that. We're told that our history began when Africans were brought here, projecting this notion that we came as empty vessels with no memory," she says.
"The great thing about this work is the huge evidence of African cultural retention. As a people we can claim, 'This is us.'
"In dialect, when someone treats you unfairly, we say 'me smaddy [somebody] too'," she adds. "And that's what this whole project is; it's a claim to personhood."

Headline: 'I felt a slimy texture brush my face': Man describes being swallowed by whale
Author: Andrea Díaz & Ayelén Oliva, BBC Mundo

Text: The first thing kayaker Adrián Simancas noticed after he was eaten by a whale was the slime.
"I spent a second realising I was inside the mouth of something, that maybe it had eaten me, that it could have been an orca or a sea monster," the 23-year-old told BBC Mundo.
Adrián had started to think how he might survive inside the humpback whale "like Pinocchio" - then the creature spat him back out.
The Venezuelan kayaker had been paddling through the Strait of Magellan, off Chile's Patagonian coast, with his father when he felt something "hit me from behind, closing in on me and sinking me".
His father, Dell, was able to capture the short-lived ordeal on video just metres away.
"I closed my eyes, and when I opened them again, I realised I was inside the whale's mouth," Adrián told the BBC.
"I felt a slimy texture brush my face," he recalled, adding that all he could see was dark blue and white.
"I wondered what I could do if it had swallowed me since I could no longer fight to stop it," he said.
"I had to think about what to do next."
But within seconds, Adrián started to feel as though he was rising toward the surface.
"I was a little afraid of whether I would be able to hold my breath because I didn't know how deep I was, and I felt like it took me a long time to come up.
"I went up for two seconds, and finally I got to the surface and realised that it hadn't eaten me."
In a nearby kayak, Adrián's father Dell Simancas watched on in disbelief.
The pair had just crossed Eagle Bay - down the coast from Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city - when he heard a crash behind him. "When I turned around, I didn't see Adrián."
"I was worried for a second, until I saw him coming up out of the sea," the 49-year-old said.
"Then I saw something, a body, which I immediately interpreted as most likely being a whale because of its size."
Dell had fixed a camera to the back of his kayak to record the rising waves - which captured his son's remarkable experience.
Watching the footage back, Adrián - who moved with his father to Chile from Venezuela seven years ago in search of a better quality of life - was shocked to see just how enormous the whale had been.
"I hadn't seen the moment when the back appears, and the fin is visible. I didn't see it, I heard it. That made me nervous," he said.
"But later, with the video, I realised that it actually appeared before me in such a huge size that perhaps if I had seen it, it would have scared me even more."
For Adrián, the experience was not just about survival - but he said felt he had received a "second chance" when the whale spat him out.
The "unique" experience in one of the most extreme places on Earth had "invited me to reflect on what I could have done better up until that point, and on the ways I can take advantage of the experience and appreciate it as well", he added.
But there is a simple reason he was able to escape the whale so quickly, according to a wildlife expert.
Humpback whales have narrow throats "about the size of a household pipe" designed for swallowing small fish and shrimp, Brazilian conservationist Roched Jacobson Seba told the BBC.
"They physically cannot swallow large objects like kayaks, tires, or even big fish like tuna," he said.
"Ultimately, the whale spit out the kayak because it was physically impossible to swallow."
The humpback whale likely engulfed Adrián by accident, Mr Seba suggested.
"The whale was likely feeding on a school of fish when it unintentionally scooped up the kayak along with its meal.
"When whales surface too quickly while feeding, they can accidentally hit or engulf objects in their path."
He warned that the encounter served as "an important reminder" to avoid using paddleboards, surfboards or other silent vessels in areas where whales usually swim.
Boats used for whale watching and research must always keep their engines on, he added, as the noise helps whales detect their presence.

Text: A Brazilian woman suspected of poisoning her husband's family with an arsenic-laced Christmas cake has been found dead in her prison cell in what police think was most likely a suicide.
Deise Moura dos Anjos, 42, had been in pre-trial detention since January after prosecutors accused her of the murder on Christmas Eve of three relatives and the attempted murder of another three.
The victims had all eaten from the cake, which forensic experts found had been baked with flour contaminated with the deadly poison.
Police were also investigating if she may have killed her father-in-law, who died in September.
Forensic experts who exhumed his body found high levels of arsenic, which led them to believe that he, too, had been poisoned.
Moura dos Anjos denied any wrongdoing but local police chief Cléber dos Santos Lima told reporters last month that he was "certain that she researched, bought (...) and used the poison to kill her victims".
He added that police had found evidence showing that she had bought arsenic on four separate occasions.
Investigators tested many food items in the home of Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, where the six victims were taken ill, in order to find the source of the poisoning.
Eventually, they found sky-high levels or arsenic in the flour - some of which Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, Zeli dos Anjos, had used to bake the Christmas cake.
As Zeli dos Anjos had herself eaten from the cake and was taken seriously ill, police quickly ruled her out as a suspect even though she had prepared the cake.
Zeli dos Anjos survived but two of her sisters and one of her nieces died.
Her 10-year-old grandson and the husband of one of her sisters were also among those poisoned but recovered.

Text: More than 100 people were evacuated from a luxury residential tower in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, as a fire spread through several floors, emergency services said.
Forty people were treated for smoke inhalation and several others were admitted to hospital before the blaze was controlled.
The cause of the fire is not yet known.
The 50-floor building is located in the exclusive neighbourhood of Puerto Madero.
Alberto Crescenti, head of Buenos Aires emergency services, told local media the fire had "extended all the way to the 15th floor".
Broken glass fell from the windows, he said.
"Luckily, it was a very fast evacuation, meaning people are not at risk," he added.
Firefighter Christian Benitez told AFP news agency all the residents were out of danger.
"I heard the fire alarm and came downstairs as quickly as I could," Ornella Gril, 30, told AFP outside the building.
Mariano Pavone, an ex-footballer who played for Argentine giants River Plate and Spanish club Real Betis, who lives in the building, told Noticias Argentinas news agency: "I saw smoke and went down with my son and my dog.
"Luckily nothing happened to my flat. I'm anxious for my neighbours. Luckily it was just a scare."

Text: Police in Guatemala are investigating what could have caused a passenger bus to crash through a guardrail and tumble into a ravine.
At least 55 of the around 70 people on board were killed in the accident, which happened in the early hours of Monday, local time.
Rescuers struggled to recover the bodies from the creek into which the bus had plunged.
Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo has declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the crash, one of the deadliest road traffic accidents in the region for years.
The bus normally covered the route between San Cristóbal Acasaguastlán and Guatemala City, officials said.
On Monday it had reportedly left the village of San Antonio La Paz at around 04:00 local time.
About 30 minutes later, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, it plunged 20m (65ft) from a bridge into a creek carrying wastewater.
Photos from the scene show the bus, lying on its roof, wheels in the air, in the shallow water.
Local media said the bus had been full of students, commuters, and people on their way to the capital for medical appointments.
As news of the accident spread, worried relatives gathered at the foot of the bridge waiting for news of their loved ones.
One woman told Guatemalan news site La Hora that her 67-year-old husband had set off at four in the morning but had never made it to work.
Another woman had identified the body of her brother, who had been on board the bus.
Rescue workers said they had retrieved 53 bodies so far.
Two people who had been rescued alive from the wreck died in hospital, bringing the total number of dead to 55.
The 24-year-old driver is reportedly among those who died.
Eyewitnesses described seeing the vehicle crash into two cars before it hit the guardrail and fell into the precipice.
Investigators said they would check if the driver could have lost control due to a brake failure.
Guatemala's communications minister, Miguel Díaz Bobadilla, told reporters the bus was around 30 years old but had a valid licence for carrying passengers.
Díaz Bobadilla added that officials were checking if it may have carried more weight than it should have.
Police are also investigating a gun they found on board the bus.
The discovery of the weapon has given rise to speculation in local media that the driver may have panicked or been injured when he was threatened with the gun.
The deputy director-general of Guatemala's National Civil Police, Helver Beltetón, said the gun was registered to one of the deceased passengers, who worked as a private security guard.
Beltetón said that police were not "ruling out any hypothesis".
He added that "the brakes could have failed but we're also not ruling out an accident or a criminal act, all that will be investigated".

Headline: Ecuador election ends in a 'tie' prompting run-off

Text: Ecuador's presidential election will go to a second round after a closely contested first-round result failed to produce an outright winner.
The electoral authorities called it a "technical tie" after the incumbent centre-right candidate, Daniel Noboa, and his main left-wing challenger Luisa González received nearly identical percentages of the vote.
The pair will now face a run-off in April. The result is far narrower than opinion polls had predicted, indicating the second round could be harder to call.
As of 17:00 local time (22:00 GMT), with more than 94% of the ballots counted, Noboa had a 44.2% share of the vote and González 43.9%, according to local media.
The narrow result also dashed the hopes of Noboa's supporters, who had been buoyed by an early exit poll suggesting he might clinch victory outright.
The president's supporters gathered in Quito, waving flags, donning T-shirts with his image and holding life-size cardboard cut-outs of the incumbent president.
These cut-outs, depicting Noboa in various outfits – from suits to tank tops and sunglasses – have become ubiquitous symbols across the country decorating front doors, apartment windows, and even car rooftops.
Noboa's presidency has been defined by his focus on tackling severe gang violence.
He implemented emergency measures to deploy the military to streets and prisons to curb rising crime.
Many of his supporters hope he will secure a mandate in the run-off to continue his security policies.
"He's helped us a lot, from when there was gang violence so bad that we couldn't even go out," said Fernanda Iza.
The 45-year-old added: "The support of the military he's introduced – their presence is already helping.
"He has brought us a certain stability. There are many problems still pending, but I hope he continues with his plan."
Juan Diego Escobar, 16, expressed optimism about Noboa's chances.
"I think the majority of people who voted for other candidates will prefer to vote for Daniel Noboa in the second round," he said.
"Noboa handles insecurity well. Crime is fairly well controlled. I think he will also improve the economy."
Miriam Naranjo said despite being the incumbent, Noboa represented "change".
She added: "We need the work that he has been doing so far to continue. It's only been a short time. We were expecting a bigger margin, so we have to work to keep that support for our candidate."
Despite some successes, such as the capture of some major gang leaders and a slight reduction in prison violence, violent crime remains a major issue.
Violent deaths fell in 2024 but stayed near record levels. In January 2025 alone 750 homicides were reported.
González – a protégé of former president Rafael Correa – has criticised Noboa for failing to deliver on key promises, such as boosting the economy, cutting fuel prices, and addressing violent crime.
While she has proposed similar military and police operations to combat crime, her campaign has emphasised increased social spending in Ecuador's most violent regions.
Noboa's critics also accused him of a slow response to a severe drought that led to prolonged power cuts last year.
The incumbent also sparked controversy during the campaign by refusing to delegate his presidential duties to Vice-President Verónica Abad, citing an electoral law loophole.
This decision became part of a public spat between the two.
Luisa González's supporters see her as a chance for change.
Gonzalo Cajas, 46, said: "Why is there crime? There is poverty. There is hunger. So there should be someone who is really aware of Ecuadorean workers so that the country moves forward."
Alejandra Tufiño, 42, added: "The country's security is in pieces. I want change. I'm not saying that she's going to solve it – but let's see what happens if we give her a chance."
Some voters remain disillusioned with both candidates.
Gabriela Cajo, 39, who backed a candidate from the party of assassinated 2023 presidential hopeful Fernando Villavicencio, expressed frustration with the lack of progress on crime.
"Daniel Noboa represents fear, and we represent hope, change. We do not want a state of war, we want peace," she said.
"I think we are all annoyed with the electoral processes in the country, and the last thing we want is a second round and more expenditure of resources.
"There will be tremendous polarisation. There will be a lot of opposition to whoever wins. Once again, we will have to choose who is the least worst."
Whoever is victorious in April will face significant challenges.
Ecuador continues to grapple with rampant crime, as drug cartels battle for control of lucrative trafficking routes through its ports. Kidnappings and murders remain daily occurrences.
The country is also struggling with high unemployment, a weak economy, and an energy crisis that caused blackouts of up to 14 hours last year.
Noboa has pledged to address these issues by creating jobs, attracting investment, and increasing renewable energy production.
Meanwhile, González has emphasised the need for economic reform, social investment, and a stronger focus on tackling poverty.

Text: Tsunami warnings issued after a powerful 7.6-magnitude earthquake rocked the Caribbean Sea have been cancelled, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has said.
Officials say the earthquake's epicentre was about 20 miles (32.1km) north of Honduras and 130 miles (209.2km) south-west of the Cayman Islands when it struck on Saturday evening local time.
The US Tsunami Warning System had initially issued warnings to more than a dozen of countries - including waves of up to three metres (10ft). But, it later said the threat had passed.
Advisories were also issued by the Tsunami Warning System for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands following the earthquake - which were both also later cancelled.
The Cayman Islands government had warned residents of coastal areas to move inland in a message on its website.
It is unclear if there has been any movement or damage on land.
The quake was the biggest to hit the region since 2021, when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
About three hours after the earthquake, US authorities warned that "minor sea level fluctuations" of up to 30cm (11.8 inches) could still occur, but that any serious threat had passed.
The USGS said large earthquakes at this location of the plate boundary are not unexpected.
In 2018 a 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred nearby, causing some damage and a small tsunami, it said.
"Luckily, the remote location of these earthquakes limits the potential for significant damage due to shaking," it added.
Separately, the US National Tsunami Warning Centre said there are no alerts for the mainland US coast.

Images show the bus completely burned out after it was engulfed by flames following the collision which happened in the early hours of Saturday morning near to the small city of Escárcega.
Bus operator Tour's Acosta said 48 passengers were onboard the vehicle - which had been travelling from Cancun to Tabasco - when it collided with a "trailer".
Tour's Acosta added it was "profoundly sorry about what happened" and said it was working with authorities to find out the cause, adding that the bus had been travelling within speed limits.
Reuters news agency reported that the government of Tabasco state said in a statement that 41 people had died, and recovery work was still ongoing.
"The public ministry has informed us that the investigation will be taking effect in the prosecutor's office of the municipality of Candelaria, Campeche, for this reason the relatives of our passengers and friends will have to go to this department to perform the relevant procedures," Tour's Acosta said on Facebook.
The government state of Tabasco said recovery work is continuing - including efforts to identify those killed.
Authorities will give an update with details on the number of victims and their identities later on Saturday, said the secretary of government of Tabasco, Ramiro Lopez.
Local council Palacio Municipal de Comalcalco has said it will support the transfer of the bodies of the victims in the passenger bus accident.

Text: "If the island sinks, I will sink with it," Delfino Davies says, his smile not fading for a second.
There is silence, except for the swish of his broom across the floor of the small museum he runs documenting the life of his community in Panama, the Guna.
"Before, you could hear children shouting… music everywhere, neighbours arguing," he says, "but now all the sounds have gone".
His community, living on the tiny low-lying island of Gardi Sugdub, is the first in Panama to be relocated because of climate change.
The government has said they face "imminent risk" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.
In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.
The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.
"My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone," says Delfino. "Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.
House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.
He says he wants to stay close to the ocean, where he can fish. "The people that lose their tradition lose their soul. The essence of our culture is on the islands," he adds.
The Guna have lived on Gardi Sugdub since the 19th Century, and even longer on other islands in this archipelago off Panama's northern coast. They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups.
They are known for their clothes called "molas", decorated with colourful designs.
The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands. Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is "almost a certainty" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century.
As climate change causes the Earth to heat up, sea levels are rising as glaciers and ice sheets melt and seawater expands as it warms.
Scientists warn that hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas around the world could be at risk by the end of the century.
On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.
Mr Paton says, "it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise".
However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.
The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Martínez, fear the rising sea:
"Every year, we saw the tides were higher," she says. "We couldn't cook on our stoves and it was always flooded… so we said 'we have to get out of here'."
Magdalena was among those who clambered into motor boats and wooden canoes last June, bound for new homes.
"I brought just my clothes and some kitchen utensils," she says. "You feel like you are leaving pieces of your life on the island."
The new community, Isberyala, is - weather permitting - just 15 minutes by boat, followed by a five-minute drive, from Gardi Sugdub. But it feels like another world.
Identical white and yellow homes line tarmacked roads.
Magdalena's eyes light up as she shows off the "little house" where she lives with her 14-year-old granddaughter Bianca and her dog.
Each house has a small area of land behind it – a luxury not available on the island. "I want to plant yucca, tomatoes, bananas, mangoes and pineapples," she enthuses.
"It is quite sad to leave a place you've been in for so long. You miss your friends, the streets where you lived, being so close to the sea," she says.
Isberyala was built with $15m (£12m) from the Panamanian government and additional funding from the Inter-American Development Bank.
In its new meeting house, which is roofed with branches and leaves in the traditional style, waits Tito López, the community's sayla – or leader.
"My identity and my culture aren't going to change, it's just the houses that have changed," he says.
He is lying in a hammock, and explains that as long as the hammock keeps its place in Guna culture, "the heart of the Guna people will be alive".
When a Guna dies, they lie for a day in their hammock for family and friends to visit. It is then buried next to them.
In the state-of-the-art new school, students aged 12 and 13 are rehearsing Guna music and dances. Boys in bright shirts play pan pipes, while girls wearing molas shake maracas.
The cramped school on the island has closed now, and students whose families stayed there travel each day to the new building with its computers, sports fields and library.
Magdalena says conditions in Isberyala are better than on the island, where she says they had only four hours of electricity a day and had to fetch drinking water by boat from a river on the mainland.
In Isberyala, the power supply is constant, but the water - pumped from wells nearby - is only switched on for a few hours a day. The system has at times broken down for days at a time.
Also, there is no healthcare yet. Another resident, Yanisela Vallarino, says one evening her young daughter was unwell and she had to arrange transport back to the island late at night to see a doctor.
Panamanian authorities told the BBC that construction of a hospital in Isberyala stalled a decade ago over lack of funding. But they said they hoped to revive the plan this year, and were assessing how to create space for remaining residents to move from the island.
Yanisela is delighted that she is now able to attend evening classes in the new school, but she still returns to the island frequently.
"I'm not used to it yet. And I miss my house," she says.
Communities around the world will be "inspired" by the way the residents of Gardi Sugdub have confronted their situation, says Erica Bower, a researcher on climate displacement at Human Rights Watch.
"We need to learn from these early cases to understand what success even looks like," she says.
As afternoon arrives, the school activities give way to the shouts and scuffles of football, basketball and volleyball.
"I prefer this place to the island because we have more space to play," says eight-year-old Jerson, before diving for a football.
Magdalena sits with her granddaughter, teaching her to sew molas.
"It's hard for her, but I know she's going to learn. Our unique ways can't be lost," says Magdalena.
Asked what she misses about the island, she replies: "I wish we were all here."

Text: "The entire town feels like it is in a pandemic, locked up without being able to go out and enjoy our lives due to violence."
That is how "Jorge" - not his real name - feels about his neighbourhood of Guayaquil, a city in southern Ecuador.
His father, Marcos Elías León Maruri, was kidnapped there by the Los Tiguerones gang.
A person is killed every two hours in Ecuador and seven are kidnapped daily, according to government figures.
That's why security is the top issue for voters ahead of the first round of the presidential election on Sunday, in which incumbent Daniel Noboa is being challenged by 15 other candidates.
Whoever wins will be tasked with restoring security to the country, which has gone from being one of the safest to among the most dangerous in the region.
The surge in violence is partly down to Ecuador's location, and the soaring demand for cocaine in the drug's biggest markets like the US, the UK, and Europe.
Much of the world's cocaine, from coca leaves grown in Colombia and Peru, leaves the continent through Ecuador's ports, and powerful gangs battle to control this lucrative route.
Many of these gangs also engage in kidnapping for ransom.
Mr León Maruri was one of their victims.
Hours after he was seized, Jorge received a text. It read: "I have your father. How much will you pay for the life of your family?"
The next morning, he received a video showing his father tied up with his finger being cut off.
The gang initially demanded $100,000 (£80,000).
Jorge didn't have it and began negotiating: "They wanted $30,000 or they would cut off another finger."
Jorge scrambled to offer them $5,000 and his television, PlayStation and car.
Just as the captors had agreed on a handover, police called him. They'd found a corpse resembling his father.
"They had left my father's body with his finger in a bottle tied to his hand – as a mockery."
Jorge's life has since unravelled. He rarely leaves his home, now plastered with CCTV cameras he anxiously monitors.
His wife and daughter have fled the country. He doesn't go to work any more because the gang know the location.
The current government under President Daniel Noboa has responded to the surge in violence by militarising the streets, giving police heightened powers to use force and raid buildings, and by building new maximum-security prisons.
Jorge supports these measures but criticises the justice system.
"The government is working hard against corruption and equipping the police a lot. But it is of no use if the justice system sets them free. They care more about their rights than ours."
While some, like Jorge, back Noboa's measures, others feel they enable human rights abuses – a key tension in this election.
I put this to Major Cristian Aldaz, from the Federal Police, during a raid in the violence-wracked city of Durán, as heavily armed security forces detained a man accused of kidnap and murder.
"Human rights, yes, but what about human rights for good people? We're in a war. Mafias use machine guns, grenades. The militarisation aims to establish peace," he says.
Polls still have Noboa as the front-runner, but he has lost some ground in recent months to his main rival, Luisa González of the left-wing Citizen Revolution movement.
On the campaign trail, González has promised human rights training for the security forces - although she also expressed support for the militarisation and tougher policing, including pledging 20,000 new officers.
There is one case, in particular, that has made many Ecuadoreans fear the indiscriminate use of force by the security forces.
Last year, four teenagers were seized by the military over an alleged theft when coming back from playing football.
Their mutilated, burned bodies were later found.
Sixteen soldiers have been detained and charged with the boys' "forced disappearance" and are under investigation for murder.
They deny this, saying they eventually let the boys go.
The bedroom of two of the boys - Ismael and Josué Arroyo – is typical of that of many teenagers: littered with clothes and football posters.
Their father, Luis, clutches their football boots with raw grief. It's like he cannot believe that his sons' feet won't fill them again.
"Ismael wanted to fulfil his dream to be a professional footballer. A dream taken away by these soldiers," he cries.
The only identifiable remains left of Ismael and Josué were a finger and a foot.
Luis's anger and upset at the soldiers is clear.
"It's not like they caught and executed four dogs. They took four children away. Then went home for dinner."
"We want justice," he adds. "Children continue to be taken by the military and the government does nothing."
The anger the case has stirred may well lead some people to try and punish President Noboa at the ballot box.
Luisa González, the woman hoping to defeat Noboa, has demanded justice and government resignations over the boys' deaths.
Some voters argue that Noboa's policies are just not working.
A public transport worker in Durán, who didn't want to be named, says gangs are calling him to extort money even from within maximum-security prisons.
He describes how gang members force drivers to pay "vacunas" (Spanish for vaccines, the term used to refer to the daily extortion fees) to avoid attacks.
"There are colleagues who have already gone bankrupt. I haven't worked since they almost killed me," he tells me.
Other critics point to a poor economy, with particularly high youth unemployment making young people vulnerable to gang recruitment.
Slow responses to last year's drought also worsened hardships across the country, which relies on hydropower for 80% of its electricity, with power outages lasting up to 14 hours.
One of those affected was Christian Guerrero.
The 40-year-old, who lives in a poorer neighbourhood of Guayaquil, says the constant blackouts broke both his refrigerator and his TV.
He agrees with the opposition that there's "no plan" to prevent further outages.
The election comes about a year after President Noboa militarised the country through emergency decrees.
For Carlos and Laura Ipaneque it's also about a year since their son, Carlos Javier Vega, was killed.
He'd panicked at a checkpoint when he heard gunshots and drove off, instead of stopping, causing the military to shoot him dead.
His parents illustrate the lose-lose dilemma many Ecuadoreans feel.
They live in a gated street, their house surrounded by metal bars, terrified of gang violence.
"Crime continues, robberies continue, kidnappings continue, extortions continue," Laura explains.
But some now fear the crackdown too.
"I don't want other people to have the pain that we have," Laura says through tears.
For many voters, this election hinges on whether they see the problem as worse than the cure.

Headline: Sexual violence against children in Haiti rises by 1,000%, UN says
Author: Imogen Foulkes, BBC News in Geneva

Text: Gang rule in Haiti has led to a staggering rise in sexual violence against children, the United Nations' children's organisation has warned.
The Caribbean island has been in the grip of violent gangs for several years who have been treating the population with unrelenting brutality, Unicef said.
Sexual violence against children has increased 1,000% since 2023, turning their bodies "into battlegrounds", spokesman James Elder said.
Unicef estimates 85% of the capital Port-au-Prince is under the control of gangs. More than one million children are living with the constant threat of violence.
Mr Elder gave an example of a 16-year-old girl who had left home to go shopping, and then was seized by armed men. She was beaten, drugged, and repeatedly raped.
She was held for around one month, he said, until the gang let her go when they realised her family had no money to pay a ransom. Kidnappings for extortion are common in Haiti.
She is now in a UN shelter with dozens of other girls receiving care.
Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.
More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone.
Haiti's transitional presidential council, the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order, appears to be in turmoil.
The council replaced the interim prime minister in November but has made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections.
Children are also being recruited by the gangs, sometimes forcibly, Unicef said.
The organisation has come across child gang members who are as young as eight.
The basics that Haitian children need for a normal childhood, even if they are still at home with their families, are virtually non-existent said Unicef. Schools and hospitals are barely functioning and tens of thousands of children are not in school.
Unicef has created mobile safe spaces in Haiti to try to support children, and to prevent sexual violence.
But last year, when it appealed for $221.4m (£177.8m) to fund its work in Haiti, it received just a quarter of that.
It's feared now that with the US freeze on foreign aid affecting humanitarian projects worldwide, Haiti's needs will be neglected again.

Text: A canal in a suburb of Argentina's capital Buenos Aires turned bright red on Thursday, alarming local residents.
Pictures and videos show the intensely coloured water flowing into an estuary, the Rio de la Plata, which borders an ecological reserve.
Local media reports suggest the colour may have been caused by the dumping of textile dye, or by chemical waste from a nearby depot.
The Environment Ministry said in a statement that water samples had been taken from the Sarandí canal to determine the cause of the colour change.
By late afternoon the colour of the water had lost some of its intensity, the AFP news agency reported.
Residents have claimed that many local companies dispose of toxic waste in the waterway, which runs through an area of leather processing and textile factories some 10km (6 miles) from the centre of the capital.
A resident, a woman called Silvia, told local news channel C5N that although it is has turned red now, "other times it was yellow, with an acidic smell that makes us sick even in the throat".
"I live a block from the stream. Today, it has no smell. There are not many factories in the area, although there are warehouses."
Another resident, Maria Ducomls, told AFP industries in the region dump waste in the water, and said she had seen it coloured differently in the past - "bluish, a little green, pink, a little lilac, with grease on top".

Headline: Panama denies US claims over free canal passages

Text: Panama has denied making changes to allow US government vessels to transit the Panama Canal for free, following White House claims it had agreed to such a move.
The State Department said in a statement on X that its government vessels "can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year".
Responding to the comments, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) said it was "empowered to set tolls and other fees for transiting the canal," adding that it had "not made any adjustments to them".
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to retake control of the waterway, which is key to global trade.
The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been on a visit to Latin American countries this week, demanded that Panama make "immediate changes" to what he calls the "influence and control" of China over the canal.
America's top diplomat said Panama had to act or the US would take necessary measures to protect its rights under a treaty between the two countries.
During a visit to the country, Rubio met Panama's President José Raúl Mulino, as well as the canal's administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales.
The ACP said after his visit that it had conveyed its intention to work with the US navy to optimise transit priority for its vessels through the canal.
This commitment for dialogue with Washington remained, it said in a separate statement on Wednesday.
US vessels make up a significant proportion of traffic in the canal. In 2024, 52% of transits through the waterway had ports of origin or destination in the United States, according to the canal's authorities.
Up to 14,000 ships use the canal each year to avoid a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America.
In his inaugural speech, President Trump said he planned to "take back" the canal, alleging that China was operating it and Panama had "broken" a promise to remain neutral.
The plan was strongly rejected by Mulino, who said the key trade route "is and will remain" in the country's hands.
He also rejected Trump's allegations about China's influence, saying there is "no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration".
Trump recently reiterated his claim. Despite saying earlier this week he was "not happy" with the situation, he acknowledged that Panama had "agreed to certain things". Mulino has said his country will not continue its membership in China's infrastructure-building programme, the Belt and Road Initiative.
The US built the canal in the early 20th Century but, after years of protest, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control of the waterway, which Trump has branded "a big mistake".

Headline: Argentina leader orders WHO exit in move mirroring Trump's
Author: Vanessa Buschschlüter, BBC News, Dominic Hughes, Health correspondent

Text: The Argentine government led by Javier Milei has announced that it plans to pull out of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
A spokesman for President Milei said the decision to exit the WHO was triggered by "deep differences regarding health management especially during the [Covid-19] pandemic".
The announcement comes just over two weeks after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing from the international health body.
The two leaders have expressed admiration for each other, with Milei calling Trump's re-election the "greatest political comeback in history", while the US president described his Argentine counterpart as "my favourite president".
The decision by President Milei to withdraw his country from the WHO follows the same arguments that underpinned the withdrawal of the United States.
Both cited the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw a long lockdown imposed in Argentina, as well as concerns over Chinese influence over the global health body.
The difference is the impact this is likely to have on the WHO itself.
The USA is by far the biggest individual contributor to the UN body, putting in around $950m (£760m) in 2024, nearly 15% of the total budget. The US withdrawal will pose some difficult financial questions.
Argentina on the other hand contributes roughly $8m a year. That is unlikely to make any significant material difference.
The bigger question is whether other leaders who share President Trump's world view, as President Milei clearly does, decide to take similar action.
If more states pull out – and that is admittedly a big if - the credibility of the WHO as the one truly global health body could take a hit.
Argentine media say they expect President Milei to sign an executive order in the coming days which will begin the process of Argentina pulling out from the WHO.
Speaking at a news conference, presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said that "we Argentines are not going to allow an international body to interfere with our sovereignty, and even less with our health".
The spokesman argued that an exit from the WHO would provide Argentina with more flexibility to implement policies tailored to its own interests and to administer its funds as it saw fit.
President Milei, who describes himself as an "anarcho-capitalist", has been critical of the WHO for some time but the idea of leaving the body appears to have gained traction in the days after Donald Trump signed an executive order setting in motion the US's exit from the international body.
The two heads of state appear to share mutual admiration for each other.
Javier Milei was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his election victory on 5 November.
Speaking at a gala at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on the night of their meeting, Milei said that "the winds of freedom [were] blowing much stronger since Trump's victory".
Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether President Milei was planning to withdraw from other international bodies or treaties, the presidential spokesman refused to rule out anything.
"The president is very determined when it comes to making Argentina freer, so any link that Argentina has with bodies that go against its freedoms, we're going to do our utmost to prevent them from interfering in the lives of Argentines."
Environmental activists in Argentina say they fear that Milei will follow in Trump's footsteps and also set the wheels in motion to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement - the international treaty which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Headline: Could US criminals be sent to El Salvador's mega-jail?

Text: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could not have been more complimentary about the deal he struck with the president of El Salvador on Monday.
The Trump administration's top diplomat appeared delighted yet stunned by the fact that President Nayib Bukele should have "agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world".
Bukele had offered to take in people deported from the US, regardless of their nationality, and house them in El Salvador's mega-jail.
"We can send them and he will put them in his jails," Rubio said.
While that was already a win for President Donald Trump, whose priority has been to speed up the removal of undocumented migrants from the US, the real surprise came in the part of the deal Rubio mentioned next.
"He [Bukele] has also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're US citizens or legal residents," Rubio said.
The Salvadorean leader confirmed that he had "offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system".
He clarified that El Salvador would be "willing to take in only convicted criminals" and that his government would do so "in exchange for a fee".
Bukele also revealed where he would house those deported from the US: "our mega-prison".
The mega-jail, also known as Cecot (short for Terrorism Confinement Centre), has become emblematic of Bukele's iron-fist approach to crime and punishment.
The maximum-security prison, one of the largest in Latin America, opened in January 2023 and can house 40,000 inmates, according to government figures.
Inmates are confined to windowless cells, sleep on bare metal bunks and are constantly monitored by armed guards - some of whom watch over them from atop the lattice ceiling.
BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who was allowed to take an official tour of the facility last year after the BBC had repeatedly asked for access, described how temperatures in the cells would reach 35C.
Take a look at graphics and maps of the mega-jail
With access to the prison severely restricted and journalists only allowed on occasional and carefully choreographed official tours, the number of inmates per cell is not clear.
Some rights groups put it at 80 prisoners while others say it can go up to more than 150.
Asked by our journalist what the maximum capacity was, the prison's director responded "where you can fit 10 people, you can fit 20".
Prisoners are locked up inside their cells 24 hours a day - except for 30 minutes of group exercise in a windowless corridor.
The layout of the jail is no coincidence.
Following a particularly bloody weekend in 2022, when more than 70 people were killed in the small Central American nation, President Bukele wrote on social media: "Message for the gangs: because of your actions, your 'homeboys' will not be able to see a ray of sunshine."
Building of the Cecot mega-jail started shortly afterwards.
Conditions at the facility and the treatment of inmates has come under severe criticism from human rights groups.
Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, has described it as a "concrete and steel pit".
So could the Trump administration send US citizens there?
On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he would embrace the idea but questioned its legality.
"If we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat," he said during an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office. "I don't know if we do or not.
"We're looking at that right now, but we could make deals where we'd get these animals out of our country."
But any attempt to deport US citizens or people lawfully resident in the US to a foreign jail is bound to face legal challenges.
US citizens who were born in the United States enjoy legal protection from deportation.
There are some cases, however, in which naturalised citizens - those who were not born in the US and who obtained US citizenship after birth through a legal process - can have their citizenship revoked.
This tends to occur when the person in question used fraud to obtain the citizenship in the first place.
Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that naturalised US citizens suspected of ties to criminal gangs or terrorist organisations - such as the Tren de Aragua criminal gang or the Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13 - could also, in theory, be stripped of US citizenship.
"If they find out you were a member of any group that persecuted or threatened to persecute others, they can try to denaturalise you," Mr Cuic added.
"So, if you had gang ties and never disclosed them, they could use that as a reason to denaturalise you."
Once a person has been "denaturalised", they are at risk of deportation.
Mr Cuic pointed out that any such move would have to be preceded by a "formal court process" conducted in a federal court.
But the lawyer warned that "citizenship is not something that is definitively forever if you are naturalised".
He stressed, though, that he had "never heard" of cases of natural-born US citizens being sent abroad for imprisonment for crimes committed and prosecuted in the US.
Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, similarly said that she had "never heard of such a suggestion" as sending American citizens to serve US prison sentences overseas.
While she acknowledged that there were various scenarios in which naturalised US citizens could lose their citizenship, she said that "you can't denaturalise a natural-born citizen".
The status of lawful permanent residents in the US, however, is more precarious than that of US citizens.
They can be deported if they violate certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include committing drug offences, violent crimes or crimes such as theft, fraud or assault.
Like naturalised citizens, they can also be deported if they obtained their residency through fraud.
Permanent lawful residents who are involved in terrorism, espionage or any activity threatening US national interest could also be deported.
This last point is important in light of the executive order President Trump issued on his inauguration day in which he designated drug cartels as "foreign terrorist organisations".
Two criminal organisations named in the executive order, Tren de Aragua and MS-13, were also mentioned last week by Trump's special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone.
Speaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Claver-Carone not only praised Bukele's handling of the MS-13 - a gang which is deeply rooted in El Salvador and has long terrorised its citizens - but also said that Bukele could offer the answer on how to deal with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
Claver-Carone also appeared to argue that the mere prospect of being sent to a Salvadoran jail could drive Venezuelan gang members back to their homeland.
"I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador," he said of members of the Tren de Aragua gang.
Rubio, too, seemed to stress that the Trump administration would first and foremost want to send members of these two notorious gangs to El Salvador's prisons.
"Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal - MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be - he has offered his jails," Rubio said after his talks with Bukele.
While it is by no means clear who - if anyone - will be sent from the US to El Salvador's mega-prison, what is certain is that with his "unprecedented offer of friendship", Bukele has landed firmly in Trump's favour at a time when relations between the US and its neighbours have been rocked by the US president's threats to impose tariffs on their goods.

Text: For Margaret Charles, the new year started just as the old one ended, days filled with grief and no end to a mother's worst nightmare, after her son's life was snatched away in a brutal murder.
Sitting on the porch of her home located in Moruga, a rural town in south Trinidad, Margaret ran through a range of emotions as she spoke about her son, Shakeem Charles, who was killed last July.
"I'm being faced with it every day," Margaret told the BBC.
"There's a letter that Amarah wrote to her father for Christmas, and when we sat down for lunch, she said: 'Nobody is to sit on that chair, that chair is for daddy.'"
Shakeem's two children, Amarah, seven, and Amare, three, now spend a lot more time with their grandparents.
Their 32-year-old father was just one of the many murder victims in Trinidad and Tobago in 2024, which was the Caribbean nation's deadliest year on record with 624 homicides, according to data from local police.
Shakeem was an Information Technology technician, but his family said that shortly before he was killed, he had started working with a local ride-hailing company to earn extra money.
Margaret said her son went missing on 9 July after taking a job to drop off a passenger in another southern town.
The ride-hailing company said Shakeem's only trip that day ended at around 17:25 local time.
That night, calls to his mobile phone went unanswered. However, his family got a notification for an ATM cash withdrawal from a joint bank account.
The following day, through GPS tracking, his car was found abandoned more than 80km (50 miles) away in north-east Trinidad.
Margaret recalls how, after four days of searching, Shakeem's body was discovered in the same southern town where he was hired to drop the passenger. An autopsy determined he died from multiple gunshot wounds.
Police are yet to charge anyone in connection with the killing.
With murders soaring, Trinidad and Tobago's government declared a state of emergency on 30 December. It was originally due to last 15 days, but as it was about to run out, parliament voted to extend it for a further three months until mid-April.
Authorities blamed gang warfare for six murders over the two preceding days, while government officials said concern about reprisal killings prompted the state of emergency.
Five of those six killings happened in one shooting incident on 29 December, in Laventille, an area just outside the capital, Port of Spain.
Some residents say crime has become part of the culture in Laventille.
Joeth Roberts says that what stopped him from joining a gang when the opportunity arose was his upbringing.
"I was approached by a person who was looking for underlings, someone to run the block," Joeth recalls.
"He offered me a firearm and other stuff, but that wasn't in me," Joeth says, thanking his parents for the way they brought him up.
Shaquille Gaskin, who also lives in Laventille, told the BBC that he knew a few people "who are very excited to do the wrong things".
Shaquille is a musician who plays the steelpan. He says he remains firmly on the right side of the law, but that there are others in the neighbourhood who are drawn to crime.
"That's because that's what they know, they grow up seeing that, seeing the older ones doing that, so they automatically go into that."
The musician is convinced that there are lots of opportunities for people in so-called "crime hot spots" to be law-abiding citizens, but he thinks the government and others offering those opportunities should engage with at-risk communities more actively.
He argues that in order to get young people on board, a consistent effort has to be made to get them to stay on the right path rather than be tempted by gang leaders' offers.
It is an opinion echoed by Dr Malisa Neptune-Figaro.
The criminologist at the University of the West Indies says that her research suggests that gangs started becoming more prevalent in Trinidad and Tobago at the beginning of this millennium.
Dr Neptune-Figaro has also found that many offenders were victims themselves at some point.
"You have to look at how they feel as persons. If you feel despondent and you don't feel like you belong in our contemporary society and mainstream society, you're going to have this parallel society, where you feel like you belong," she says.
"You have to talk about what the gangs do for them as well, [why] they feel at home."
The state of emergency gives law enforcement officers extra powers to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants.
Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds said the state of emergency had already led to a reduction in murders, shootings, robberies and car thefts.
Police say they have arrested over 650 people.
However, Dr Malisa Neptune-Figaro warns that this crime-fighting tool may only work in the short term.
The criminologist at the University of the West Indies argues that long term, there should be a focus on refurbishing and revamping the criminal justice system.
But she says that there has to be a wider approach too, incorporating "different elements of society, our education system, finding jobs for persons who are unemployed, giving them alternative measures to crime, better parenting styles".
For Margaret Charles, the extension of the state of emergency has raised her hope that the police will catch whoever killed her son and bring them to justice.
"Not only Shakeem's case, but in any case, that people who they suspect and for some reason or the other they couldn't hold them and question them or probably search, that something happens," she says.

Headline: Rebel feud displaces more than 30,000 in northern Colombia

Text: More than 32,000 people have fled the northern Colombian region of Catatumbo where two rival rebel groups are engaged in a bloody battle.
At least 80 people have been killed over recent days amid the surge in fighting between rebels from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).
One official government agency said it had received reports of ELN rebels going house-to-house and killing those suspected of ties with rival groups.
The government has declared a state of emergency and the first of a planned deployment of 5,000 soldiers have arrived in the area.
President Gustavo Petro said on Tuesday that the state "had failed" to contain the violence but that it would learn from that failure.
His government has reactivated arrest warrants for 31 top commanders of the ELN, which had been suspended while the rebel group held peace talks with the government.
Last week, President Petro suspended the talks for a second time in less than a year due to the violence in Catatumbo.
The fighting has been so fierce that 32,000 people have fled their homes, according to figures provided by the Ombudsman's office on Tuesday.
Many have sought refuge in schools and sports stadiums which have been converted into impromptu shelters.
Investigative news programme Noticias Uno said it had seen a military intelligence report which suggested that the surge in violence between the two rival groups had been triggered by "the loss of a multi-million-dollar cocaine shipment in November 2024".
According to the report, a member of the Farc dissident group known as Frente 33 came to an agreement with their rivals from the ELN to "not interfere" with each other's cocaine production and shipments.
Both the ELN and the remnants of the Farc rebel group which remained active after the main guerrilla group signed a peace agreement in 2016 are heavily involved in the drugs trade.
The pact between the two groups seems to have broken down over the "lost" cocaine shipment, the intelligence report suggests.
Although it is not clear which "lost" stash the report is referring to, Colombian media have pointed out that in December last year counter-narcotics agents in the Dominican Republic seized 9.5 tonnes of cocaine which they said had originated in Catatumbo.
The mountainous region, on Colombia's north-eastern border with Venezuela, is a hotspot for cocaine production and trafficking.
President Petro, who was a member of a left-wing rebel group in his youth, said this week that "what happened in Catatumbo is yet another example of a shift from insurgent guerrillas to narco-armed organisations".
He also referred to the ELN as a "mafia".
Petro campaigned on a promise to bring "total peace" to Colombia but last week he said that "the ELN has no will for peace".

Headline: Panama rejects Trump vow to 'take back' Panama Canal

Text: Panama's president has rejected a plan by Donald Trump to "take back" the Panama Canal, telling his US counterpart the key trade route "is and will remain" in the country's hands.
In his inaugural speech, President Trump claimed that Panama had "broken" a promise to remain neutral, alleging that "China is operating the Panama Canal".
President Jose Raul Mulino said he rejected Trump's words in their "entirety", adding there is "no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration".
The Panama Canal is one of the US's most important trade routes, with about 40% of all the country's container ships passing through the waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
In the first address of his second term, Trump claimed: "American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form and that includes the United States Navy.
"And above all China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back."
The US built the canal in the early 20th century but, after years of protest, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control of the waterway, which Trump has branded "a big mistake".
In 1999, Panama took full control of the canal with a treaty in place that it remain neutral and open to vessels of all nations.
Following Trump's address, Mulino said in a social media post on X: "The canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999."
Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa operates two ports on the waterway - the Port of Balboa on the Pacific side of the route while Cristobal operates on the Atlantic end.
Around 5% of global maritime trade passes through the 51-mile Panama Canal.
Last week, Marco Rubio, Trump's nominee for secretary of state, told a senate confirmation hearing "the very legitimate concern is these companies control both ends of this canal and at a time of conflict and the Chinese tell them 'shut it down and don't let the US go through there' we got a big, big problem. A big economic problem and a big national security and defence problem".
In his speech, Trump said that he wanted to be a "peacemaker" but Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia under President Obama wrote on social media: "You can't be a president of peace and take back the Panama Canal."
As well as the Panama Canal, Trump has previously also said he wanted to acquire Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory. Denmark rejected any suggestion they would give it up.
Trump did not mention Greenland in his address but he set out his expansionist vision for the next four years.
"The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons," he said.

Headline: Colombian drug gang violence kills 60 people

Text: The death toll from attacks by a rebel group in Colombia's Catatumbo region has risen to 60, the country's human rights office has said.
Rival factions have been vying for control of the cocaine trade in the region - which sits near the border with Venezuela - for years.
The Ombudsman's Office said the latest violence involved the National Liberation Army (ELN) - the largest armed group still active in Colombia - and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which signed a peace treaty with the state in 2016.
The attacks broke an uneasy truce between the guerrilla groups, which had been in peace negotiations with the government.
The Ombudsman's Office, a government agency that oversees the protection of citizens' human and civil rights, previously reported that 40 had died in the violence.
It said that many people, including community leaders and their families, were facing a "special risk" of being kidnapped or killed at the hands of the ELN. It noted that 20 people had recently been kidnapped, half of whom were women.
The office said that among those killed were seven peace treaty signatories and Carmelo Guerrero, the leader of the Association for Peasant Unity in Catatumbo (Asuncat), a local advocacy group.
Asuncat wrote on social media on Friday that Roger Quintero and Freiman Velasquez, members of its board of directors, had not been seen since the previous day, and that it suspected armed groups had taken them.
"In some communities in the region, food shortages are beginning to be reported, affecting local communities," the Ombudsman's Office wrote in a statement on Saturday, adding that thousands of people are believed to have been displaced by the violence.
"Elderly people, children, adolescents, pregnant women and people with disabilities are suffering the consequences of these events."
"Catatumbo is once again stained with blood," the Association of Mothers of Catatumbo for Peace wrote on Friday.
"The bullets exchanged not only hurt those who hold the weapons, but also tear apart the dreams of our communities, break up families and sow terror in the hears of our children."
The Ombudsman's Office appeared to lay the blame for the latest violence on the ELN, which had been in peace talks with the Colombian government until they were suspended on Friday due to the violence in Catatumbo.
President Gustavo Petro - who since his election in 2022 has sought to end violence between armed groups in the country - accused the ELN of "war crimes" and said the group "shows no willingness to make peace".
The ELN accused Farc of having initiated the conflict by killing civilians in a statement on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. Farc has not publicly responded to the allegation.
On Saturday, the Colombian army announced it was sending additional troops to the region in an effort to restore peace.

Text: A statue of the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro has been reinstalled in the centre of Lima, the capital of Peru, more than 20 years after it had been removed.
The sculpture was unveiled during a ceremony marking the 490th anniversary of the city's founding.
Pizarro founded Lima in 1535 after defeating the Inca Empire and claiming their lands for the Spanish crown.
Indigenous leaders say he was a mass murderer who destroyed their culture, while those who supported the statue's return said Peru should not erase its history.
The monument, which shows Pizarro on horseback with his sword drawn, was created by the American sculptor Charles Rumsey and offered by his widow to commemorate the city's fourth centenary in 1935.
In 2003, it was moved to a park next to train tracks outside the city centre following calls for its removal.
Luis Bogdanovich, who was in charge of restoring the historic centre, told local media the statue had become damaged by the constant passing of trains, which caused it to crack.
Rafael López Aliaga, Lima's mayor, and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, president of the Community of Madrid, presented the bronze statue on Saturday alongside Mr Bogdanovich and several descendants of Pizarro in Lima's main square, Plaza de Armas.
Díaz Ayuso said the ceremony was commemorating "not only the birth of a city, but also the beginning of a historic encounter that forever transformed the world", the Spanish daily El Pais reported.
Dozens of Peruvians held a demonstration nearby opposing its return, according to the AFP news agency.
"This is an offence, an offence to all the indigenous peoples of Peru, Latin America and the world," one person said.

Headline: Cuba releases jailed activist Jose Daniel Ferrer

Text: A leading Cuban dissident and activist has been released from jail as part of a wider prisoner release deal between the Cuban government and the United States.
Jose Daniel Ferrer spent more than three years in prison following anti-government protests that swept through the Communist-run island in 2021.
Under the agreement brokered by the Catholic Church, outgoing US President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism just days before the end of his term.
In return, Cuba said it would free 553 people, many of whom were detained during the anti-government protests.
The island began releasing the first of hundreds of prisoners on Wednesday, freeing about 20 people, according to local NGOs.
Ferrer is one of the most recognised names among Cuban dissidents and pro-democracy activists. The 54-year-old leader of Cuba's Patriotic Union (Unpacu), an opposition group in the country, was jailed and charged with public disorder following the 2021 protests.
"I am at home, in fair health, but with the courage to continue fighting for the freedom of Cuba," Ferrer told Reuters in a phone conversation.
Many of the prisoners released this week were arrested in association with 2021 protests, during which citizens demanded that the Cuban government do more to ease widespread food shortages and lower spiralling prices.
Biden's move to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism came just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, has been critical of the decision to ease sanctions on Cuba, hinting that it could be reversed.
Speaking at his Senate nomination hearing on Wednesday, Rubio said referring to some of the sanctions on Cuba that the Biden administration rescinded on Tuesday that "the new administration is not bound by that decision".
Earlier, Trump's choice for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Fox News that "anything [the Biden administration] are doing right now, we can do back, and no-one should be under any illusion in terms of a change in Cuba policy".
The Cuban government says the island's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism is deeply unjust and aimed at harming its economy by making it impossible for Cuba to access international banking credits.

Text: Cuba has started to release the first of hundreds of prisoners it agreed to free following a deal with the United States.
Under the agreement brokered by the Catholic Church, President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism just days before his term ends.
In return, the Cuban government said it would free 553 people, many of whom were detained during anti-government protests that swept through the Communist-run island in 2021.
While Havana has cautiously welcomed the deal, there are doubts as to how long it will last after President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, appeared to hint that it could be reversed.
Speaking at his Senate nomination hearing on Wednesday, Rubio said referring to some of the sanctions on Cuba that the Biden administration rescinded on Tuesday that "the new administration is not bound by that decision".
Earlier, Trump's choice for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, had said on Fox News that "anything they [the Biden administration] are doing right now, we can do back, and no one should be under any illusion in terms of a change in Cuba policy".
Despite the doubts raised by Trump administration officials, Cuba released about 20 prisoners on Wednesday, according to local NGOs.
One of those released was 53-year-old Donaida Pérez Paseiro, who had been sentenced to eight years in prison for taking part in the 2021 anti-government protests, during which citizens demanded that the Cuban government do more to ease widespread food shortages and lower spiralling prices.
In a video she posted on social media, Ms Pérez Paseiro said that the Cuban government had used her and her fellow prisoners as "a bargaining chip" to leverage Cuba's removal from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.
In the recording, she also said she would continue to "fight for Cuba's freedom".
Dariel Cruz García was also among those who were freed on Wednesday.
The 23-year-old had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for sedition after joining in the 2021 protests.
He told Reuters that officials had announced that he could serve the remainder of his sentence - which has been reduced since he was originally sentenced - at home.
"I escaped from hell to be with my family. I'll behave myself so I can move on," he told the news agency.
The vice-president of Cuba's highest court, Maricela Sosa, said on TV that those freed had neither received an amnesty nor had they been pardoned and warned that they could be re-arrested if they broke the terms of their parole.
There are also still hundreds of families awaiting news as to whether their loved ones will be among the 553 the government has agreed to release.
"They're desperate, all waiting with tremendous anxiety for a call from their children," Dariel Cruz García's mother told Reuters.

Headline: Number of internally displaced people in Haiti tripled in 2024

Text: The number of people internally displaced by gang violence in Haiti has tripled to more than one million, the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM) warned on Tuesday.
The situation is particularly dire in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where displacement has risen by 87% between 2023 and 2024, IOM figures show.
Gangs control almost the entire city, leading to the collapse of the remaining health services and triggering food insecurity.
More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone.
IOM Spokesman Kennedy Okoth Omondi said many of the more than one million displaced people had had to flee multiple times as the gangs expanded their territory in Port-au-Prince.
An estimated 85% of the capital is now estimated to be under gang control.
Most of those displaced fled Port-au-Prince for rural areas, where resources are limited, the IOM warned.
Its Director-General, Amy Pope, said that Haiti needed "sustained humanitarian assistance right now to save and protect lives".
Half of those displaced are children, according to the IOM's figures.
The agency described how families were "struggling to survive in makeshift shelters while facing mounting health and protection risks".
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse.
A UN-backed multinational security force arrived in Haiti in June to try and re-establish control but has so far made few inroads into gang-held territory.
The international police force, which is meant to bolster the Haitian National Police force, is underfunded and lacks the necessary equipment to take on the heavily armed gangs.
Meanwhile, the Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) - the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order in Haiti - appears to be in turmoil.
The TPC replaced the interim prime minister in November and seems to have made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections.

Text: At least 10 people have died after landslides swept through two cities in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, state officials have said.
The Bethania neighbourhood in the city of Ipatinga was the worst affected by the mudslides, which were triggered by torrential rain.
The mayor's office said that 204mm (8in) of rain fell in Ipatinga on Sunday morning.
Landslides following torrential rains are not uncommon in the rainy season, with neighbourhoods precariously built on steep hillsides the worst hit.
Ipatinga Mayor Gustavo Nunes declared a state of emergency.
At least 150 people have been left homeless in the city, which is located some 570km north of Rio de Janeiro.
The mayor said the city had been surprised by the intense rains. "There was no time for people to prepare," according to Nunes.
At least nine people are confirmed to have died in Ipatinga, while another body was found half-an-hour's drive north in Santana do Paraíso.
Local media reported that two youths managed to escape alive from a home where five of their relatives died buried under the mud.
The city's health centre was also damaged by the landslides, Ipatinga's health minister said.
"At this time, the health centre is in no state to attend to people and all the patients who were here waiting to be transferred have been moved," Walisson Medeiros said.
He thanked neighbouring cities for offering to help.
The governor of Minas Gerais, Romeu Zema, said he would visit the affected area later on Monday.

Headline: Nostalgia and passion fuel young couple running old-school photo lab
Author: Fritz Pinnow, Documentary photographer, Guatemala City

Text: "It all started as a small passion project," says Fabriccio Díaz, 28, who, together with his wife Lucía Ramírez, 25, runs the only fully operational photo film development lab in Central America from their apartment in Guatemala City.
"Now we have over 60 clients a month and have developed over 800 rolls just this year," he adds.
Arca Film Lab has been in high demand this year and is the only photo film development lab in Central America that develops every type of analogue photography film, which includes the rather complicated process of developing positives in a process known as E-6.
Fabriccio, who studied cinematography, explains that the great inaccessibility of high-quality film development services in Central America gave him the first decisive push to learn how to develop his first film.
"When we started experimenting and developing film in our apartment, friends started asking us to develop film for them and it all just took off somehow," Lucía recalls.
And so, the Arca Film Lab was born in September 2023 as a simple Instagram page offering film development services in Guatemala.
The couple have taught themselves most of the skills needed to develop film by watching YouTube videos and by reaching out to other film labs internationally and asking for tips.
"We were surprised that so many people responded to our questions. A lot of the veterans in the photo development world helped us out by sharing their experiences and tricks. We are really grateful for that," says Fabriccio.
Fabriccio and Lucía's love of photography is not confined to developing film, though. The couple also organise "photo walks" in which a group of people get together in Antigua, the old centre of Guatemala City, to take pictures and experiment with old analogue cameras.
For young analogue photography enthusiasts like Iván Ortiz, 22, snapping photos with a camera which is older than he is gives him something modern cameras cannot compete with.
"It's like having nostalgia for a generation we were never a part of," he tells the BBC.
Iván says that older people do not always get the recent hype for old cameras and film. "They just don't understand our perspective," he explains.
"We live in a world where everything is digital and fast. Through analogue photography, I have to make conscious decisions about my photos and focus solely on the act of photographing. And the best part of it is that you have something physical afterwards, and not just another data file," he adds.
Having physical photos to hold is also something that Steven López from the US highlights as an advantage of analogue photography.
The 33-year-old is travelling through Central America to document the last traces of Mayan culture and always carries a 35mm analogue camera with him.
"Photography and especially analogue photography is just the best way to document and experience cultures. Every time I get back from travelling and get the developed film back it's like Christmas!", he tells the BBC.
The community of analogue photography enthusiasts in Central America may be growing quickly, but the challenges are greater than in other places.
"It is really hard to get analogue cameras here and it is even harder to get them in good condition," explains 26-year-old Ronald Ottoniel, who went on the photo walk to buy new rolls of film and turn in others to be developed.
And there are other hurdles, too.
Fabriccio and Lucía explain that the process of buying and importing the chemicals needed to develop positive film has been extremely complicated because the import of these chemicals is closely monitored by the state and requires special permits, which has made it a painstakingly long ordeal.
"Many other labs don't offer the E-6 processing just because it's so complicated to import the chemicals," says Fabriccio.
Their business may be expanding, but Fabriccio and Lucía are determined to make sure it does not lose the personal touch and passion which inspired it in the first place.
Lucía explains how sometimes clients "put little sweets into the packages they send us and sometimes we send a handwritten note back".
"It's important to us that this is not a mass-producing business, but that every client is [treated as] an individual," she adds.
Around the world, photo labs use large machines that develop the film almost completely automatically, but in the humble apartment of Fabriccio and Lucía, the process is very much "hands-on".
For colour and positive (E-6) film the temperature of the chemicals and the time the film is exposed to them has to be exact, otherwise, the entire film roll will turn out badly.
"The beginning was definitely not easy with this entire process, but after developing over 800 film rolls these processes come like second nature to us," recalls Fabriccio.
"But the first time we developed the positive films, the E-6 process, we were so nervous because we had invested so much in the chemicals and the roll. But when it came out well and we were able to see these lively colours of the positive film it's always very exciting," he adds.
Another indispensable member of the Arca Film Lab is Toto, the four-month-old cat that is, according to Fabriccio and Lucía, in charge of quality control and roves around during the entire development process.
The developed film rolls are then transferred from the kitchen to the bathroom, as it is the most dust-free space in the house.
There they dry, to be later scanned in a high-resolution Nikon scanner, which Fabriccio says is the highest-resolution film scanner in Central America.
Fabriccio and Lucía have now also expanded to El Salvador, where they regularly collect and sell film rolls.
The young couple remains ambitious and in the future, they say they hope to establish a strong relationship with CineStill and Eastman Kodak andto expand to developing cine film rolls, which would include a complicated process known as ECN-2.
"It is my dream to revitalise the classical cinematography scene here in Central America! We have so much talent expertise and enthusiasm to offer the world. (...) with Arca Film Lab we have started a movement that we want to push further and further," says Fabriccio.

Headline: US announces $25m reward for arrest of Venezuela's Maduro

Text: The US has announced an increased $25m (£20.4m) reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on the day he was sworn in for a third six-year term in office.
The inauguration ceremony was overshadowed by recrimination from the international community and Venezuelan opposition leaders.
Rewards have also been offered for information leading to the arrest and or conviction of Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. A new reward of up to $15m for Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino has also been offered.
The UK also issued sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials, including judges, members of the security forces and military officials.
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said those sanctioned were responsible for "undermining democracy, the rule of law, and human rights violations".
Foreign Secretary David Lammy went on to describe Maduro's regime as "fraudulent".
Also on Friday, the EU said it was extending "restrictive measures" against Venezuela because of "the lack of progress... leading to the restoration of democracy and the rule of law". The bloc also sanctioned a further 15 Venezuelan officials.
Canada also imposed fresh sanctions in what Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly called Maduro's "shameless actions".
Joly said Canada "will not tolerate the erosion of the democratic process or the repression of citizens seeking to express their rights".
Maduro and his government have repeatedly denounced many of the allegations made by Western countries and opposition leaders.
The reward from the US cites narcotics and corruption charges dating back to 2020.
In 2020, the US charged Maduro, and other senior officials in the country with "narco-terrorism".
It accused them of flooding the US with cocaine and using drugs as a weapon to undermine the health of Americans.
Maduro has rejected the accusations. The US also re-imposed oil sanctions last year, after temporarily easing them in the hope Maduro could be incentivised to hold free and fair elections.
The Venezuelan president has blamed an economic collapse in his country on US-led sanctions he calls illegitimate and imperial. His critics blame corruption and economic mismanagement.
On Friday, President Maduro took the oath of office, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a "period of peace".
"This new presidential term will be the period of peace, prosperity, equality, and the new democracy," he said.
"I swear by history, I swear by my life, and I will fulfil it," he added.
The 28 July election results were widely rejected by the international community, including by Brazil and Colombia, some of Venezuela's left-wing neighbours.
The inauguration itself was a tightly controlled affair. Most accredited Venezuelan media were not allowed inside and foreign journalists were not allowed in the country.
Maduro has a few allies remaining including Iran, China and Russia but is increasingly isolated on the world stage.
The Cuban and Nicaraguan presidents were the only leaders present at the inauguration.
The 62-year-old was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised the exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.
González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support.
The Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his detention.
On Friday, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the release of all who have been "arbitrarily detained" since the elections.

Text: Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro has been sworn in for a third term as president, six months after disputed elections which the opposition and international community say he lost.
President Maduro took the oath of office before parliament on Friday, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a "period of peace".
The official results of July's election have been widely rejected by the international community, including neighbours Brazil and Colombia.
The 62-year-old's inauguration comes one day after Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado was briefly arrested and then freed after addressing a protest rally.
Information Minister Freddy Nanez dismissed the reports of Machado's detention as a "media distraction" after her team said she was "violently intercepted" in eastern Caracas.
In a speech during his inauguration, Maduro said: "I swear that this new presidential term will be one of peace, prosperity, equality and new democracy. I swear it by history, I swear it on my life. I will keep my word."
Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by the official electoral commission. The opposition and many countries, including the US, had rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.
González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support.
The Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 (£81,755) reward for information leading to his detention.
It comes as Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), which is closely aligned with the government.
Machado, whom González replaced on the ballot after she was barred from running herself, has also been targeted. She went into hiding soon after the disputed elections, and was last seen in public in August before Thursday's rally.
Also on Thursday, the United Nations expressed its alarm after it received reports of arbitrary detentions and intimidation in Venezuela ahead of the opposition marches.
It highlighted the arrest of Carlos Correa, the head of an NGO promoting press freedom, who was seized by unidentified hooded men earlier in the week.

Text: Venezuela's opposition says its leader María Corina Machado was briefly arrested and then freed after addressing a protest rally on the eve of President Nicolás Maduro's disputed inauguration.
Machado, 57, was "violently intercepted" in eastern Caracas and the motorcycle convoy in which she was riding was shot at, the opposition said, adding that she was forced to record several videos while being held.
Venezuela's information minister Freddy Nanez dismissed reports of Machado's detention as a "media distraction".
Maduro, 62, was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, reject the result as fraudulent, and recognise the now-exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.
González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support.

It highlighted the arrest of Carlos Correa, the head of an NGO promoting press freedom, who was seized by unidentified hooded men earlier in the week.
Maduro's government has deployed thousands of police officers in Caracas, where the government-allied National Assembly plans to swear Maduro in for a third term in office.
The opposition for its part urged its supporters to turn out in droves in an effort to thwart the ceremony.
In the city of Valencia, police fired tear gas at protesters, according to Reuters.
In western Caracas, 70-year-old Niegalos Payares told the news agency that "I'm not afraid, I lost my fear a long time ago".
And in the city of Maracay, in central Venezuela, Roisa Gómez told a Reuters reporter that she was "fighting for my vote, which I cast for Edmundo González. They cannot steal the election."
Maduro was declared the winner of the presidential election by the government-dominated National Electoral Council (CNE) but the CNE has to this day failed to provide detailed voting data to back up this claim.
Earlier this month in Washington, González met US President Joe Biden, who said that Venezuela deserved a "peaceful transfer of power".
In Panama, González deposited thousands of voting tallies which the opposition collected in the country's bank for safekeeping.
The tallies have been the key evidence offered by the opposition to show that González, not Maduro won the election.
With the help of official election witnesses, they managed to collect 85% of the tallies and uploaded them to the internet.
Independent observers and media organisations which reviewed them say they show González beat Maduro by a landslide.

Text: "They have already tortured me and repressed me, but they will not silence me. My voice is the only thing I have left."
This is how Juan, a young man aged around 20, begins his story. He alleges he was physically and psychologically tortured by Venezuelan security forces after being detained in connection with the presidential elections on 28 July.
He was one of many hundreds of people arrested during protests after the electoral authorities - which are dominated by government loyalists - announced that the incumbent, Nicolás Maduro, had won.
The National Electoral Council (CNE) did not make the voting tallies public and the Venezuelan opposition has described the official result as fraudulent, pointing out that the voting tallies it got hold of with the help of election observers suggest an overwhelming victory for its candidate, Edmundo González.
Juan was released from prison in mid-November, days after Maduro called on judicial authorities to "rectify" any injustices in the arrests.
The BBC spoke to him via video call. For his own safety, we have decided to withhold some of the details of his case and have changed his name.
The young man alleges that many of the detainees are mistreated, given "rotten food" and that the most rebellious are locked up in "torture chambers".
He showed the BBC documents and evidence that corroborate his story, which coincides with other testimony and with the complaints of non-governmental organisations.
Juan, an anti-government political activist, says the election campaign and the days leading up to the election were "marked by hope" and many people were keen to vote for change.
But the announcement of Maduro's victory shortly after midnight that Sunday turned what for many was a celebratory mood into confusion and anger.
Thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets to protest against a result they decried as fraudulent.
The opposition and international organisations say what followed was police repression which caused the deaths of more than 20 protesters.
Maduro and some of his officials in turn have blamed the opposition, the "extreme right" and "terrorist" groups for the deaths.
Gonzalo Himiob of Venezuelan non-governmental organisation Foro Penal says people were arrested for as little as "celebrating the opposition's declaration of Edmundo González as the winner, or for posting something on social media".
"We also have cases of people who were not even protesting, but for some reason they were near a protest and they were arrested," he added.
Juan says that is what happened to him.
The young political activist says he had been running an errand when a group of hooded men intercepted him, covered his face and beat him, accusing him of being a terrorist.
"They planted Molotov cocktails and petrol on me, and then took me to a detention centre," he continued.
He was held in a prison in the interior of Venezuela for several weeks until he was transferred to Tocorón, a notorious high-security prison about 140km south-west of the capital, Caracas.
There he would go through what he describes as the worst experience of his life.
"When we arrived at Tocorón, they stripped us, beat us, and insulted us. We were forbidden to raise our heads and look at the guards; we had to lower our heads to the floor," Juan recounts.
Juan was assigned a small cell measuring three metres by three metres, which he had to share with five other people.
There were six beds arranged in three bunk beds, and in one corner there was a septic tank and "a pipe that served as a shower". That was the bathroom.
"In Tocorón I felt more like I was in a concentration camp than in a prison," says the young man. He describes the beds as "concrete tombs" with a very thin mattress.
"They tortured us physically and psychologically. They wouldn't let us sleep, they were always coming to ask us to get up and line up," he explains.
"They would wake us up around 05:00 to line up behind the cell. The guards would ask us to show our passes and numbers."
He adds that at around 06:00 they would turn on the water for six minutes so they could bathe.
"Six minutes for six people and just one shower, with very cold water. If you were the last one there and you didn't have time to take off the soap, you were left covered in soap for the rest of the day," he says.
Then, he adds, they waited for breakfast, which sometimes arrived at 06:00 and other times at 12:00.
Dinner was sometimes at 21:00, and sometimes at 02:00.
"Apart from waiting for meals, there was nothing else to do. We could only walk around inside the small cell and tell stories. We also talked about politics, but in low voices, because if the guards heard us, they would punish us."
Juan says that many of his fellow inmates were depressed and acted like zombies.
"They gave us rotten food – meat scraps like you would give to chickens or dogs or sardines that had already expired."
Some detainees were routinely beaten or made to "walk like frogs" with their hands on their ankles, he says.
He describes "punishment cells" where those considered the most rebellious would be sent, or those who dared to talk about politics or ask to make a phone call to relatives.
Juan says that he had been in one of the punishment cells in Tocorón, and that he had only received one meal every two days.
"It's a very dark cell, one metre by one metre. I was very hungry. What kept me going was thinking about all the injustices that were happening and that one day I would get out of there," he says.
Another torture cell is known as "Adolfo's bed", Juan says, named after the first person who died there.
"It's a dark, oxygen-deprived room the size of a vault. They put you in there for a few minutes until you can't breathe and you faint or start banging on the door in desperation. They put me in there and I lasted just over five minutes. I thought I was going to die," he recalls.
The young man says that in this prison, inmates have 10 minutes to exercise outside three times a week, but many just stay in their cells.
Foro Penal's Gonzalo Himiob describes the conditions in Tocorón as "deplorable" and says that detainees' fundamental rights, such as having access to a lawyer of the detainee's choosing, are being violated.
"They all have public defenders - the government knows that if it allows access to a private attorney who is not a public official, he or she can document all the due process violations that are occurring."
In October, United Nations (UN) experts reported serious human rights violations committed in the run-up to the presidential election and during the protests that followed, including political persecution, excessive use of force, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions by state security forces and related civilian groups.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) is currently investigating the Venezuelan government for possible crimes against humanity.
The Venezuelan government denies the accusations and says this investigation "responds to the intention of instrumentalising the mechanisms of international criminal justice for political purposes".
The BBC requested an interview with the Public Prosecutor's Office about the allegations of mistreatment and torture of detainees, but had not received a response by the time of publication.
Juan was released in November, but according to Foro Penal's figures, there were still 1,794 political prisoners in Venezuela as of 30 December.
According to Juan, many of those detained in Tocorón have pinned their hopes on one date: that of the presidential inauguration on 10 January 2025.
It is the day that opposition candidate Edmundo González, who has been living in exile in Spain, has said that he will return to Venezuela and take up office as president.
He bases his claim to the presidency on official voting tallies the opposition managed to gather with help of election observers.
These tallies, which amount to 85% of the total, have been uploaded to a website and reviewed by independent observers who say that they suggest an overwhelming victory for González.
On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden met González and called him the "true winner" of the Venezuelan election.
However, it is not clear how González, for whom the authorities have issued an arrest warrant, plans to enter Venezuela or who would swear him in given that the National Assembly is dominated by Maduro loyalists.
Nevertheless, Juan says that the prisoners held in Tocorón are hoping against hope that Friday will see a change of government and their release from jail.
Meanwhile, the Maduro government has labelled any talk of a political transition as "a conspiracy" and has threatened that anyone who backs a change of leader "will pay for it".
Juan admits feeling a certain sense of guilt for being free when hundreds of his "comrades are still suffering" in prison.
But he says he is determined to return to the streets to show his support for Edmundo González on 10 January.
"I no longer fear the Venezuelan government," he explains.
"They already accused me of the worst crimes, such as terrorism, even though I'm just a young man who has done nothing more than love his country and help those around him."
"I'm not afraid," Juan repeats, before admitting that he has left some written testimony in a safe place "in case something happens to me".

Text: Lying at the crossroads of the North and South American continents and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Panama is of immense strategic importance.
This has made it the frequent object of US attention. The United States supported its secession from Colombia in 1903, and secured a sovereign zone in which to build the Panama Canal - which remained under US control from 1914 until 1999.
The US invaded in 1989 to depose a former ally, military ruler Manuel Noriega, over his repressive rule and use of the country as a centre for drug trafficking.
Panama has the largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere outside the Amazon Basin.
However, it is for a feat of engineering, the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, that Panama is famous. Every year some 15,000 vessels use the Panama Canal - about 5% of global maritime trade and 40% of US container traffic.
However, recently the canal has been hit by drought, as the canal region is receiving less rainfall than normal. It has introduced water-saving measures, meaning fewer ships can pass through each day.

President: José Raúl Mulino
Former security minister José Raúl Mulino was elected president in May 2024. He originally ran for vice-president but stepped into the presidential race late after his running mate Ricardo Martinelli was disqualified for a money-laundering conviction.
Mr Mulino, a conservative, campaigned on a promise to "close" the Darién Gap, a stretch of jungle crossed yearly by hundreds of thousands of migrants.
He faces the challenge of how to make good on his promise to halt migration but also tackling the drought which has hampered Panama Canal operations.
In December 2024, President Mulino denied a claim by US president-elect Donald Trump there were Chinese soldiers stationed at the canal, calling it "nonsense" and said there was "absolutely no Chinese interference".
He also rejected the possibility of reducing tolls for US ships or ceding control of the canal.

Headline: Biden meets exiled Venezuelan opposition candidate

Text: US President Joe Biden has called the exiled candidate for Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, "the true winner" of the country's presidential election last July after meeting him at the White House.
In a social media post, Biden said Venezuela deserved a "peaceful transfer of power".
González fled to Spain in September after turmoil following Venezuela's election, in which incumbent President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory - something disputed by González and many sections of the international community.
The Maduro government reacted to the meeting with fury, calling it "grotesque" and accusing Biden of backing a violent anti-democratic project, Reuters news agency reports.
Tension has been rising in the country as the day of the presidential inauguration - set for Friday - approaches, with both Maduro and González telling their supporters that they will be sworn in.
The Maduro government, which has been in power since 2013, has deployed thousands of police and cut off major roads leading into the capital, Caracas, in what is widely seen as a tactic to deter any anti-government protests.
But González, who has been living in exile in Spain since September, says he will defy an arrest warrant which has been issued for him and return to his homeland to take up office.
However, he has not given any details as to how he plans to enter Venezuela, where the government is offering a $100,000 (£80,000) reward for information leading to his arrest.
González has also not said how he plans to be sworn in when the National Assembly - the legislative body where the presidential oath is performed - is firmly in the hands of government loyalists.
The opposition has nevertheless remained defiant and called on its supporters to take to the streets on Thursday.
It has also rallied key international support with González's visit to the White House - the latest stop in a tour which has also seen him meet with the Argentine and Uruguayan presidents.
In all three countries, he was met by cheering crowds of Venezuelans who held up signs reading "freedom".
Almost eight million Venezuelans have left their homeland in recent years to escape economic hardship and political persecution, and many of them are living in Latin America and the US.
Following Biden's meeting with González on Monday, the White House said it would be "closely" following the response Venezuela's authority will give to the opposition protests planned for Thursday.
In the aftermath of July's election, thousands of Venezuelans who had expressed their anger at Maduro's claim of election victory were arrested and charged with "terrorism". Many remain behind bars.
Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running in the election and who threw her weight behind Edmundo González, told AFP news agency on Monday that all the Maduro government had left was fear.
"If we all come out, millions, how can a few hundred or a few thousand armed people [prevail] against 30 million Venezuelans?" she asked.
Referring to the voting tallies that the opposition has made public, she also insisted that the "whole world knows" González is "the rightful president-elect".
The voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election.
The government-aligned National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner on 29 July, the day after the vote, but it has to this day failed to provide the tallies to back up its claim.
With the help of accredited election witnesses, the opposition managed to collect and publish more than 80% of the voting tallies.
Independent observers and media, including US outlets the New York Times and CNN, have reviewed the tallies and say they suggest that Edmundo González won the election with 67% of the votes, compared to Maduro's 30%.
In December, the UN Human Rights Committee ordered Venezuela "to refrain from destroying" the voting tallies.

Text: A contingent of 150 Guatemalan soldiers has arrived in Haiti, tasked with helping to restore order amid the chaos wrought by armed gangs.
A first group of 75 soldiers arrived on Friday and another 75 on Saturday, all drafted from the military police, according to Guatemala's government.
A state of emergency has been in place across the Caribbean nation for months as the government battles violent gangs that have taken control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince.
The forces are in Haiti to boost a United Nations-backed security mission led by Kenya that has so far failed to prevent violence from escalating.
Kenya sent nearly 400 police officers in June and July last year to help combat the gangs.
This was the first tranche of a UN-approved international force that will be made up of 2,500 officers from various countries.
A small number of forces from Jamaica, Belize and El Salvador are also in Haiti as part of the mission and the US is the operation's largest funder.
In March 2024, armed gangs stormed Haiti's two biggest prisons, freeing around 3,700 inmates.
The Ouest Department - a region including Port-au-Prince - was originally put under a state of emergency on 3 March, after escalating violence gripped the capital.
Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left Haiti the poorest nation in the Americas.
In 2021, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince.
Since then the country has been wracked by economic chaos, little functioning political control and increasingly violent gang warfare.

Text: A former city councillor in Brazil has returned a toilet and two sinks she had removed from her office after losing a bid for re-election.
Footage of one of Janaína Lima's employees hauling away the facilities was posted online as her tenure as Sao Paulo councilwoman ended.
"I decided to donate the equipment I acquired with my own resources to the chamber," she said in statement on X, following a social media backlash.
"Obviously, neither I nor my advisers need a toilet."
CCTV cameras caught employees in her office removing the facilities that were installed when she took office eight years ago.
In a statement posted on social media, Lima said the bathroom renovation was paid for with her own money and therefore not an asset belonging to the council.
Lima said she had followed the guidance of the legal department, that had indicated that all personally installed resources should be removed.
She told Brazilian media outlet G1 the hydraulics in the building are "sensitive".
The 41-year-old added that other fixtures she had bought for the office - such as a glass partition and industrial-style light fittings - would remain in place for her successor.
Lima served as a councillor for the New Party until 1 January.
Adrilles Jorge, of the Brazilian Labour Party, took over Lima's old office after the 2024 elections.
At his inauguration, Jorge quipped to G1 that his team would "use a communal potty" until the situation is resolved.
"I visited the office and thought the architecture was brilliant. But she took everything out," he said.
"They even took out the toilet and the sink. She didn't say [that she was going to take them out]. And it's something that neither she would say, nor would I ask."
The new president of the House, Ricardo Teixeira said "appropriate measures" would be taken.

Text: Chile's President Gabriel Boric has become the first leader in the Americas to visit the South Pole, after arriving at a US base there.
The president said his visit to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station reaffirmed Chile's own claim to sovereignty over part of the Antarctic.
"This is a milestone for us," Boric said in footage shown on Chilean television, before adding "it's the first time a Chilean president has come to the South Pole and talked about Chile's Antarctic mission".
Boric travelled with a group of scientists and several cabinet members, including ministers for the armed forces and the environment, his office said.
Boric said his visit underlined Chile's determination to play a key role in scientific projects in the area, especially those involving climate change.
In a statement, the government said research centres, universities, diplomats and the armed forces had united to ensure that Chile becomes the world's gateway to the Antarctic.
Leftist President Gabriel Boric won Chile's presidential election in 2021 to become the country's youngest ever leader, at 35 years of age.
Only two other world leaders had visited the South Pole before Boric: the prime ministers of New Zealand and Norway.
Several countries, including Chile, the UK, France, Norway, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, have laid claim to parts of Antarctica and many more have a presence there.
Antarctica is not a country: it has no government and no indigenous population. Instead, the entire continent is set aside as a scientific preserve.
The Antarctic Treaty, which came into force in 1961, enshrines an ideal of intellectual exchange.
The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station is named after Roald Amundsen - the Norwegian explorer who led the first expedition to the South Pole - and also Robert Scott, the UK explorer whom Amundsen beat to the pole in 1911.
Scott and four companions died on the return leg of their trek after being caught in a blizzard.

Under the increasingly authoritarian rule of Daniel Ortega, thousands of Nicaraguans have fled into exile, and the regime is under US and EU sanctions. Most independent and opposition media now operate from abroad.
The Somoza family had ruled the country with US backing between 1937 and the Sandinista revolution in 1979, The US subsequently launched a campaign of embargoes and armed subversion against their authoritarian Soviet-backed government.
The Sandinistas lost power in elections in 1990, but returned under veteran leader Ortega in 2006. His government has faced accusations of using political violence, corruption and election-rigging to remain in power.

Left-wing Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega made his political comeback in the 2006 elections, having led Nicaragua through revolution and a civil war before being voted out in 1990. In 2016, he won a third consecutive term.
His rule has since been marked by a return to authoritarian methods, including the violent suppression of mass protests against pension reforms in 2018.
Ortega and his wife, vice-president Rosario Murillo, are set to assume absolute power after loyalist lawmakers approved a constitutional amendment in 2024, elevating her to the position of "co-president" and boosting the pair's joint control over the state.
Ortega himself had proposed the change, which also increases the president's control over the media and extends the presidential term from five to six years.
Radio and TV are the main sources of news. There are more than 100 radio stations and several TV networks.

Headline: Five charged in connection with Liam Payne's death

Text: Five people have been charged in connection with the death of One Direction singer Liam Payne in Argentina, the authorities there say.
The 31-year-old star died on 16 October after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires.
The hotel's manager, Gilda Martin, and its receptionist, Esteban Grassi, as well as Payne's friend Roger Nores have been charged with manslaughter, Argentina's prosecutor's office says.
Ezequiel Pereyra - who also worked at the hotel - and Braian Paiz, a waiter, have been charged with supplying drugs.
Under Argentina's legal system, the prosecutor's office gathers evidence which it then presents to a judge, who has to decide whether to proceed to trial.
According to a statement released by the prosecutor's office, Judge Laura Bruniard already took the decision to proceed to the next stage on Friday.
The defendants' lawyers can appeal against that decision. If their appeals are not successful, the trial phase starts.
In court documents, Judge Bruniard listed the charges against the five suspects, who are referred to by their initials, as is the custom in court documents at this stage of the proceedings.
Judge Bruniard said that she did not think that Liam Payne's friend, the hotel manager and the receptionist "had planned or wanted the death of Payne" but that their actions had created a "risk" to his life.
If found guilty, the three could face sentences of between one and five years in prison.
The sentence for supplying drugs is more severe and ranges between four and 15 years in jail.
Judge Bruniard has ordered the two accused of supplying the drugs be remanded in custody.
They have been summoned to appear within 24 working hours.
Fernando Madeo Facente, the lawyer representing Braian Paiz, told the BBC that he had advised his client not to hand himself in.
He said that Braian Paiz posed no flight risk and had in no way hindered the investigation. To the contrary, he had handed over his mobile phone containing chats with Liam Payne to the authorities willingly.
The lawyer argued that holding Braian Paiz in pre-trial detention would therefore be completely unnecessary and over the top.
He also argued that the prosecution had gone too far when it had accused his client of selling drugs to Payne.
Mr Madeo Facente said that his client and Payne had spent time together "during which they talked and did a lot of things, in private".
"And one of those things they did was to consume drugs," the lawyer said.
But he insisted that no money had been exchanged and that allegations to the contrary were "completely false" and lacking in evidence.
He also emphatically rejected articles in the Argentine media which had described his client as "Liam Payne's dealer".
In November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in Payne's body.
A post-mortem examination determined his cause of death as "multiple trauma" and "internal and external haemorrhage", as a result of the fall from the hotel balcony.
According to the prosecutor's office, medical reports also suggested Payne may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness.
The prosecutor's office said this ruled out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act by Payne, and they had concluded the singer did not know what he was doing nor have any comprehension of his actions.
Speaking to US celebrity news outlet TMZ after Payne's death, Roger Nores said he was a "very good friend" of the singer and they had spent time together on the day the star died.
He said Payne "seemed playful and happy" when he left him about an hour before the musician fell from the balcony.
After Payne's death, police found substances in his hotel room and objects and furniture that had been damaged.
Hotel staff had made two calls to emergency services saying they had a guest who had taken "too many drugs and alcohol", and was "trashing the entire room", it was previously reported.
Payne became one of the most recognisable names in pop after appearing on The X Factor and rising to fame with the boyband One Direction in the 2010s before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in January 2016.
The singer's funeral was held in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, last month.
His former bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik were among the mourners, alongside Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy and his former partner Cheryl, with whom he shares a son.

Text: Trinidad and Tobago has declared a state of emergency as gang violence in the Caribbean nation continues to escalate.
President Christine Carla Kangaloo issued the declaration on the advice of Prime Minister Keith Rowley, who had been under growing pressure to take action over worsening crime figures.
The twin-island republic has one of the highest homicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a record murder tally of more than 620 this year so far in a population of 1.5 million people.
Organised crime is responsible for the majority of the murders, many of them linked to the international drug trade.
According to the US state department, the country's close proximity to Venezuela, porous borders and direct transportation routes to Europe and North America make it "a prime location for narcotics trans-shipment".
In the latest violent incident, five men were shot dead in a shop in the poverty-stricken Laventille area on Sunday. Police believe the killings were in reprisal for the murder of a prominent gang member the previous day.
Under the state of emergency, police will have the authority to arrest people on suspicion of involvement in crimes. They will also have the power to "search and enter both public and private premises as necessary".
The prime minister's office issued a statement saying the intention was to "address individuals who pose a threat to public safety, particularly those involved in criminal activities and the illegal use of firearms".
However, it added that there were no plans to impose a curfew.
It is unclear how the state of emergency will affect Trinidad's world-renowned Carnival, which is set to culminate in a massive street parade on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday in early March.
The event is a major tourist attraction which brings in tens of thousands of visitors from overseas, but heightened security measures could put a damper on the festivities.
The move comes as Trinidad and Tobago gears up for a general election, which must be held by August 2025.
Rowley's governing People's National Movement party, in power since September 2015, faces a strong challenge from the opposition United National Congress, led by former Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar.

Headline: Three dead in suspected Christmas cake poisoning

Text: Arsenic has been found in the blood of one of three women who died after eating a Christmas cake in a suspected poisoning in Brazil, a police chief has told local media.
The highly toxic substance was also identified in the blood test results of a 10-year-old boy and the woman who made the cake - both of whom are still in hospital.
Five members of the same family fell ill after eating the cake at a gathering in Torres, in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state, on Monday afternoon.
Police have sent the cake for testing, and said several out-of-date food items were also found during a search at the woman's house. They added that it is not yet clear whether the suspected poisoning was intentional.
Test results from the cake are expected to be available by next week, according to local media.
On Friday, police requested for the body of a man - the late husband of the woman who made the cake - to be exhumed. He died in September from food poisoning, but police said his death was deemed natural at the time.
She is not considered a suspect in either of these cases at this time, and investigations are ongoing.
Six out of seven people at the Christmas celebration ate the cake on Monday afternoon, including the woman who baked it.
Police told Brazilian broadcasters that she is the only one believed to have eaten two slices of her homemade cake, and her tests returned the highest levels of arsenic.
Speaking to local media, police chief Marcos Vinicius Veloso said some of the family members complained that the cake had a "peppery" taste.
The family then began to experience symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and five of them sought medical help at the Nossa Senhora dos Navegantes Hospital at around 01:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Tuesday.
Hours later, two sisters died from cardiac arrest, the hospital said. They have been named in local media as Maida Berenice Flores da Silva, 58, and Tatiana Denize Silva dos Santos, 43.
The third victim, whose blood test presented traces of arsenic, died later on Tuesday evening from "shock after food poisoning", the hospital said.
She has been named locally as 65-year-old Neuza Denize Silva dos Anjos.
Arsenic is a metallic element that occurs naturally.
Its inorganic form is highly toxic and classified as a category one carcinogen by the EU - meaning it's known to cause cancer in humans.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic through drinking contaminated water or using it in food preparation, as well as irrigation of crops, industrial processes and smoking tobacco.
Because arsenic exists in soil, small amounts can get into food, though in general these levels are so low that they are not considered a cause for concern.
It is also used, albeit in limited cases, in pesticides and pharmaceuticals.

Text: At least three people died when armed men in Haiti opened fire at journalists, police and medical staff during a briefing to announce the reopening of the country's biggest public hospital.
Two journalists and a police officer were reportedly shot dead, while others were wounded in Tuesday's attack in the general hospital in the capital Port-au-Prince.
The site had been recaptured by Haiti's government in July, after being occupied and destroyed by gangs.
The Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which controls much of the city, has owned up to the attack.
Pictures posted online appear to show several people injured or dead inside the building.
Journalists were waiting for the arrival of Health Minister Lorthe Blema when the shooting began.
Journalists Markenzy Nathoux and Jimmy Jean were killed during the attack, Robest Dimanche, spokesman for the Online Media Collective, told AFP news agency.
Other journalists were wounded, he added.
An officer was also killed, police spokesman Lionel Lazarre told AFP.
"It felt like a terrible movie," Dieugo André, a photojournalist who witnessed the violence, was quoted as saying by The Haitian Times.
"I have the blood of several injured journalists on my clothes."
In an online video claiming the attack, the Viv Ansanm gang alliance said it had not authorised the reopening of the hospital, which they occupied and destroyed in March.
The head of Haiti's presidential transitional council, Leslie Voltaire, said: "We express our sympathy to all the victims' families, in particularly to the Haiti National Police and all the journalists' associations.
"We guarantee them that this act will not remain without consequences."
People in Haiti continue to suffer with unbearable levels of gang violence, despite the installation of a new transition government in April and the deployment of an international force led by Kenyan police officers six months ago.
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse.
An estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince is still under gang control.
The UN says that as many as 5,000 people have been killed in violence in Haiti this year alone, and the country is now on the verge of collapse.

Text: There are fears of water contamination after a bridge collapsed in northern Brazil at the weekend, sending lorries carrying thousands of litres of pesticides and sulphuric acid into the river below.
Four people are known to have died, and more than 10 are missing after the central span of the bridge linking Tocantins and Maranhão states gave way on Sunday afternoon.
It is not clear if or how much the chemicals have leaked from their containers, but diving operations in the river have been halted while the situation is assessed.
Dramatic video filmed by a local councillor who went to the bridge to draw attention to cracks in it showed the start of the collapse.
Councillor Elias Junior said he never expected the bridge to actually collapse when he was there and was "in shock".
Eight vehicles plunged into the river, including the three lorries containing chemicals.
People in the cities of Estreito and Aguiarnopolis, on either side of the river, have been told to avoid collecting water from it.
Rescue operations are being carried out from boats. Four bodies have been recovered, including the female driver of one of the trucks and an 11-year-old girl, the fire service said. One man was rescued alive from the water on Sunday.
The Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira bridge - which is more than half a kilometre (1,600ft) long - was built in the 1960s and is the main link between the two states across the Tocantins river.

Text: Two-year-old Shaina is hooked up to an intravenous drip at one of the few functioning hospitals in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. Her mother, Venda, desperately hopes it will alleviate the acute malnutrition the emaciated young girl is suffering from.
Shaina is one of 760,000 children who are on the brink of famine in Haiti.
Terrified of the gang warfare raging in her neighbourhood, for weeks Venda was too frightened to leave her home to seek treatment for her daughter.
Now that she has made it to the paediatric ward, she hopes it is not too late for Shaina.
"I want to get proper care for my child, I don't want to lose her," she says tearfully.
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse, and now an estimated 85% of the capital is under gang control.
Even inside the hospital, Haitians are not safe from the fighting, which the UN says has killed 5,000 people this year alone and left the country on the verge of collapse.
The hospital's medical director explains that the previous day, police clashed with gang members in the emergency ward among terrified patients.
The victims of the violence are everywhere. One ward is full of young men with gunshot wounds.
Pierre is one of them.
He says he was walking home from work when he was caught in the crossfire of one street battle, with a bullet ripping through his collar bone.
"I think if the government were more stable and had put in place better youth programmes, they would not get involved in the gangs," he says of the young men who make up a large proportion of the groups terrorising the capital.
To combat the growing violence, the UN Security Council authorised the establishment of a Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in October 2023.
Funded primarily by the US, the Kenyan-led force deployed to Haiti six months ago tasked with restoring law and order.
On a patrol in downtown Port-au-Prince, the ferocity of the gang violence is clear.
Kenyan officers drive along the streets in heavily armoured personnel carriers (APC) through once bustling areas of the capital that now lie deserted. Shops and houses are boarded up.
Burnt out cars and debris are piled high along the side streets - barricades built by the gangs to block access.
The convoy weaves its way through the rubble when suddenly it comes under fire.
Bullets slam into the APC's armour as the Kenyan police shoot back with their assault rifles through gun ports in the vehicle's walls.
After nearly an hour of back-and-forth gunfire, the convoy moves on.
But it is not long before there are signs of more horrific gang violence. A human body burns in the middle of the street.
One of the Kenyan police in our APC says he suspects it was a gang member cornered and killed by a rival group, his body set alight to send a gruesome warning.
The Kenyan officers on our patrol are by now well accustomed to seeing this sort of brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince, but they also tell us they are exhausted.
Four hundred officers arrived in June - but they are hugely outnumbered. In July, Haiti's government estimated there were 12,000 armed gang members in the country.
The Kenyans were promised additional personnel. When the UN authorised the mission, a force of 2,500 was envisioned, but that support, which was supposed to arrive in November, has yet to materialise.
Despite the situation, the force's leadership remains optimistic. Commander Godfrey Otunge is under pressure from the Kenyan government to make a success of this mission.
The mission commander says there is "overwhelming support" for the MSS in Haiti.
"The population are demanding that our team extend and go to other places and pacify," he says.
The uphill struggle they face is clear at a former Haitian police station, which had been occupied by a gang but has now been re-taken by the Kenyan forces.
It is still entirely surrounded by gangs and, as officers head up to the roof, they come under sniper fire.
The Kenyan officers shoot back while urging everyone to remain low.
The Kenyan officers say some of their much-delayed additional forces will arrive by the end of this year, bringing their total to 1,000.
And the support is urgently needed. There are areas in Port-au-Prince which are under such tight gang control they are virtually impenetrable for the police.
In one such area, Wharf Jérémie, almost 200 civilians were killed by a single gang over the space of one weekend earlier in December.
In total, as many as 100 gangs are estimated to be operating in the Port-au-Prince area, with boys as young as nine joining their ranks.
And the problem only appears to be growing. According to the UN children's agency, Unicef, the number of children recruited to the gangs has soared by 70% in a year.
One of the gang leaders to whom they flock is Ti Lapli, whose real name is Renel Destina.
As head of the Gran Ravine gang, he commands more than 1,000 men from his fortified headquarters high above Port-au-Prince.
Gangs like his have exacerbated an already dire situation in Haiti, and are known to slaughter, rape and terrorise civilians.
Gran Ravine is infamous for carrying out kidnappings for ransom, a practice which has earned Ti Lapli a place on the FBI's wanted list.
Ti Lapli tells us that he and his gang members "love our country a lot" - but when pressed on the rapes and murders gangs like his inflict on civilians, he claimed his men "do things they weren't supposed to do [to members of rival gangs] because the same is done to us".
The reason children join Gran Ravine is simple, he says: "The government doesn't create any jobs, it's a country with no economic activity whatsoever. We are living on trash, it's basically a failed state."
He failed to acknowledge the strangulating impact gangs like his have on Haiti's economy. Often afraid to leave their homes for work, civilians are regularly extorted for money, too.
With 700,000 residents forced to flee their homes due to the violence inflicted by groups such as Gran Ravine, the capital's schools have become camps for internally displaced people.
Negociant is one of those who has had to seek shelter.
She sits with her five children, squeezed onto the small section of a school balcony they now call home.
"Just weeks ago I was living in my own house," she says. "But gangs took over my neighbourhood."
She explains that she left for an area of the city called Solino, until that too was overrun by gangs and she fled along with hundreds of other people.
"Today, again, I'm on the run to save my life and my children," she says.

Headline: Guatemala police clash with Jewish sect over 160 at-risk children

Text: Authorities in Guatemala have resisted efforts by members of a Jewish sect to recapture 160 children rescued from its premises.
The children were taken into care on Friday when police raided a farm used by the Lev Tahor movement, which is under investigation in several countries for serious sexual offences.
Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez said they were allegedly being abused by a member of the sect.
But on Sunday, sect members broke into a care centre where they were being held in an attempt to get them back, leading to scuffles with police.
The Lev Tahor sect is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.
It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.
The sect accuses the Guatemalan authorities of religious persecution.
The community settled in Mexico and Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. In 2022, members of the sect were arrested in a police operation in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, but they were later freed for lack of evidence.
The events began when police raided the sect's farm in Oratorio, south-east of Guatemala City, on Friday, taking the children into care.
Prosecutors said there were suspicions of "forced pregnancy, mistreatment of minors and rape".
But two days later, about 100 of the children's relatives - all members of the sect - gathered outside the centre where they were being held to call for their return.
Some sect members then forced open the gate and tried to abduct the children and adolescents sheltered there, the Attorney General's Office said.
But the children were intercepted by the authorities and put into a white minibus, local media reported.
With police help, the centre "managed to locate and protect everyone again", the Attorney General's Office added.
Officials had previously tried to check on the children's wellbeing, but were prevented from entering the farm by sect members.
Authorities estimate that the community is made up of about 50 families residing in Guatemala, the US, Canada and other countries.
The Jewish Community of Guatemala has issued a statement disowning the sect, describing it as foreign to its own organisation.
It expressed support for the Guatemalan authorities in carrying out necessary investigations "to protect the lives and integrity of minors and other vulnerable groups that may be at risk".

Text: Ten members of a family have died after a private plane crashed into the city of Gramado in southern Brazil.
Brazilian businessman Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, who was piloting the plane, was killed in the crash alongside his wife, three daughters and other family members, a statement from his company said.
The small plane reportedly hit the chimney of a building, as well as a house and a shop as it fell.
Local authorities say 17 people on the ground were injured in the accident, including two in a serious condition.
Mr Galeazzi, 61, was taking his family on a trip to Jundiaí, in the São Paulo state, according to reports in Brazilian media.
All 10 victims of the crash were members of Mr Galeazzi's family, Rio Grande do Sul state governor Eduardo Leite told a press conference. He added that the plane had taken off in unfavourable weather conditions.
The plane reportedly flew for 3km (1.8 miles) before falling into the urban area of the city just minutes after take-off on Sunday morning.
"At the time, it was revving up. You could see that it was accelerating a lot," an eyewitness, Nadia Hansen, told Reuters news agency.
"Then there was a bang as it hit the building and then it passed close to my house and then it fell, and I thought it had dropped in front of the house," she said.
Pictures from the scene show emergency workers attending to the smoking wreckage among debris from badly damaged buildings.
Mr Galeazzi was the chief executive of Galeazzi & Associados, a corporate restructuring and crisis management firm based in São Paulo.
The company issued a statement on LinkedIn, paying tribute to the 61-year-old.
"Luiz Galeazzi will be eternally remembered for his dedication to his family and for his remarkable career as the leader of Galeazzi & Associados," the statement said.
"We also sympathize with all those affected by the accident in the region," it said, adding that it would co-operate with investigations into the accident.
The plane crashed near the centre of Gramado, hitting a house, a furniture store and a hotel, according to Brazilian media.
State governor Mr Leite said the cause of the accident was being investigated by the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Center (Cenipa).
"The entire state is mobilized here to provide the necessary assistance," he told reporters at the scene.
Gramado is a popular tourist destination, known for hosting events during the festive period.
The region was severely hit in May this year by unprecedented flooding, which claimed dozens of lives and displaced around 150,000 people from their homes.

Headline: The drug-trafficking Rio gangsters who see themselves as God's 'soldiers of crime'
Author: Lebo Diseko, Global Religion Correspondent & Julia Carneiro

Text: When police in Rio de Janeiro seize blocks of cocaine and bundles of marijuana they may well find them branded with a religious symbol – the Star of David. This is not a reference to the Jewish faith, but to the belief of some Pentecostal Christians that the return of Jews to Israel will lead to the Second Coming of Christ.
The gang selling these branded drugs is the Pure Third Command, one of Rio's most powerful criminal groups, with a reputation both for making its opponents disappear, and for fanatical evangelical Christianity.
They took control of a group of five favelas in the north of the city – now known as the Israel Complex – after one of their leaders had what he believed was a revelation from God, says theologian Vivian Costa, author of the book, Evangelical Drug Dealers.
She says the gangsters see themselves as "soldiers of crime", with Jesus as "the owner" of the territory they dominate.
Controversially, some have dubbed them "Narco-Pentecostals".
One man who has experience of crime and religion – though in his case, not at the same time – is Pastor Diego Nascimento, who became a Christian after hearing the gospel from a gangster holding a gun.
Looking at him, it's hard to believe that this boyish looking 42-year-old Wesleyan Methodist minister with a ready smile and dimples, was once a member of Rio's notorious Red Command crime gang and managed its activities in the city's Vila Kennedy favela.
Four years in prison for drug dealing weren't enough to make him give up crime. But when he became addicted to crack cocaine his standing in the gang plummeted.
"I lost my family. I practically lived on the street for almost a year. I went so far as to sell things from my house to buy crack," he says.
It was at that point, when he was at rock bottom, that a well-known drug dealer in the favela summoned him.
"He started preaching to me, saying there was a way out, that there was a solution for me, which was to accept Jesus," he recalls.
The young addict took this advice and began his journey to the pulpit.
Pastor Nascimento still spends time with criminals, but now it is through his work in prisons, where he helps people turn their lives around, as he did himself.
Despite having been converted by a gangster, he regards the idea of religious criminals as a contradiction in terms.
"I don't see them as evangelical believers," he says.
"I see them as people who are going down the wrong path and have a fear of God because they know that God is the one who guards their lives.
"There is no such thing as combining the two, being an evangelical and a thug. If a person accepts Jesus and follows the Biblical commandments, that person cannot be a drug dealer."
Evangelical Christianity will, by some predictions, overtake Catholicism as Brazil's biggest religion by the end of the decade.
As it has grown, the charismatic Pentecostal movement has particularly resonated with people living in the gang-ridden favelas, and now some of those gangs are drawing on elements of the faith they grew up with to wield power.
One accusation made against them is that they are using violence to suppress Afro-Brazilian faiths.
Christina Vital, a sociology professor at Rio's Fluminense Federal University, says Rio's poor communities have long been living "under siege" from criminal gangs, and this is now affecting their freedom of religion.
"In the Israel Complex, people with other religious beliefs cannot be seen to practise them publicly. It's not an exaggeration to speak of religious intolerance in that territory."
Vital says Afro-Brazilian Umbanda and Candomblé religious houses have been shut down in surrounding neighbourhoods too, with gangsters sometimes drawing messages on the walls such as "Jesus is the Lord of this place."
Followers of Afro-Brazilian faiths have long faced prejudice, and drug dealers are not the only people who have targeted them.
But Dr Rita Salim, who heads the Rio police Department for Racial and Intolerance Crimes, says threats and attacks by narco-gangs have a particularly powerful impact.
"These cases are more serious because they are imposed by a criminal organisation, by a group and its leader, who imposes fear on the whole territory it dominates."
She notes that an arrest warrant has been issued for the man thought to be the number one crime boss in the Israel Complex, for allegedly ordering armed men to attack an Afro-Brazilian temple in another favela.
While allegations of religious extremism in Rio's favelas first gained attention in the early 2000s, the problem has "increased dramatically" in recent years, according to Marcio de Jagun, co-ordinator of Religious Diversity at Rio's City Hall.
Jagun, who is a babalorixá (high priest) of the Candomblé religion, says the issue is now a national one, with similar attacks seen in other Brazilian cities.
"This is a form of neo-Crusade," he says. "The prejudice behind these attacks is both religious and ethnic, with outlaws demonising religions from Africa and claiming to banish evil in the name of God."
But religion and crime have long been intertwined in Brazil, says theologian Vivian Costa. In the past, gangsters would ask for protection from Afro-Brazilian deities and Catholic saints.
"If we look at the birth of the Red Command, or the birth of the Third Command, Afro religions [and Catholicism] have been there since their beginning. We see the presence of Saint George, the presence of [the Afro-Brazilian god] Ògún, the tattoos, the crucifixes, the candles, the offerings.
"That is why to call it Narco-Pentecostalism is to reduce that relationship that is so historic and traditional between crime and religion. I prefer to call it 'Narco-Religiosity'."
Whatever one calls this mix of faith and criminality, one thing seems clear: it jeopardises a right that is enshrined in Brazil's constitution – that of religious freedom.
And it is yet one more way in which violent drug traffickers cause harm to the communities forced to live under their rule.

Headline: Swimming mouse among 27 new species discovered in Peru

Text: An amphibious mouse with webbed feet and a blob-headed fish are among 27 new species scientists have discovered in Peru.
They were found in an expedition to Alto Mayo - which includes the Amazon rainforest - by scientists from the non-profit organisation Conservation International and members of local indigenous groups.
Up to 48 other new species may also have been found, although further study will be needed to determine whether they are new, Conservation International says.
"Discovering so many new species of mammals and vertebrates is really incredible, especially in such a human-influenced landscape," said Trond Larsen, senior director at Conservation International.
Alto Mayo is a protected area in northern Peru with multiple ecosystems and Indigenous territories.
It has a relatively high population density, putting pressure on environmentalism through deforestation and agricultural expansion, Conservation International said.
Yulisa Tuwi, an Awajún woman who assisted with the research, said the report "allows the Awajún to protect our culture, natural resources and our territory", as it gives them a better understanding of the ecosystems.
"[The Awajún] have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with," Mr Larsen said.
The expedition also found a new species of dwarf squirrel, eight types of fish, three amphibians and 10 types of butterfly.
This "blob-headed" fish is a new discovery to science, but the Indigenous Awajún people who helped with the expedition were already aware of its existence.
The fish scientists were particularly shocked by its enlarged head - something they had never seen before.
This dwarf squirrel measures just 14cm (5.5in), half the length of an average grey squirrel in the UK, which ranges from 24 to 29cm, according to the UK Squirrel Accord.
"[It] fits so easily in the palm of your hand. Adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast," Larsen said.
"It jumps quickly and hides in the trees."
Scientists discovered a new species of spiny mouse - named after the especially stiff guard hairs found on their coats, which function similar to the spines of a hedgehog.
They also found a new "amphibious mouse", which has partially webbed feet and eats aquatic insects.
It belongs to a group of semi-aquatic rodents considered to be among the rarest in the world, with the few species known to exist only spotted a handful of times by scientists.

Text: A forensic expert, three police officers and a music impresario have been jailed for covering up the 2015 murder of Venezuelan rapper Canserbero.
Canserbero, who had been named best Spanish-language rapper by Rolling Stone magazine, was drugged and stabbed to death by his manager, Natalia Améstica.
Améstica and her brother then threw his body from a 10th floor window.
The five people sentenced on Tuesday have been found guilty of helping the siblings stage the crime scene so Canserbero's murder appeared a suicide.
They have been given jail terms ranging between 15 and 20 years.
Natalia Améstica and her brother Guillermo were already sentenced to 25 years in prison back in February for murder.
The death on 19 January 2015 of Canserbero, whose real name was Tirone González, shocked the Venezuelan rap scene.
It was ruled at the time that the 26-year-old star had killed his friend Carlos Molnar in a knife fight before jumping from a window.
But in December 2023, Natalia Améstica confessed to stabbing both Molnar and Canserbero.
In a video statement released by the Venezuelan attorney general last year she recounted what had happened on the night.
Natalia Améstica claims that she was angry with the rapper after she had learned that Canserbero no longer wanted her as his manager.
She described how Canserbero came to her apartment in the Venezuelan city of Maracay on 19 January 2015.
He was accompanied by his friend Carlos Molnar, who was also Natalia Améstica's long-term boyfriend.
"The chance arose to make them a tea," she explained in the video, adding that she spiked their beverage with a powerful tranquiliser.
When her drugged partner Carlos Molnar entered the kitchen, she stabbed him in the neck, in the back and in the arm.
Canserbero witnessed Améstica's attack on her boyfriend but, under the influence of the drugs Améstica had slipped him, he collapsed on the sofa.
Améstica then proceeded to stab him twice.
"In desperation, I then called my brother Guillermo to help me resolve the situation," she said in the video confession.
Her brother arrived with the three officers from Venezuela's intelligence agency, Sebin, who have now been sentenced.
"They finished arranging the scene in a way to make it look like a murder-suicide," according to Natalia Améstica.
She said that the officers "stabbed Carlos [Molnar] a few more times, my brother Guillermo stabbed him four times. The rest, the Sebin officials did".
"Then we were told how to throw him out of the window to complete the murder-suicide scene," she said in her confession.
Her brother Guillermo said that a forensic detective who arrived at the scene became suspicious, remarking that it appeared "manipulated".
According to Guillermo Améstica, the forensic expert asked for a bribe of $10,000 (£7,880) in exchange for helping the siblings cover up the crime and to make it look like Canserbero had attacked Molnar before jumping out of the window.
The fifth man sentenced on Tuesday is Marcos Pratolongo, a music impresario who provided security at some of Canserbero's concerts.
At the time of his arrest, Venezuela's attorney general had said that Pratolongo was in possession of the keys to Canserbero's apartment, from which important evidence had disappeared.
The attorney general posted on social media on Tuesday that Pratolongo had been found guilty of complicity in Canserbero's murder but did not provide further details of his role in the crime.

Text: The founder of the feared Los Zetas drugs cartel has been deported to Mexico after serving a lengthy jail sentence in the United States.
Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, 57, led Los Zetas until 2003, when he was cornered by Mexican soldiers near his hometown of Matamoros.
Under his leadership, the group became one of the most powerful and brutal hit squads in the Mexican drug wars.
US immigration officials handed Cárdenas over to Mexican police at the Otay border crossing, where he was quickly re-arrested and taken to El Altiplano maximum security jail in Mexico state.
Mexican prosecutors said he had been arrested on charges of murder and organised crime dating back to his time as one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico.
Cárdenas Guillén made his criminal career in the Gulf drugs cartel in the 1990s, reportedly not shying away from having his allies killed to rise to the top, a practice which earned him the nickname of "Mata Amigos" (Spanish for "killer of friends").
But what he became infamous for was recruiting members of Mexico's elite special forces and using them as hitmen and enforcers for the Gulf cartel.
The law enforcers-turned-contract killers became known as Los Zetas.
The brutal methods they used, such as decapitating and dismembering their victims, quickly spread terror through the north-eastern part of Mexico which was their stronghold.
By the early 2000s, Cárdenas Guillén was one of the most wanted men in Mexico.
Mexican security forces managed to apprehend him in his home state of Tamaulipas in 2003 after a bloody gun battle.
Aware of the power the gang leader wielded in the area, the security forces quickly flew him to the capital, Mexico City, were he was put into pre-trial detention.
In 2007, he was extradited to the US.
There, he was charged not just with trafficking tonnes of cocaine into the US but also with threatening to assault and murder federal agents.
He pleaded guilty in 2010 and was sentenced to 25 years in jail.
Having served a large part of his sentence, he was released in August of 2024 from federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
This paved the way for his deportation to Mexico on Monday.
Mexican prosecutors said there were seven federal cases still open against Cárdenas Guillén and that he could be sentenced to a total of more than 700 years in prison if found guilty on all charges.

Headline: Brazil's Lula says he's well after brain bleed surgery

Text: Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been discharged from hospital after undergoing emergency surgery for a brain bleed, doctors said.
The 79-year-old appeared alongside his medical team at a news conference at Sírio-Libanês hospital in São Paulo.
"This here is not an interview, this is simply a session to say thanks. To thank, firstly, God, who has looked after me in a very generous manner," he said.
Lula was taken to hospital on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache.
Doctors performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced.
The brain bleed, or intracranial haemorrhage, was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement.
"Thank you very much for the prayers," Lula added on Sunday. "And for those who only have hate, you're forgiven. I am here, alive, whole, and with more desire to work."
On Tuesday, doctors said the president was in a stable condition following the surgery and was conscious.
Lula was "lucid" and conversing with medical staff, they added.
They also insisted that he had not sustained any brain injury and was not experiencing after-effects from the surgery.
Asked when he would return to the capital, doctors had said that if everything went well, they expected Lula to be back in Brasilia "next week".
While Lula was in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin took on some of the president's commitments.
The doctors said the bleeding was a result of the fall Lula had sustained in October.
They explained that it was not unusual for problems from a blow to the head to appear "months later".
Lula had slipped in the bathroom in the Alvorada Palace on 19 October and hit the back of his head. On Sunday, he explained he had been cutting his toe nails at the time and had been sitting down.
He went on to have five stitches. On his doctors' advice, the president cancelled his planned trip to Russia for a summit of the Brics countries.
He returned to full duties days later.
Lula has been in power since January last year after narrowly beating the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in a bitterly fought election.
During the election campaign, he often joked that he had "the energy of a 30-year-old".

Headline: Milei, Musk and Maga: Is Argentina influencing the US?
Author: Robert Plummer, BBC News
Published Date: 2024-12-13T22:33:31.861Z
Text: As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.
Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.
Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.
That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can "make Argentina great again".
Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is "experiencing a giant improvement" under his leadership.
But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?
Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.
In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.
Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.
All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.
Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.
Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing "a fantastic job" in Argentina by "deleting entire departments" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.
But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.
Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that "taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense".
"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US."
Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was "bursting into crisis every few years".
"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else."
Marcelo J García, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a "masterpiece" of political marketing that has "captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe".
But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.
"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government," he told the BBC.
He points out that Trump's policies "require big government in some areas", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. "You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government."
In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.
Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the "woke agenda". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.
Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur "has ended up becoming a prison".
"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.
Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.
Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.
He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.
Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: "You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise."
The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.
As Marcelo J García sees it, Milei is a "divisive leader" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.
"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him," he says.
"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei," he adds.
In his view, this is a real weakness: "You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you."
Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam.

Text: Gunmen in Mexico have shot dead a judge outside a courthouse in the city of Acapulco.
Judge Edmundo Román Pinzón was hit by at least four bullets as he was driving out of the courthouse car park on Wednesday afternoon, local time.
He was a senior judge who had been president of the highest court in the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located.
The murder comes amid a surge in deadly attacks on officials in the violence-wracked southern state.
Police have been speaking to witnesses and been gathering CCTV footage from the murder scene, but so far no arrests have been made in connection with the case.
The security forces have also stepped up their activities in the resort town in order to catch those responsible.
According to local paper El Sol de Acapulco, the judge had been in charge of the court which dealt with murders, kidnappings and car thefts.
It is not yet known what the possible motive behind the murder may have been.
The governor of Guerrero state said the crime demanded "immediate justice".
The killing of the judge is the latest in a string of extremely violent attacks in Guerrero over the past weeks.
Last month, the bodies of 11 people, including two children, were found inside a vehicle in the town of Chilpancingo, 100km (62 miles) north of Acapulco.
Acapulco, once a popular beach resort, has not been spared, with rival gangs battling for control of the city's drugs market - and at times leaving mutilated bodies on beaches.

Headline: Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift
Author: Catherine Ellis, Business reporter, Reporting fromBogotá, Colombia
Published Date: 2024-12-12T00:03:09.664Z
Text: We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?
While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.
That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.
This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.
So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernabéu Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?
Born in the Colombian city of Medellín in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.
Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.
While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.
She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.
Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Mañana Será Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.
Karol G's style of music is more often described as "reggaeton". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.
While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Rocío Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer – and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.
"Streaming democratised the landscape," says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.
"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution."
Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.
Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (£1.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.
And this year, Karol's G's Mañana Será Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.
This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Mañana Será Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.
Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.
"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts," he adds.
Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Español at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.
"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do," she says. "And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.
"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented," adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.
Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs "Bichota". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.
She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.
Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.
Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.
Ms Cobo says: "She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music."
Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.
This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.
Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.
Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.
However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. "It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time," she says.

Text: The number of cases of dengue fever in Central and South America has nearly tripled to a record high this year, the Pan American Health Organisation (Paho) said on Tuesday.
More than 12.6m cases and 7,700 deaths were recorded in what Paho says is the biggest outbreak in the region since records began in 1980.
Brazil, Argentina, Colombia in South America and Mexico in North America were hit especially hard by the virus, accounting for the majority of cases and deaths.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause serious illness or death in some cases.
Symptoms include a fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and a blotchy rash.
Those with a more severe type of dengue might experience severe stomach pain, fatigue, vomiting, and blood in vomit or stool.
Vaccines have been introduced in some countries in the region, while others, such as Honduras, plan to start distribution in 2025.
In a statement, Paho urged for stronger mitigation efforts and collaboration across the Americas.
Its director, Dr Jarbas Barbosa, said the high number of cases was linked to a hotter, wetter climate and factors such as accumulated water around the home and poor waste management, which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
He also said the virus was posing a "higher-than-normal" risk to children.
In Guatemala, 70% of dengue-related deaths were children, while in Mexico, Costa Rica and Paraguay, under-15s made up more than a third of severe cases, Paho data showed.
Children and people with pre-existing health conditions are more likely to catch the disease and develop more serious symptoms.
Around half the world's population live in areas with a risk of contracting the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito, most commonly the Aedes aegypti.

Headline: Haiti gang kills 110 people accused of witchcraft

Text: At least 110 mostly elderly people have been brutally murdered by gang members in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, according to a human rights group.
The National Human Rights Defence Network (RNDDH) said a local gang leader had targeted them after his son fell ill and subsequently died.
The gang leader reportedly consulted a voodoo priest who blamed elderly locals practising "witchcraft" for the boy's mystery illness.
The United Nations said the number of people killed in Haiti so far this year in spiralling gang violence had reached "a staggering 5,000".
Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting
While details from the massacre are still emerging, the UN's human rights chief Volker Türk on Monday put the number of people killed over the weekend "in violence orchestrated by the leader of a powerful gang" at 184.
The killings happened in the Cité Soleil neighbourhood of the capital.
According to reports, gang members seized scores of residents aged over 60 from their homes in the Wharf Jérémie area, rounded them up and then shot or stabbed them to death with knives and machetes.
Residents reported seeing mutilated bodies being burned in the streets.
RNDDH estimated 60 were killed on Friday while another 50 were rounded up and murdered on Saturday, after the gang leader's son had died of his illness.
While RNDDH said that all the victims were over 60, another rights group said some younger people who had tried to protect the elderly had also been killed.
Local media said that elderly people believed to be practitioners of voodoo had been singled out because the gang leader had been told his son's illness had been caused by them.
Rights groups said the man who had ordered the killings was Monel Felix, also known as Mikano.
Mikano is known to control Wharf Jérémie, a strategic area in the port of the capital.
According to Romain Le Cour Grandmaison, a Haiti expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Crime (GI-TOC), the area is small but hard for the security forces to penetrate.
Local media said that residents had been prevented from leaving Wharf Jérémie by Mikano's gang, so news of the deadly killings was slow to spread.
The group forms part of the Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which controls much of the Haitian capital.
Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse.
Data gathered by GI-TOC shows there was a decline in the murder rate between May and September of this year, after rival gangs had reached an uneasy truce.
But attempts by the gangs to expand their territory beyond their strongholds in the capital have led to particularly bloody incidents in the past two months, with ordinary residents rather than rival gang members being increasingly targeted.
On 3 October, 115 locals were killed in the small town of Pont-Sondé in the Artibonite department.
That massacre was reportedly carried out by the Gran Grif gang in retaliation for some residents joining a vigilante group to resist attempts by Gran Grif to extort locals.
If confirmed, the death toll given by the UN for this weekend's killings in Cité Soleil, would make it the deadliest incident so far this year.
With gangs in control of an estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince and increasingly large swathes of the countryside, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been forced to flee their homes.
According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 700,000 people - half of them children - are internally displaced across the country.
Gang members often use sexual abuse, including gang rape, to sow terror among the local population.
In a report published two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch researcher Nathalye Cotrino wrote that "the rule of law in Haiti is so broken that members of criminal groups rape girls or women without fearing any consequences".
Attempts by the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support Mission to quell the violence have so far failed.
The international police force arrived in Haiti in June to bolster the Haitian National Police but is underfunded and lacks the necessary equipment to take on the heavily armed gangs.
Meanwhile, the Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) - the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order - appears to be in turmoil.
The TPC replaced the interim prime minister last month and seems to have made little progress towards organising elections.
"They reign over a mountain of ashes," GI-TOC's Romain Le Cour Grandmaison writes of the council in his report.

Headline: Dominican Republic records largest cocaine seizure

Text: Authorities in the Dominican Republican say cocaine discovered in the country's largest-ever seizure was headed to Europe.
Hidden in a banana shipment, officials found 9,500kg of the drug at a port in the capital, Santo Domingo.
The cocaine was hidden in 320 bags with an estimated street value of $250 million (£196 million).
At least 10 people linked to the port are under investigation with early investigations showing the bananas had arrived from Guatemala, according to the National Drug Control Directorate.
Communications chief Carlos Denvers said: "Many unknown individuals tried to transfer the drugs to another container that would be shipped on a vessel to Belgium."
The haul far exceeds the 2,580kg seizure made by Dominican authorities at the same port in 2006.
Monitoring agencies have reported that the Caribbean is resurfacing as a major drug trafficking route from Colombia to Europe.
A report last year found the use of cocaine is increasing in several western European countries including the UK, Belgium, France and Spain.
Europe accounted for 21% of the world's cocaine users in 2020, according to a United Nations report.
Evidence suggests use of the drug is bringing dire health consequences, with recent data showing drug-poisoning deaths in England and Wales hit the highest level in 30 years, fuelled by a 30% rise in fatalities involving cocaine.

Text: The number of people who have been reported missing in the violence-wracked Mexican state of Sinaloa has doubled since two rival factions of a drugs cartel started a bloody battle for control of their criminal organisation.
According to official figures, more than 200 people have disappeared since the two factions of the Sinaloa cartel declared war on each other almost three months ago.
The feud broke out after the arrest in the US of Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada.
His followers, known as "Los Mayos" or "La Mayiza", say he was betrayed by the son of the infamous founder of the Sinaloa cartel, Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, and have turned on members of his faction, known as "Los Chapitos".
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has despatched her security chief, Omar García Harfuch, to Sinaloa state to quell the violence.
The spike in murders and disappearances in Sinaloa has overshadowed Sheinbaum's first months in office.
She was sworn in as Mexico's first female head of state on 1 October after a campaign in which she had promised to maintain the approach taken by her predecessor in office, who avoided direct confrontations with the cartels.
"There will be no return to the irresponsible drug war," she had said in her inaugural speech, ruling out a more militaristic approach.
But faced with growing criticism in her own country and pressure from US President-elect Donald Trump, who wants Mexico to do more to curb the trafficking to the US of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, Sheinbaum on Wednesday appeared to make tackling the violence in Sinaloa her priority.
In a news conference, she said her Administration would take a "zero tolerance" approach.
She also praised the security forces for making Mexico's biggest fentanyl bust to date.
"This is an investigation that has been going on for a long time and yesterday, it gave these results. It is the largest seizure of fentanyl pills ever made," she said.
Earlier, Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, had announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the fentanyl pills seized at two properties in Sinaloa were worth $394m (£309m) and weighed more than a tonne.
"These actions will continue until the violence diminishes in the state of Sinaloa," he said in the post [in Spanish].
News of the massive fentanyl bust came just over a week after Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada on day one of his presidency.
He said the tariffs would remain in place until "until such time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country".
Mexican officials also announced on Wednesday that they had detained more than 5,200 migrants across the country the previous day, in what appeared to be a response to President Sheinbaum's promise to Trump to stop a migrant caravan moving north through Mexico from reaching the US border.

Text: A parliamentary session in the Bahamas has been dramatically suspended after an opposition MP threw a ceremonial mace out a window.
Shanendon Cartwright, the deputy leader of the opposition, was restrained by police and officials following the incident.
During the scuffle the deputy speaker was struck and taken to hospital, while a police officer suffered a leg injury, Speaker Patricia Deveaux told parliament.
Local media said the melee was sparked when Ms Deveaux refused to allow Opposition Leader Michael Pintard to address allegations in a US indictment accusing federal police of involvement in drug trafficking.
Throwing a mace out a window has historic significance in the country.
In 1965, the leader of the opposition did the same thing in a push for electoral change, in an event dubbed "Black Tuesday".

Headline: Selling sex for gold in the Amazon's illegal mines

Text: Dayane Leite never wanted to become a sex worker but at the age of 17 her husband died of a heart attack and she couldn’t pay for the funeral.
Her home town, Itaituba in Brazil’s northern Para state, is at the heart of the country’s illegal gold-mining trade, so a friend suggested raising the money by having sex with miners, deep in the Amazon.
“Going to the mines is a roll of the dice,” she says.
“The women are seriously humiliated there. They may be slapped in the face and yelled at.
“I was sleeping in my bedroom and a guy jumped through the window and put a gun to my head. And if they pay, they want to own the women.”
Dayane successfully gathered the money for the funeral, and at the age of 18 she had her first child. For the last 16 years, like many women in Itaituba, she has been returning periodically to the mines to work as a cook, a washerwoman, a barmaid and a sex worker.
She now has a family of seven to support.
“I'm not going to say that all the women in the city do it, but a fair share of them do sex work. So it’s kind of normal. We don’t really care,” says Natalia Cavalcante, who became a sex worker in a remote mining settlement at 24. Four years later, after marrying the owner of a bar, she became the madam of a brothel – a job she only gave up recently, to look after her nieces in the city.
Life in mining villages in the rainforest is harsh - most consist of just a dirt track, saloon bars and a church. But the miners themselves live even further out, in shacks made of wood and canvas, surrounded by snakes and jaguars, and in total darkness once the generator is switched off. Women working as cooks have to live in these camps, alongside the men.
The miners appear in the village whenever they have found gold and have money to spend, Natalia adds. Sometimes they have to be persuaded to have a shower before sex, women say.
Running a brothel is illegal under Brazilian law, but Natalia says she took no commission, she just employed bar staff and rented out rooms.
Young women would contact her asking for work, and she sometimes lent them money for the journey, a seven-hour drive from Itaituba.
Asked whether she had misgivings about involving other women in the work, she replied: “Sometimes I think: ‘I’ve been through that, and I know it’s not that nice.’ But then I think: ‘The girl has a family, sometimes a child to raise. Many of the girls who go have one or two children.’ So we accept it.”
Even before marrying, Natalia had made a lot of money.
She now has her own house in Itaituba, a motorbike, and considerable quantities of gold that she sometimes received as payment for sex, two or three grams at a time. Her goal is to study, to become a lawyer or an architect.
Some women in Itaituba, nicknamed Gold Nugget City, have set themselves up in business with the money they made, she says.
But it’s a big risk to venture as a woman into the violent and lawless mining settlements.
While the environmental harm of the mines is well known, the human cost - which the UN says includes violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking - goes largely unreported.
A dealer in precious metals told the BBC that the illegal gold from these mines would typically be relabelled as gold from a licensed mining co-operative, before being exported and turned into jewellery and components for mobile phones, or other electronic goods.
The three largest customers of Brazilian gold are Canada, Switzerland and the UK. More than 90% of all exports to Europe are from areas where illegal mining occurs, according to the Instituto Escolhas think tank.
It’s not unknown for women to be murdered in mining villages. The dead body of 26-year-old Raiele Santos was found last year in the room where she had been living near the Cuiú-Cuiú gold mine, 11 hours’ drive from Itaituba.
Her elder sister, Railane, says a man had offered her money for sex and she had refused, so he found her later and beat her to death.
“A lot of women die on a daily basis, a lot of women,” Railane says.
“I was born in the mines, I grew up in the mines, and now I'm afraid to live in the mines.”
A man has been arrested in connection with Raiele’s murder, but has not yet been tried. He denies all the charges against him.
The land covered by Brazil’s illegal gold mines more than doubled in the 10 years to 2023, to 220,000 hectares – an area larger than Greater London. No-one knows how many women work in this area, or even how many illegal miners there are. The Brazilian government says the latter figure could be anywhere from 80,000 to 800,000.
Under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the government has taken steps to close illegal mines and to stop dealers buying the gold they produce, but high gold prices continue to drive many men to try their luck.
Dayane wants to stop working in the mining areas because of the risks and the toll the hardship takes on her body, but she is planning what she hopes will be one last trip. Her goal is to earn enough in two or three months to open a snack bar on her return, though she realises she may not succeed.
Whenever she is alone, walking in the forest, she will worry about her children, she says.
“I will keep trying, until I can’t any more,” she says. “Because I think that one day, my children will say: ‘My mum worked so hard. She went through what she went through for us, and she never gave up.’”

Headline: UN orders Venezuela not to destroy election vote tallies

Text: The United Nations' Human Rights Committee has ordered Venezuela "to refrain from destroying" the voting tallies from July's presidential election.
The voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election.
The government-aligned National Electoral Council (CNE) declared the incumbent, President Nicolás Maduro, the winner but failed to provide the voting tallies to back up its claim.
The opposition, which with the help of accredited election witnesses collected and published more than 80% of the voting tallies, says these prove that its candidate, Edmundo González, was the overwhelming winner.
The Human Rights Committee - a UN body made up of 18 independent experts - said it was investigating allegations of electoral fraud following a complaint brought by a law firm on behalf of a Venezuelan voter.
As part of that investigation, the committee demanded that the Venezuelan state preserve the detailed voting data from the presidential election on 28 July.
There has been huge pressure on the CNE - which is stacked with government loyalists - to release the voting tallies.
But more than four months on from the election, it still has not done so, blaming an alleged computer hack on election night for its unprecedented failure to provide the data within 30 days of the election date.
In contrast, the opposition quickly uploaded the voting tallies it had gathered onto a website.
Independent observers and media, including the New York Times and CNN, say those tallies suggest that Edmundo González won the election with 67% of the votes compared to Maduro's 30%.
But Nicolás Maduro has dismissed the tallies published by the opposition as "fraudulent" and maintains that he is the election winner.
He is ploughing ahead with preparations for 10 January, when he says he will be sworn in to his third consecutive term in office.
This has pitted him against a growing number of countries, including the United States, Italy, Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Uruguay, which have recognised González as the president-elect of Venezuela.
IHR Legal, the international law firm which brought the complaint before the UN Human Rights Committee, said the case was "pioneering" and "historic" and could lead to the committee "confirming that Nicolás Maduro is not the president-elect of Venezuela".

Headline: Mexico leader responds to Trump claim she agreed to stop migration

Text: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has sought to clarify details of a conversation she had with US President-elect Donald Trump, after the two leaders offered differing accounts of the call.
Following Wednesday's call, Trump said Sheinbaum had "agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border".
This prompted Sheinbaum to say she had merely reiterated Mexico's position, which she said was "not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and people".
The call followed Trump's announcement on Monday that, upon taking office in January, he would slap an across-the-board tariff of 25% on Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on China.
He said the import duties on Mexico and Canada would only be removed once illegal immigration and drug trafficking to the US had stopped.
The announcement was initially met with combative language from President Sheinbaum, who vowed earlier on Wednesday to retaliate if the US triggered a trade war.
"If there are US tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs," she said of the proposed duties, which appear to breach the USMCA trade deal that Trump himself struck in 2018 during his first presidency between the US, Mexico and Canada.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Mexican president said she did not specifically discuss tariffs in the phone call with Trump but that they had addressed immigration and fentanyl trafficking - the reasons Trump had named for imposing the tariffs in the first place.
She said she had reassured him that a migrant caravan he had expressed concern about was "not going to reach the [northern] Mexican frontier" with the US but she stressed that "it has never been our plan to close the border with the US".
Sheinbaum insisted that the conversation had been "very amiable" and that they had agreed they would "continue with our talks".
In what appeared an altogether more conciliatory tone compared to her initial reaction to Trump's import tax announcement, she also insisted there was now "no possibility of a tariff war" between Mexico and the US.
The flow of migrants from Mexico in the US has long overshadowed relations between the two neighbours and became a defining issue in the 2024 White House election race that culminated in Trump’s resounding victory this month.
Under US diplomatic pressure, Mexico has been conducting its largest ever migrant crackdown, bussing and flying non-Mexican migrants to the country’s south, far from the US border.
But Trump campaigned on a promise to seal the US-Mexico border and his threat to impose 25% tariffs was seen as an attempt to force Mexico into doing more to stop the migrants from reaching the US southern border.
The Mexican government has in turn demanded that the US take action to stop the flow of weapons being smuggled from the US into Mexico.
Sheinbaum told reporters on Thursday that she would raise the issue of guns with Trump "in due time".
Earlier this week Trump spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
On Wednesday night, Trudeau held an emergency meeting with the leaders of the country's provinces and territories to discuss the tariff threat.
According to a summary of the call, they were urged to "make use of all of their contacts, channels, and abilities to relay important information and messages to Americans and people of influence" about the deep economic and security ties between the US and Canada.

Text: Uruguay has traditionally been more affluent than other countries in South America, and is known for its advanced education and social security systems and liberal social laws.
It was the first nation in Latin America to establish a welfare state, maintained through relatively high taxes on industry, and developed a democratic tradition that earned it the sobriquet "the Switzerland of South America".
But economic and political turmoil, in particular left-wing urban guerrilla attacks in the early 1970s, led the government of the day to suspend the constitution and launch a period of repressive military rule that lasted until 1985.
Since the restoration of democratic government, successive governments have liberalised the economy. Colonial towns, beach resorts and a year-round mild climate have contributed to a growing tourist industry.

President-elect: Yamandú Orsi
Centre-left Yamandú Orsi was elected president after winning the second-round runoff in November 2024, beating Álvaro Delgado, the candidate of the governing conservative coalition.
Orsi struck a business-friendly note in his campaign, saying that he planned to avoid raising taxes that could scare off investors.
After his victory, he stressed he wanted to be a president for all Uruguayans, saying he would "call for a national dialogue again and again" and that he would listen to those who had voted for his rival.
"I'm going to be the president who builds a more integrated country, where we set aside our differences and nobody is left behind, neither economically, socially or politically."
Uruguay's election - which pitted two moderates against each other - bucked the trend seen in other countries in the Western Hemisphere, such as Argentina, Brazil and the US, where deep divisions came to the fore.
Uruguayans can access a wide range of views via hundreds of privately-owned media outlets.
The state of media freedom is healthy and Uruguay has been praised for setting up an independent broadcasting regulator.

Text: A left-wing former history teacher, Yamandú Orsi, has won the presidential election in Uruguay.
Orsi beat Álvaro Delgado, the candidate for the governing conservative coalition, by more than three percentage points in Sunday's run-off.
Delgado conceded defeat and congratulated Orsi and his Broad Front coalition, which will now return to power after five years of conservative rule.
The Broad Front governed Uruguay for 15 years from 2005 to 2020 before being beaten by outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou - who under Uruguay's constitution was barred from standing for a second consecutive term in this election.
Orsi, 57, is seen as a protege of former President José Mujica, who won the hearts of many in Uruguay through his modest lifestyle, prompting many to label him "the world's poorest president".
Orsi himself comes from a humble background, having grown up in rural Uruguay in a house without electricity.
While working as a school history teacher, he became active in local politics, eventually becoming mayor of Canelones, Uruguay's second-most populous department.
During Orsi's time at the helm in Canelones, tech giant Google announced it would build a huge data centre in the department.
Orsi struck a business-friendly note in his campaign, saying that he planned to avoid raising taxes that could scare off investors.
Addressing his supporters on Sunday evening, he stressed he wanted to be a president for all 3.4 million Uruguayans, saying he would "call for a national dialogue again and again" and that he would listen to those who had voted for his rival.
"I'm going to be the president who builds a more integrated country, where we set aside our differences and nobody is left behind, neither economically, socially or politically."
Outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou said he would work with Orsi to ensure a smooth transition ahead of the swearing-in of the new president on 1 March next year.
Orsi's Broad Front also won a majority in the Uruguyan Senate, but his coalition did not clinch a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
Uruguay's election - which pitted two moderates against each other - has bucked the trend seen in other countries in the Western Hemisphere, such as Argentina, Brazil and the US, where deep divisions came to the fore.

Headline: Brazil police formally accuse Bolsonaro of alleged coup plot

Text: Ex-Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and some of his closest allies have been formally accused of allegedly plotting a coup, after he lost the 2022 presidential election.
Bolsonaro's vice-presidential candidate Walter Braga Netto and 35 other people have also been indicted by federal police for attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, coup d'état and criminal organisation.
It comes after a nearly two-year-long investigation into whether Bolsonaro incited a failed coup after claiming the election was fraudulent.
In a post on X, Bolsonaro said he would mount a legal "fight" against the claims, and accused investigators of being "creative" and doing "everything that the law does not say".
In a statement, police said their probe "found the existence of a criminal organisation that acted in a coordinated manner, in 2022, in an attempt to keep the then president of the republic in power".
Police have forwarded the report with the indictment of the 37 people to the court.
The country's top prosecutor will now decide whether to press charges.
Among those accused of being part of a criminal conspiracy to stage a coup are Bolsonaro's former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem, as well as former ministers Anderson Torres and Augusto Heleno.
The indictment is a fresh blow for Bolsonaro's hard-right backers, who had hoped to overturn a ban blocking him from office in time to him to run for president in 2026.
Earlier this week, federal police in Brazil arrested five people who are suspected of plotting to kill then president-elect Lula in the days before he took office.
In the last few months, federal police have also formally accused Bolsonaro of tampering with his Covid-19 vaccination cards while in office and of benefiting from an illegal scheme to sell jewellery gifted to his government by Saudi Arabia.
Bolsonaro was banned from running for office for eight years after being accused of undermining Brazilian democracy by falsely claiming that electronic ballots used in the October 2022 poll were vulnerable to hacking and fraud.
The bitterly fought election was won by an extremely narrow margin by left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Mr Bolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat and left Brazil for the US two days before Lula was sworn in as president.
His supporters, who refused to accept the outcome of the election, stormed Brazil's Congress, the presidential palace and the building housing the Supreme Court on 8 January 2023.
Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 of the rioters.
In his X post, Bolsonaro added that he would wait to see what was in the indictment.
"I will wait for the lawyer. This, obviously, will go to the attorney general's office. It is at the PGR [Prosecutor General of the Republic] that the fight begins," he added.

Text: The humanitarian medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has suspended its operations in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, following a violent attack on its staff and the alleged killing of two patients they were treating by Haitian police officers.
The incident took place last week as violence continued to worsen in the country.
An estimated 25 people were killed in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday alone in what police say was a foiled attempt at a gang invasion of a wealthy neighbourhood.
Politically, the situation also remains critical with interim Prime Minister Garry Conille fired this month by the country's ruling council - less than six months after he took office.
MSF says that on 11 November one of its ambulances carrying three young men with gunshot wounds was stopped by Haitian law enforcement officers.
Apparently supported by a paramilitary self-defence group, the men attacked the vehicle, removed two of the patients, took them outside hospital grounds and executed them.
The humanitarian group denounced the violence in a strongly worded statement last week, saying their personnel had been tear-gassed and held against their will for several hours.
While that incident appears to have been the final straw for MSF in Port-au-Prince, at least for the time being, it was not the only recent example of extreme aggression against their staff.
The announcement comes amid a worsening climate of violence in Haiti with some 25 suspected gang members killed in the capital on Tuesday.
The police say that residents helped officers to fight off an attempted attack on the upscale suburb of Pétion-Ville.
The neighbourhood was cordoned off after residents barricaded streets, some armed with machetes and makeshift weapons, in an apparent effort to prevent a gang invasion.

Headline: Brazil arrests soldiers over 'plot to kill' President Lula in 2022

Text: Police in Brazil have arrested five people suspected of planning to kill Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva shortly before he was sworn in as president.
Four of those detained on Tuesday are soldiers and one is a police officer, local media reported.
The five were allegedly part of a plot to kill President-elect Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, on 15 December 2022, just over two weeks before the presidential inauguration.
Lula was elected in October 2022, narrowly defeating incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who never publicly accepted defeat.
A week after Lula was sworn in, Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace and vandalised the buildings.
Police eventually cleared the buildings of the rioters and detained thousands.
Investigations into the events of 8 January 2023 as well as previous alleged attempts to prevent Lula from being sworn in have been under way since.
However, this is the first time that police have revealed an alleged attempt to assassinate Lula.
Speaking after news of the arrests broke, Social Communications Minister Paulo Pimenta said that the alleged plot to assassinate Lula and Alckmin had almost gone ahead.
"It was just details which stopped it [from being carried out]," the minister said.
Brazilian news site G1 said that what was particularly worrying was that four of those arrested were active members of the military and the fifth a serving member of the police force.
AFP news agency quoted a federal police source as saying that the four soldiers "were arrested in Rio, where they were participating in the security operation for the G20 leaders' meeting" currently under way in the Brazilian city.
According to G1, the four soldiers, who had had special forces training, are accused of forming part of a criminal organisation plotting against Lula.
Brazil's federal police said in a statement that its investigations "indicate that the criminal organisation used a high level of technical-military knowledge to plan, coordinate and execute illicit actions in the months of November and December 2022".
According to the statement, the plotters had not just planned to assassinate the president-elect and the vice-president-elect but also wanted to arrest and execute a member of the Supreme Court once their coup was successful.
Police said the plotters had nicknamed the operation "green and yellow dagger", in reference to the colours of the Brazilian flag.
According to the federal police, the plotters had debated how to best "neutralise" Lula and Geraldo Alckmin and had allegedly settled on poisoning the president-elect.
The arrests were carried out in the early hours of Tuesday morning local time and were authorised by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.

Text: Torrential rain caused by Tropical Storm Sara has cut off more than 1,700 communities in Honduras.
The slow-moving storm caused widespread flooding across the Central American nation.
So far, Honduran officials have confirmed only one death but said that more than 110,000 people had been affected by the storm.
Forecasters say Sara is likely to further weaken on Monday as it moves over the southern Mexican state of Quintana Roo.
Sara formed in the Caribbean Sea on Thursday.
The tropical storm was extremely slow moving, dumping huge amounts of rain on northern Honduras for four days running before moving north to Belize and Mexico.
Some areas saw 500mm (19.7 inches) of rain fall causing rivers to swell.
Nine bridges were destroyed by fast flowing waters and another 19 damaged, Honduran emergency services said.
Several highways also became impassable following landslides.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro had warned citizens living near rivers as early as Thursday to take shelter elsewhere and thousands heeded her call.
More than 2,500 homes were damaged and more than 200 destroyed, officials said.
Sara is the 18th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the third this month.
Less than two weeks ago, Hurricane Rafael caused a nationwide blackout when it hit Cuba.
Meteorologists say the storms have been fuelled by high sea surface temperatures.
While hurricanes and tropical storms occur naturally, human-caused climate change is supercharging them and exacerbating the risk of major damage,” Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, has warned.

Headline: European leaders back 'realistic' Arab plan for Gaza
Author: Lucy Clarke-Billings, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-03-08T18:46:17.626Z
Text: Leading European nations have said they support an Arab-backed plan for the reconstruction of Gaza that would cost $53 billion (£41 billion) and avoid displacing Palestinians from the territory.
The plan, drawn up by Egypt and endorsed by Arab leaders, has been rejected by Israel and by US President Donald Trump, who presented his own vision to turn the Gaza Strip into a "Middle East Riviera".
On Saturday the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Britain welcomed the plan, which calls for Gaza to be rebuilt over five years, as "realistic".
In a statement, they said the proposal promised "swift and sustainable improvement of the catastrophic living conditions" for the people of Gaza.
The plan calls for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed to the territory.
The committee would be responsible for overseeing humanitarian aid and temporarily managing Gaza's affairs under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority.
The proposal is an alternative to Trump's idea for the US to take over Gaza and resettle its population.
It was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas after it was presented by Egypt at an emergency Arab League summit on Tuesday.
But both the White House and Israeli foreign ministry said it failed to address realities in Gaza.
"Residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance," Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump's National Security Council, said late on Tuesday.
"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas," the statement added.
The statement issued by the four European countries on Saturday said they were "committed to working with the Arab initiative" and they appreciated the "important signal" the Arab states had sent by developing it.
The statement said Hamas "must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel any more" and that the four countries "support the central role for the Palestinian Authority and the implementation of its reform agenda".
The proposal was drawn up amid growing concern that Gaza's fragile ceasefire deal could collapse after the six-week first phase expired on 1 March.
Israel has blocked aid from entering the territory to pressure Hamas to accept a new US proposal for a temporary extension of the truce, during which more hostages held in Gaza would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
Hamas has insisted the second phase should begin as agreed, leading to an end of the war and a full Israeli troop withdrawal.
Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes since the start of hostilities. Israel began military operations after Hamas's October 2023 attack which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage.
Gaza has suffered vast destruction with a huge humanitarian impact. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and much infrastructure across the strip has been levelled by air strikes.

Headline: Syrian security forces accused of killing dozens of Alawites

Text: Syrian security forces are alleged to have executed dozens of people belonging to the Alawite minority in the coastal province of Latakia, according to a war monitoring group.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said 162 civilians have been killed in "field executions" in the region - a heartland of deposed president Bashir al-Assad, who also belongs to the Alawite sect.
An interior ministry source told the country's official news agency Sana that "individual violations" had occurred on the coast and pledged to put a stop to them.
BBC News has not been able to verify claims that the killings were committed by the forces of Syria's new rulers.
The total killed includes 13 women and five children, the SOHR told the AFP news agency.
Syria's new rulers, who ousted Assad in December, said a military operation is now being launched in the former president's home town of Qardaha.
In his first statement since the violence broke out, the country's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said Syria would pursue the "remnants" of the ousted Assad regime and bring them to trial, Reuters reports.
This follows clashes between government forces and fighters loyal to Assad, which left more than 70 dead.
A curfew has been imposed in the cities of Homs, Latakia and Tartous, where the fighting has broken out, and the governor of Latakia has said all power to the province has been cut.
Earlier, BBC Verify confirmed two videos that showed a body being dragged behind a car in Latakia.
The violence has left the Alawite community in "a state of horror", a Syrian activist in the city told BBC Newshour.
"They are feeling so fearful. They are in a state of shock," said the activist, who did not want to use his name for fear of reprisals.
"They don't know what to do. There is no government or state who is ready to help them, to protect them, " he added.
The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said in a statement he was "deeply concerned" by reports of the clashes and killings.
He called on all parties to "refrain from actions that could further inflame tensions, escalate conflict, exacerbate the suffering of affected communities, destabilize Syria, and jeopardize a credible and inclusive political transition."
The region is the heartland of the Alawite minority and a stronghold of the Assad family, which belongs to the sect.
Estimations of the number of people killed in the violence vary, and the BBC has been unable to independently verify them.
Residents say they have been targets of sectarian violence, with one Alawite woman telling BBC Arabic that many Syrians are "scared" regardless of if they were on the coast or in the capital.
She added that "everyone is terrified from the current incitement", and fears they will become "scapegoats".
Turkey and Russia have warned that the bloodshed, the worst since the toppling of Assad in December, threatens the stability of the entire region. Germany has urged Syria to avoid a "spiral of violence" after the clashes.
Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni.

Headline: Party drug MDMA may have protected survivors of Nova attack from trauma, study suggests
Author: Lucy Williamson, Middle East correspondent
Published Date: 2025-03-07T22:00:09.820Z
Text: As dawn approached on the morning of 7 October 2023, many of the partygoers at the Nova music festival near Gaza's border took illegal recreational drugs like MDMA or LSD.
Hundreds of them were high when, shortly after sunrise, Hamas gunmen attacked the site.
Now neuroscientists working with survivors from the festival say there are early signs that MDMA - also known as ecstasy or molly - may have provided some psychological protection against trauma.
The preliminary results, currently being peer-reviewed with a view to publication in the coming months, suggest that the drug is associated with more positive mental states - both during the event and in the months afterwards.
The study, carried out by scientists at Israel's Haifa University, could contribute to a growing scientific interest in how MDMA might be used to treat psychological trauma.
It is thought to be the first time scientists have been able to study a mass trauma event where large numbers of people were under the influence of mind-altering drugs.
Hamas gunmen killed 360 people and kidnapped dozens more at the festival site where 3,500 people had been partying.
"We had people hiding under the bodies of their friends for hours while on LSD or MDMA," said Prof Roy Salomon, one of those leading the research.
"There's talk that a lot of these substances create plasticity in the brain, so the brain is more open to change. But what happens if you endure this plasticity in such a terrible situation - is it going to be worse, or better?"
The research tracked the psychological responses of more than 650 survivors from the festival. Two-thirds of these were under the influence of recreational drugs including MDMA, LSD, marijuana or psilocybin - the compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms - before the attacks took place.
"MDMA, and especially MDMA that was not mixed with anything else, was the most protective," the study has found, according to Prof Salomon.
He said those on MDMA during the attack appeared to cope much better mentally in the first five months afterwards, when a lot of processing takes place.
"They were sleeping better, had less mental distress - they were doing better than people who didn't take any substance," he said.
The team believes pro-social hormones triggered by the drug - such as oxytocin, which helps promote bonding - helped reduce fear and boost feelings of camaraderie between those fleeing the attack.
And even more importantly, they say, it appears to have left survivors more open to receiving love and support from their families and friends once they were home.
Clearly, the research is limited only to those who survived the attacks, making it hard to determine with any certainty whether specific drugs helped or hindered victims' chances of escape.
But researchers found that many survivors, like Michal Ohana, firmly believe it did play a role - and say that belief, in itself, may help them to recover from the event.
"I feel like it saved my life, because I was so high, like I'm not in the real world," she told me. "Because regular humans can't see all these things - it's not normal."
Without the drug, she believes she would have just frozen or collapsed to the floor, and been killed or captured by the gunmen.
Clinicians in various countries have already experimented with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a trial setting - though only Australia has approved it as a treatment.
Countries that have rejected it include the US, where the Food and Drug Administration cited concerns about the design of the studies, that the treatment may not offer long-lasting benefits, and about the potential risk for heart problems, injury and abuse.
MDMA is classified as a Class A drug in the UK, and has been linked to liver, kidney and heart problems.
In Israel, where MDMA is also illegal, psychologists can only use it to treat clients on an experimental research basis.
The preliminary findings from the Nova study are being closely followed by some of those Israeli clinicians experimenting with MDMA as treatment for PTSD after 7 October.
Dr Anna Harwood-Gross, a clinical psychologist and director of research at Israel's Metiv Psychotrauma Centre, described the initial findings as "really important" for therapists like her.
She is currently experimenting with using MDMA to treat PTSD within the Israeli military, and had worried about the ethics of inducing a vulnerable psychological state in clients when there is a war going on.
"At the beginning of the war, we questioned whether we were able to do this," she said. "Can we give people MDMA when there's a risk of an air raid siren? That's going to re-traumatise them potentially. This study has shown us that even if there's a traumatic event during therapy, the MDMA might also help process that trauma."
Dr Harwood-Gross says early indications of therapeutic MDMA use are encouraging, even among military veterans with chronic PTSD.
It has also upended old assumptions about the "rules" of therapy - especially the length of sessions, which have to be adjusted when working with clients under the influence of MDMA, she says.
"For example, it's changed our thoughts about 50-minute therapy sessions, with one patient and one therapist," Dr Harwood-Gross told me. "Having two therapists, and long sessions - up to eight hours long - is a new way of doing therapy. They're looking at people very holistically and giving them time."
She says this new longer format is showing promising results, even without patients taking MDMA, with a success rate of 40% in the placebo group.
Israeli society itself has also changed its approach to trauma and therapy following the 7 October attacks, according to Danny Brom, a founding director of the METIV Psychotrauma Centre at Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem, and a senior figure in the industry.
"It's as if this is the first trauma we're going through," he said. "I've seen wars here, I've seen lots of terrorist attacks and people said, 'We don't see trauma here'.
"Suddenly, there seems to be a general opinion that now everyone is traumatised, and everyone needs treatment. It's a wrong approach."
What broke, he said, is the sense of security many Jews believed Israel would provide them. These attacks uncovered a collective trauma, he says, linked to the Holocaust and generations of persecution.
"Our history is full of massacres," psychologist Vered Atzmon Meshulam told me. "As a psychologist now in Israel, we are faced with an opportunity to work with lots of traumas that weren't previously being treated, like all our narratives for 2,000 years."
Collective trauma, combat trauma, mind-altering drugs, sexual assault, hostages, survivors, body-collectors, the injured and the bereaved - Israel's trauma specialists are facing a complex cocktail of issues from the clients now flooding into therapy.
The scale of that mental health challenge is mirrored in Gaza, where vast numbers of people have been killed, injured or left homeless after a devastating 15-month war - and where there are scant resources to help a deeply traumatised population.
The war in Gaza, triggered by the Hamas attacks on Israeli communities in October 2023, was suspended in January in a six-week truce, during which Israeli hostages held by Hamas were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
But there is little sense on either side that the peace and security needed to begin healing has arrived.
The truce expired last weekend, with 59 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity. Many Gazans are waiting, with their bags packed, for war to resume.
Meanwhile Nova survivor Michal Ohana says she feels that with the passage of time, some are expecting her to have moved on from the attacks, but she is still affected.
"I wake up with this, and I go to sleep with this, and people don't understand," she told me.
"We live this every day. I feel the country supported us in the first months, but now after one year, they feel: 'OK, you need to go back to work, back to life.' But we can't."

Headline: Syrian government still faces threat from Assad loyalists
Author: Hugo Bachega, BBC Middle East correspondent, Reporting fromBeirut, Lebanon
Published Date: 2025-03-07T20:18:37.857Z
Text: In January, days after the first-month anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime in a lightning Islamist-led rebel offensive in Syria, a group of young men - some of them armed - were gathered, checking their phones in the nearly empty interior ministry headquarters in Damascus.
With Bashar al-Assad gone, they had arrived from Idlib, a region in the country's north-west that for years was the only opposition-controlled province in the country.
Virtually overnight, they had been catapulted to positions once controlled by hand-picked Assad supporters and, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, were in charge of a fractured country devastated by 13 years of civil war.
One of them, around 30 years old, had recently been appointed as a high-profile security official, and welcomed me to a room where any sign of the old regime had been removed. Tall and shy, the official made notes on his iPad while acknowledging that the new rulers faced enormous security challenges, including the threat coming from Assad loyalists.
The dismantling of the decades-old apparatus behind the oppressive machine of the Assads, such as the country's army and the ruling Baath party, meant the sacking of hundreds of thousands of people.
"There are Assad-affiliated people who haven't engaged with the reconciliation process," said the official, who requested anonymity to be able to discuss sensitive issues, citing the new authorities' call for former members of the security forces to surrender their weapons and ties to the old government.
"Our eyes are on everyone, but we don't want to give the impression that we're after them. That's why there haven't been massive raids."
Since then the violence has escalated, particularly in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous, a stronghold of the Assad family, but clashes were relatively contained. Until Thursday.
As forces linked to the government carried out an operation in the countryside of Latakia province, targeting a former Assad official, they were ambushed by gunmen.
At least 13 members of the security forces were killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, in what a regional official described as a well-planned attack carried out by "remnants of the Assad militias".
Initially limited to the Jableh area, the unrest spread more widely. Videos posted online showed heavy gunfire in different areas. The authorities sent reinforcements and, on Friday, further clashes killed more than 120 people, the Syrian Observatory said.
It marked the most violent day since Assad's fall and the biggest challenge yet to interim President Sharaa's transitional government and his efforts to consolidate authority.
According to the Institute for the Study of War, a research group, former Assad regime members are likely to form the most effective insurgent cells against Syria's new rulers with the ability to coordinate attacks.
"[They] already have pre-existing networks that they can leverage to rapidly organize insurgent cells. These networks are military, intelligence, and political networks and criminal syndicates who were regime supporters and lost significant economic and political influence in the aftermath of Assad's fall," they said in a report.
Syria's coastal areas are also the heartland of Assad's Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Its members held prominent roles in the Assad government but, with the arrival of Sunni Muslim-led rebels, lost the power and privilege they once had. They now say they are under attack and discrimination, despite Sharaa's pledges to respect different religious sects.
On Friday, activists said gunmen had killed dozens of male residents in Alawite areas, which will further exacerbate tensions – and possibly drive support for insurgents in their anti-government push. The Syrian Observatory said the gunmen were from the government's security forces, although this has not been verified.
The authorities also faced resistance from the Druze forces in the south, although a deal was reached earlier this week
The government in Damascus does not control the whole of Syria, where different factions - supported by different countries - exercise power over different regions.
But for Sharaa, the challenge goes beyond the task of trying to keep the country safe.
As Western suspicions over his intentions continue, his authorities are also struggling to get crippling sanctions imposed on Syria under the former regime lifted, a vital move to revive the economy of a country where nine in every 10 people are in poverty.

Text: Security forces of Syria's new rulers have engaged in heavy fighting with fighters loyal to deposed President Bashar al-Assad in a coastal area of the country.
It is the worst violence in Syria since rebels toppled Assad in December and installed an Islamist transitional government.
A war monitoring group, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said more than 70 people have been killed.
A curfew has been imposed in the cities of Latakia and Tartous, where the fighting has broken out.
BBC Verify confirmed the location of two videos posted online that showed gunmen shooting repeatedly at a building, igniting a fire inside, in the city of Homs on Thursday evening.
Two other verified videos show a body being dragged behind a car in Latakia.
The coastal region is the heartland of the Alawite minority, and a stronghold of the Assad family, which belong to the Alawite sect.
Estimations of the number of people killed in the violence vary, and the BBC has been unable to independently verify them.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday that 71 people had been killed, including 35 members of government forces, 32 gunmen affiliated to the former regime's army, and four civilians.
The clashes left tens of others injured, the human rights group said.
Gunmen, some from the former regime, had ambushed military forces, checkpoints and headquarters along the coastline, the organisation said.
One Sunni civilian witness called the attack "planned and prepared", while another told BBC Arabic that the indiscriminate firing on everyone including paramedics, was like something from the previous Assad regime.
"They did not have any mercy, so we are against any violence against anyone in the Syrian coast who has not been involve in this unrest. All of them are civilians and they are all like our family," they explained.
One Alawite said many Syrian people are "scared" regardless of if they were on the coast or in the capital.
Speaking to the BBC, she added that "everyone is terrified from the current incitement", and fears they will become "scapegoats".
Local gunmen took hold of military zones, where they holed up in areas in the Latakia mountains to launch attacks, while others holed up in Jableh city.
Members of the former regime army have been deployed in several coastal towns and villages, while military forces have been ambushed on highways.
Late on Thursday, Syrian-based Step news agency reported that government-aligned forces had killed "about 70" former regime fighters, while more than 25 others were captured in Jableh and the surrounding areas.
A spokesman for Syria's defence ministry, Colonel Hassan Abdul Ghani, issued a warning to Assad loyalists fighting in Latakia via state media.
"Thousands have chosen to surrender their weapons and return to their families, while some insist on fleeing and dying in defence of murderers and criminals. The choice is clear: lay down your weapons or face your inevitable fate," he said.
The region has become a major security challenge for interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa.
Alawite activists said their community had been subjected to violence and attacks since Assad fell, particularly in rural Homs and Latakia.
He is also facing resistance in the south, where there have been clashes with Druze forces in recent days.
Earlier this week, Syria's foreign minister told the global chemical weapons watchdog that the new government was committed to destroying any remaining stockpiles produced under-Assad.
Assad's government denied ever using chemical weapons during the 14-year civil war, but activists accused it of carrying out of dozens of chemical attacks.

Text: Syria's foreign minister has told the global chemical weapons watchdog that the new government is committed to destroying any remaining stockpiles produced under ousted president Bashar al-Assad.
Addressing a meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, Asaad al-Shibani vowed to "put an end to this painful legacy, to bring justice to victims, and to ensure that the compliance with international law is a solid one".
But he added that Syria would "need the support of the international community".
Assad's government denied ever using chemical weapons during the 14-year civil war, but activists accused it of carrying out of dozens of chemical attacks.
In 2013, rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were fired at several rebel-held suburbs in Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people. UN experts confirmed the use of the nerve agent sarin but they were not asked to ascribe any blame.
Assad denied his forces fired the rockets, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and allow a joint OPCW-UN mission to destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. However, questions about the accuracy and completeness of Syria's declaration remained.
The OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team documented multiple uses of chemical weapons during the war, identifying the Syrian military as the perpetrator of five cases of chemical weapons use in 2017 and 2018.
They included the April 2018 attack on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta, when a Syrian air force helicopter is believed to have dropped two cylinders filled with highly concentrated chlorine gas on two apartment buildings, killing at least 43 people.
An earlier OPCW fact-finding mission, which was not mandated to identify perpetrators, also found that chemical weapons were used or likely used in 20 other instances.
Last month, OPCW director general Fernando Arias visited Damascus to hold talks with Shibani and interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December.
At Wednesday's meeting, Arias declared that "the evolving political landscape in Syria" provided the international community with "a new and historic opportunity to complete the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons programme".
He said a team of technical experts from the OPCW would be deployed to Damascus in the coming days and begin planning visits to suspected chemical weapon sites.
Shibani also met the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, in The Hague on Wednesday.
The ICC said their talks "followed up on the prosecutor's January visit to Damascus, exploring partnerships towards accountability for crimes committed in Syria".
Syria is not a member of the ICC, but Khan has said the new government could accept the court's jurisdiction as a first step, as Ukraine has done with respect to the war with Russia.

Headline: Gaza food prices soar after Israel halts aid deliveries

Text: Food prices in Gaza have risen sharply and aid food parcels could soon run out after Israel blocked the entry of humanitarian aid, the UN's humanitarian agency said.
OCHA's partners reported that flour and vegetable prices had more than doubled in some cases, with Gazans telling the BBC the same.
If the blockade continued, "at least 80 community kitchens may soon run out of stock" and remaining food parcels that "will support 500,000 people, will soon run out", OCHA said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chose to stop aid at the weekend, accusing Hamas of stealing supplies and refusing a US proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire. A Hamas spokesman said the halt was "cheap blackmail".
The foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza "catastrophic" and expressing deep concern at Israel's action.
"A halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza, such as that announced by the government of Israel would risk violating international humanitarian law," the statement read. "Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool."
The ministers said it was vital that the ceasefire was sustained, all hostages held by Hamas were released, and continued flows of aid were ensured.
Thousands of aid trucks had surged into Gaza each week under the ceasefire deal that started on 19 January.
After the ceasefire's first phase expired on Saturday night, Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of stealing aid "to finance its terror machine".
Hamas has previously denied stealing humanitarian aid in Gaza.
Netanyahu also said Hamas was refusing to accept a six-week ceasefire extension, under different terms from those previously agreed, as proposed by US President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After the halt of aid in response, OCHA said on Tuesday that some community kitchens which remain operational "will need to start to adjust meal content or reduce the number of meals prepared to cope with anticipated shortages".
Partners would also "be forced to reduce food rations". While they are distributing previously dispatched food parcels, remaining supplies are expected to run out.
Abu Qais Aryan, from Khan Younis, told BBC Arabic the cost of basic goods doubled over Sunday night. Prices had already doubled or tripled since the war began, he said.
Other residents said the price of a 1kg (2.2lb) of tomatoes rose overnight from five shekels ($1.38; £1.07) to 10, and a 1kg of cucumbers from six to 17 shekels.
"We could barely afford to buy a kilo of tomatoes just to satisfy our hunger," said one man, Issam, adding that people could not buy food "because there is no cash liquidity".
Issa Meit, from Gaza City, said there was a shortage of goods and very high consumption, and he was "very afraid that prices will increase again".
"The recent decision is unfair as it wrongs our children. How will our children live in light of these high prices that will increase in an arbitrary way?" he said.
Some blamed merchants for hiking prices, saying they were exploiting the situation.
Merchant Mahmoud Abu Mohsen told BBC Arabic he raised prices because the wholesalers he purchases from did as well.
"For example, I used to buy sugar for five shekels, three shekels, or four shekels, but now I buy sugar for six shekels, meaning I don't make more than a small profit," he said. "The news that Netanyahu announced is what caused a stir among the people."
A spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Caroline Seguin, told the BBC on Wednesday that in Gaza City, the price of just over 2lb (900g) of sugar had risen from just over $1 (78p) to $5.
In Khan Younis and Gaza City, the cost of a carton of 30 eggs had shot up around 150%, she added.
"The news has created uncertainty and fear, causing food prices to spike," Ms Seguin said in an earlier statement. "Israel is once again blocking an entire population from receiving aid, using it as a bargaining chip. This is unacceptable, outrageous, and will have devastating consequences."
Qatar and Egypt, which helped mediate the ceasefire along with the US, condemned Israel's move.
Qatar's foreign ministry called the decision "a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement" and "international humanitarian law" in a statement.
Egypt's foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as "a weapon against the Palestinian people".
Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said in a video briefing that "Hamas has hoarded for months and months of supplies. They have enough food to fuel an obesity epidemic."
"The supplies are there but Hamas doesn't share," he added.
A month ago, OCHA said more than a million people - roughly half of Gaza's population - had received food assistance since the ceasefire began.
All aid, not just food, is affected by the blockade.
Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said that inside Gaza, it had some medicine in reserve for its clinics and assistive devices for people with disabilities, in addition to hygiene kits.
"However, we don't currently have high aid reserves as most items entering were for immediate distribution," the charity said.
Ms Seguin said even though it appeared MSF's medical supplies would last for a few months, "it doesn't mean that we haven't been consistently running short of essentials".
The main concern for the health system, she said, was fuel for generators at hospitals to ensure ventilators and other critical medical equipment continued to work.
She said "the consequences will be at the cost of the people in Gaza".
The ceasefire aimed to end 15 months of conflict, which erupted after Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.
Israel responded with an air and ground campaign in Gaza that killed at least 48,405 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Among them is six-month-old Niveen Abu Daqqa, who has a heart condition, and her mother Enas – she left four children behind in Gaza to accompany her.
They are travelling under an agreement reached between Israel and Jordan that is backed by the United States. Each child is accompanied by at least one family member, and all who evacuated Gaza were cleared to leave by Israel.

Text: Rami Qattoush's mother beams with pride, as her nine-year-old son tentatively kicks a football for the first time since his injury.
It is a huge milestone in his recovery, since he travelled to Jordan last month after getting Israeli military approval to leave Gaza.
Rami dreams of playing football one day, like Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is still in pain and quickly tires, having to sit down on a plastic chair, exhausted from the effort.
His bandaged legs - one of them splinted - are badly scarred and withered.
Every step forward is hard.
Doctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs.
Warning - This article contains distressing content
The boys had been fast asleep in the family's third-floor flat in Maghazi in central Gaza when, their mother says, an Israeli air strike targeted the building next door, raining rubble and shrapnel on the children.
Rami's 12-year-old brother, Mustafa, was killed, his body blown to pieces.
His heart, pierced with shrapnel, was only found two days later, Islam says. The family gave it a separate burial.
The UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people.
Medical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment.
An estimated 30,000 Gazans – like Rami and Abdul Salam – have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization.
It has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people – among them 4,500 children – still need to be brought out for treatment.
"The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children," the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January.
Rami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved.
"Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'" Islam says.
And then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman.
It is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more.
"It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war," says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. "It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery."
Rami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small "School of the Future", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner.
But he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him.
They're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can.
"Gaza is beautiful," Rami told me. "In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped."
With the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress.
"He arrived in a wheelchair," says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again.
"He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud."
He also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza.
But many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home.
Not knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna.
Sharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs.
He was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings. In hospital in Gaza, a nurse trying to cheer him up told him his mother had turned into a star.
"Since then, he looks up into the sky at night, looking for stars and talking to them," his aunt Sabah says. "He doesn't talk to other people. But I hear him saying to the stars: 'Mummy I've eaten, Mummy I'm going to sleep now.'"
The psychological injuries of the hospital patients are often tougher than the physical.
"Some will never recover," says hospital director Roshan Kumarasamy, who says that reconstructive surgery will be needed on patients from Gaza for years to come because of an "unimaginably massive spectrum of injuries".
But Rami is strong and determined. When he breaks down in tears thinking of Mustafa, he reassures me it's "OK".
And when he and his mother manage to get through to his family in Gaza on a video call, Rami is eager to show them how he can now stand on his own two feet.
His father cheers him on, saying: "Rami, you're a hero."
And now his family have another reason to celebrate – Rami's brother, Abdul Salam, and his father have just been given permission by Israel to leave Gaza for Jordan as well.
In the weeks to come, he should be fitted with a new leg, allowing both injured boys to relearn how to walk.

Text: The level of destruction in Jabalia when viewed from the air is truly astonishing.
A Hiroshima-like wasteland stretches as far as the eye can see. The mangled carcasses of buildings dot the churned-up landscape, some leaning at crazy angles.
Great undulating waves of rubble make it all but impossible to make out the geography of this once bustling, tightly packed refugee camp.
And yet, as a drone camera flies over the wreckage, it picks out splashes of blue and white where small tent camps have been set up in patches of open ground.
And figures, clambering over broken buildings, moving along streets of dirt, where food markets are springing up under tin roofs and canvas awnings. Children using a collapsed roof as a slide.
After more than six weeks of Gaza's fragile ceasefire, Jabalia is slowly coming back to life.
In the neighbourhood of al-Qasasib, Nabil has returned to a four-storey house that's somehow still standing, even if it lacks windows, doors and - in some places - walls.
He and his relatives have made crude balconies out of wooden pallets and strung-up tarpaulin to keep out the elements.
"Look at the destruction," he says as he surveys Jabalia's ocean of ruins from a gaping upper floor.
"They want us to leave without rebuilding it? How can we leave. The least we can do is rebuild it for our children."
To cook a meal, Nabil lights a fire on the bare staircase, stoking it carefully with pieces of torn-up cardboard.
On another floor, Laila Ahmed Okasha washes up in a sink where the tap ran dry months ago.
"There's no water, electricity or sewage," she says. "If we need water, we have to go to a far place to fill up buckets."
She says she cried when she came back to the house and found it wrecked.
She blames Israel and Hamas for destroying the world she once knew.
"Both of them are responsible," she says. "We had a decent, comfortable life."
Soon after the war began in October 2023, Israel told Palestinians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip – including Jabalia – to move south for their own safety.
Hundreds of thousands of people heeded the warning, but many stayed, determined to ride out the war.
Laila and her husband Marwan clung on until October last year, when the Israeli military reinvaded Jabalia, saying Hamas had reconstituted fighting units inside the camp's narrow streets.
After two months of sheltering in nearby Shati camp, Leila and Marwan returned to find Jabalia almost unrecognisable.
"When we came back and saw how it was destroyed, I didn't want to stay here anymore," Marwan says.
"I had a wonderful life, but now it's a hell. If I have the chance to leave, I'll go. I won't stay one more minute."
Stay or go? The future of Gaza's civilian population is now the subject of international debate.
In February, Donald Trump suggested that the US should take over Gaza and that nearly two million Palestinian residents should leave, possibly for good.
Faced with international outrage and fierce opposition from Arab leaders, Trump has subsequently appeared to back away from the plan, saying he recommended it but would not force it on anyone.
In the meantime, Egypt has led Arab efforts to come up with a viable alternative, to be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday.
Crucially, it says the Palestinian population should remain inside Gaza while the area is reconstructed.
Donald Trump's intervention has brought out Gaza's famously stubborn side.
"If Trump wants to make us leave, I'll stay in Gaza," Laila says. "I want to travel on my own free will. I won't leave because of him."
Across the way sits a nine-storey yellow block of flats so spectacularly damaged it's hard to believe it hasn't collapsed.
The upper floors have caved in entirely, threatening the rest. In time, it will surely have to be demolished, but for now it's home to yet more families. There are sheets in the windows and washing hanging to dry in the late winter sunshine.
Most incongruously of all, outside a makeshift plastic doorway on a corner of the ground floor, next to piles of rubble and rubbish, stands a headless mannequin, wearing a wedding gown.
It's Sanaa Abu Ishbak's dress shop.
The 45-year-old seamstress, mother of 11, set up the business two years before the war but had to abandon it when she fled south in November 2023.
She came back as soon as the ceasefire was announced. With her husband and daughters, she's been busy clearing debris from the shop, arranging dresses on hangers and getting ready for business.
"I love Jabalia camp," she says, "and I won't leave it till I die."
Sanaa and Laila seem equally determined to stay put if they can. But both women speak differently when they talk of the young.
"She doesn't even know how to write her own name," Laila says of her granddaughter.
"There's no education in Gaza."
The little girl's mother was killed during the war. Laila says she still talks to her at night.
"She was the soul of my soul and she left her daughter in my hands. If I have the chance to travel, I will do so for the sake of my granddaughter."

Headline: Police to interview Crown actor over Gaza rally

Text: Actor Khalid Abdalla says he has been told to attend a police interview following a pro-Palestinian protest in January.
Abdalla, who played Dodi Fayed in Netflix series The Crown, said on social media he had received a letter from the Metropolitan Police on Thursday.
The Metropolitan Police confirmed to the BBC that eight people had been "invited to be interviewed under caution at a police station" as part of an "ongoing investigation into alleged breaches of Public Order Act conditions on Saturday 18 January".
In an Instagram post, Abdalla said it remained to be seen if charges would result, adding that "the right to protest is under attack in this country".
Abdalla, who also starred in United 93, The Kite Runner and The Day of the Jackal, is one of Hollywood's most outspoken actors on the Gaza-Israel war. He has publicly called for a permanent ceasefire.
The actor has attended several pro-Palestinian demos, including the one on 18 January he will be interviewed by the police about.
And he was a signatory to the Artists for Palestine UK open letter to the BBC in February, criticising the corporation's decision to pull a documentary about children's lives in Gaza after it discovered its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.
Abdalla is not the first public figure to face a police interview following the January rally.
The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have already been questioned by officers.
The Met has not identified the pair but said at the time that two men, aged 75 and 73, had subsequently been "released pending further investigations".
A static rally involving several thousand people took place in Whitehall after police blocked plans to hold a march from Portland Place, near the headquarters of the BBC.
Police said conditions had been clearly communicated that those taking part in the protest should remain in Whitehall.
"Despite this, a large group made its way from Whitehall into Trafalgar Square and in some cases attempted to go further."
Police said that a number of people in that group have been arrested on suspicion of breaching the conditions - and that so far, 21 had been charged.
The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, which organised the protest, said: "What is claimed by the police as justification for this massive overreach of their powers is a complete misrepresentation of what took place, not just on the day but beforehand."
And it added: "We demand that the Metropolitan Police halt any prosecutions or proceedings against those involved in this entirely peaceful protest."

Headline: Israeli police say one killed in Haifa bus station knife attack

Text: An Israeli man has been killed and four other people have been wounded in what police say was a terrorist stabbing attack in the northern Israeli city of Haifa.
Police said an Israeli Druze man attacked civilians with a knife after getting off a bus at HaMifratz Central station. He was shot dead at the scene by a security guard.
The victim who died was named as Hassan Dahamsha, 70, from the predominantly Arab town of Kafr Kanna. Paramedics said three of the wounded - a 15-year-old boy, and a man and a woman in their 30s - were in a serious condition.
The attacker was from Shfaram, another mainly Arab town, and had recently returned from abroad, police said, without specifying a motive.
Israeli Druze leaders condemned the rare attack by a member of their community.
The Druze are an ethnic and religious group whose faith is an offshoot of Shia Islam. About 150,000 live in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, comprising about 1.5% of the population.
Witnesses and security officials said the perpetrator of Monday morning's attack travelled to Haifa on a bus from Shfaram, which is about 10km (6 miles) east of the city.
"A bus arrived, and someone got off with a knife, shouted 'Allahu Akbar' ['God is greatest' in Arabic], and started stabbing people indiscriminately," one woman told the Haaretz newspaper.
A security officer was cited as saying the attacker stabbed three people waiting at the station and then went to a security checkpoint, where he stabbed an elderly man before being shot dead by the guard.
A police spokesman said the attacker had been abroad for the past few months and had returned to Israel in February.
Israeli media named him as Yitro Shaheen, 20, and reported that he had German citizenship and had lived in Germany.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "My wife Sara and I send our deepest condolences to the family of the man who was murdered in the shocking terrorist attack in Haifa.
"We will continue to fight everywhere against those who seek to murder us and we will defeat them."
The spiritual leader of Israel's Druze community, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, also condemned the attack. But he added: "Before passing judgment, it is important to wait for a thorough investigation and full clarification of the facts by the security forces."
Druze lawmaker Hamad Amar of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party insisted that the attack "does not reflect the true spirit of the Druze community in Israel, which is a full partner in defending the state and its values".
Shfaram's mayor, Nahid Khazem, also said the town's residents were deeply shocked by the "despicable crime" in Haifa.
"His extended family say that he was mentally unstable, but I have no documents to confirm this," he told Haaretz.
There was no immediate claim from any armed groups, but Hamas described the attack as "heroic" and a "natural response" to what it called Israeli crimes against Palestinians.
It comes amid deadlock between Hamas and Israel over moving forward with the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire deal.
Israel stopped aid from entering Gaza after Hamas rejected what Netanyahu's office said was a US proposal for an extension to the first phase, which ended on Saturday night.
Hamas accused Israel of reneging on the deal and said the second phase should go ahead as agreed.

Headline: What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal

Text: A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been under way since January, but its future is uncertain.
The deal involves exchanging hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel in stages, and aims to end the war.
But the process has now reached an impasse, raising fears of a return to fighting.
The war was triggered when Hamas attacked on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.
Israel responded with triggered a massive Israeli military offensive, which has killed more than 48,300 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.
The ceasefire was announced on 15 January and began four days later, after months of negotiations led by the US, Qatar and Egypt. It is based on a proposal set out by former US President Joe Biden in May 2024. The deal involves three stages:
Stage one
This officially lasted for 42 days, during which:
Stage two
Negotiations on the second stage were meant to begin 16 days after the start of stage one - but this did not happen. Like stage one, stage two is also meant to be completed within 42 days.
According to the ceasefire deal, under stage two:
Stage three
The final part of the agreement would see:
Since 1 March, when stage one expired, the ceasefire has been in limbo. Stage two has not begun, and both sides are digging their heels in.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 2 March that Israel had accepted a plan by US envoy Steve Witkoff "to extend the temporary ceasefire by 50 days" to discuss the second stage.
Netanyahu said that under the plan, half the remaining hostages would be released straight away, and the remainder released if an agreement was reached. Witkoff himself has not commented.
Netanyahu said Israel would stop letting goods and supplies into Gaza because Hamas had rejected the new proposal, warning: "There will be no free lunches."
He also claimed Hamas had been stealing the aid - something the group has previously denied - and using it "to finance its terror machine" against Israel.
The prime minister vowed to take additional, unspecified, steps, if Hamas stuck to its position and did not release the hostages.
Hamas said it rejected Israel's attempt to extend the first stage, calling it "a blatant attempt to evade the agreement and avoid entering into negotiations for the second phase".
It is unclear how the gap between the two sides can be bridged - and if not, where that might lead.
Israel says 59 hostages are still being held in Gaza, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive and at least 35 are presumed dead.
The 33 Israeli hostages released under the deal have included female Israeli soldiers, male and female Israeli civilians, and two children. Five living Thai hostages were also freed outside of the deal.
The living hostages were released by Hamas in stage-managed events in different locations in Gaza, where they were handed over to the Red Cross.
The Red Cross then transferred them to Israeli forces inside Gaza, before they were driven across the border into Israel and reunited with their families. The freed hostages were then flown to hospitals for medical checks.
The bodies of four hostages were also handed over in a spectacle condemned by Israel and others.
Around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza were released in the first phase of the deal.
Many of those released in the first exchange, and some in the following three exchanges, had never been charged and were detained without trial in Israeli prisons under what is called "administrative detention", a process widely criticised by human rights groups.
Others had been found guilty of serious crimes, including being convicted by Israeli courts of multiple murders. Dozens had been serving life sentences.
The released prisoners have returned to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and in some cases, Gaza. Dozens were deported abroad due to the gravity of their crimes.
Israel has insisted that no-one who was involved in the 7 October attacks will be freed.
The prisoners are among more than 10,000 Palestinians held by Israel (not including detainees from Gaza held by the Israeli military) who have either been convicted, or are suspected of "security" offences.
These range from bombings and other attacks, to belonging to banned armed groups.
More than 3,000 people are reported to be held under administrative detention.
Israel says 4,200 lorries carrying aid have entered Gaza each week since the ceasefire was agreed in mid-January.
Half of the supplies were destined for the north of Gaza, where aid had been hardest to deliver and food security experts had been warning of imminent famine.
But from 2 March, Israel stopped supplies being allowed in to the territory.
Arab states and the UN condemned Israel's actions as a violation of the ceasefire agreement and against international law.
Aid agencies have managed to store supplies, which means there is no immediate danger to the civilian population. But the longer the ban lasts, the greater the pressure on making supplies last.
Gaza is home to an estimated 2.1 million Palestinians, almost all of whom had to leave their homes as Israel carried out continuous strikes across the territory and issued mass evacuation orders for large residential areas.
Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have returned home, but in many cases there is nothing to go back to, with whole streets and neighbourhoods standing in ruin.
Some 60% to 70% of buildings are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed.
The process is also fraught with danger, with Israeli and Hamas forces at tense standoff, risks of unexploded ordnance, and warnings from the Israeli military to civilians to stay clear of military positions.
Rebuilding Gaza will be a monumental task. Halfway through the war, the UN estimated that at that point reconstruction could cost $40bn (£33bn). It is something which is likely to take years, if not decades.
The human cost of the conflict will also be felt for many years to come, with tens of thousands wounded and left with complex psychological damage.

Headline: British-Israeli hostage says scars show 'hope' ahead of surgery

Text: A British-Israeli hostage released by Hamas after 15 months in captivity has said her scars represented "freedom, hope and strength" as she underwent a series of surgeries for her injuries.
Emily Damari, 28, was shot in the hand as she was dragged from her home in southern Israel during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, causing her to lose two fingers.
She said an operation in Gaza had left her in "intense pain" for a year and a half, and that a scar from an "open, festering wound" did not heal for months due to the conditions in which she was held.
Ahead of her treatment, Ms Damari said she had "fully embraced" the pain and injuries because of what they symbolise to her.
Ms Damari was held by Hamas in Gaza for 471 days prior to her release. She was one of the first hostages to be freed as part of a ceasefire deal struck between the Palestinian armed group and Israel after 15 months of fighting.
She was taken from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, near the Gaza border, on the morning of Hamas's unprecedented attack.
Ms Damari was also shot in the leg, and previously said she had only received an out-of-date bottle of iodine to treat her wounds while in captivity.
The 28-year-old said the complex operations on her hand and leg in Israel's Sheba Medical Center had gone "much better than expected".
She said the scar on her hand was "looking better" and that the pain, caused by "the nerves being sewn together" in Gaza, had gone.
Now, with the help of physiotherapy, she hoped to have improved use of her hand.
But Ms Damari noted that her recovery would take time and her hand would "never fully recover".
She said the conditions in which hostages were being held were "unimaginable".
"It was shocking but not surprising to see how emaciated some of the other hostages were when they came out," she reflected.
"Hamas has created hell on Earth," she said, adding that there were others whose mental and physical health was "in much worse shape" than hers. She called for the release of all remaining hostages without delay.
Ms Damari's mother, who grew up in Beckenham in south-east London, added that her daughter had been "sewn up like a pin-cushion" in Gaza.
"It is nothing short of a miracle that she did not contract a life-threatening infection," said Mandy Damari.
Ms Damari said she was "so excited" to visit the UK with her mother once she had healed and the remaining hostages are released.
"I have so many people that I want to thank personally for helping me get my life back."
The pair have been invited to Downing Street by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who previously spoke to Ms Damari over the phone.
During that conversation, she said she had been held at United Nations facilities during her captivity. The UN's Gaza agency has called for an independent investigation into the allegation.
In total, 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and a further 1,200 people were killed.
The attack triggered a war which has devastated Gaza. Israel's military offensive killed at least 48,365 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The first phase of a ceasefire came into force on 19 January, allowing the release of 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.

Text: Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza as it demands Hamas agree to a US plan for a ceasefire extension.
The first phase of a truce deal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US expired on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas was refusing to accept a temporary extension proposed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
A Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was "cheap blackmail" and a "coup" on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene.
The ceasefire deal halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
The internationally-mediated ceasefire plan - originally proposed by Joe Biden - envisages three stages.
The first phase came into force on 19 January and expired on Saturday.
Negotiations on phase two, meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, were due to have started weeks ago, but have barely begun.
Phase three is meant to result in the return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years.
Hamas has previously said it will not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from the mediators that phase two would eventually take place.
As the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday, Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed to Witkoff's proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods.
If, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war.
Witkoff has not made his proposal public. According to Israel, it would begin with the release of half of all the remaining living and dead hostages.
Witkoff is said by Israel to have proposed the temporary extension after becoming convinced that more time was needed to try to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas on conditions for ending the war.
A statement from Netanyahu's office said: "With the end of Phase 1 of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks - to which Israel agreed - Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease.
"Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences."
The Hamas spokesman said: "Netanyahu's decision to stop aid going into Gaza once again shows the ugly face of the Israeli occupation... The international community must apply pressure on the Israeli government to stop starving our people."
Aid agencies confirmed that no aid trucks had been allowed into Gaza on Sunday morning.
"Humanitarian assistance has to continue to flow into Gaza. It's very essential. And we are calling all parties to make sure that they reach a solution," Antoine Renard from the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC.
Thousands of trucks entered the Gaza Strip each week since the ceasefire was agreed in mid-January.
Aid agencies have managed to store supplies, which means there is no immediate danger to the civilian population from this morning's Israeli decision.
Egypt has called for the previously agreed upon ceasefire deal to be implemented in full.
The Egyptian foreign minister said his country would present a plan to rebuild Gaza without displacing its people at an emergency Arab summit on Tuesday.
Also on Sunday, medics said four people had been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza. The Israeli military said it had attacked people who were planting an explosive device in the north of the territory.
There are believed to be 24 hostages alive, with another 35 presumed to be dead.
Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage.
Israel responded with an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Text: Where next? The first six-week phase of the Gaza ceasefire ends on Saturday.
The 42 days since 19 January have seen their fair share of uncertainty, hope, grief and anger, but everything that should have happened in that time has.
Israeli hostages - the living and the dead - have been released. Palestinian prisoners set free.
But negotiations on phase two, including the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, have barely begun.
Talks opened in Cairo on Friday but Israel's delegation returned home in the evening.
Reports suggested that negotiations would continue "at a distance" and that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold late-night consultations with the delegation, senior ministers and intelligence chiefs.
For such a meeting to take place late on the sabbath was highly unusual. No statements emerged from the consultations, with reports suggesting they would continue on Saturday night.
Israel appears to be looking to extend the current phase for another six weeks, to get more hostages back and release more Palestinian prisoners but without withdrawing its troops.
The government here is adamant that Hamas, the group responsible for the massacres of 7 October 2023 and the taking of 251 hostages, has to lay down its arms and relinquish any form of authority in the Gaza Strip.
Israel also says it is not yet ready to leave the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border - a process that should have begun on Saturday.
"We will not allow the Hamas murderers to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling," an unnamed Israeli official said in a statement sent to reporters on Friday.
Such anonymous quotes are often believed to come directly from the prime minister's office.
Last summer, efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza faltered when Netanyahu insisted on keeping Israeli troops stationed along the Philadelphi corridor.
On Friday night, Hamas said it would not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that phase two would eventually take place.
Hamas seems determined to remain a force in Gaza, even if it might be willing to hand over day-to-day governance to other Palestinian actors, including the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority.
Egypt has been working on a reconstruction plan for Gaza, as an alternative to Donald Trump's proposal to take the area over and evacuate its entire civilian population.
But Western diplomats are not optimistic that the plan, due to be unveiled at an Arab League summit in Cairo next Tuesday, has the sort of robust security and governance arrangements that will be needed to meet Israeli demands.
This is a critical moment.
For all the emotional turmoil of the last few weeks, Israelis have come to expect the gradual release of hostages. There are believed to be 24 alive, still waiting to be freed, with another 39 presumed to be dead.
Israelis desperately want them all back, without the sort of propaganda displays that have disgusted and infuriated the entire country.
If the whole process now grinds to a halt, public anger – at Hamas and their own government - will mount. Further street protests are planned, including one on Saturday night in the place in Tel Aviv that all Israelis now know as Hostages Square.
"We demand the return of all 59 remaining hostages by day 50 of the agreement," reads the invitation from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum HQ.
"Now is our only window of opportunity – we won't get another."
UN Secretary General António Guterres has weighed in, urging the parties "to spare no effort to avoid a breakdown of this deal".
On Saturday evening, Israelis were once again horrified by the sight of hostages being paraded in front of the cameras, in a video released by Hamas.
In the latest in a long line of cruel, harrowing videos released over the past 16 months, five Israeli hostages are seen, two of them with their faces blurred.
Two of the hostages, Iair Horn and Sagui Dekel Chen, were released two weeks ago.
In the video, Iair is seen embracing and saying goodbye to his younger brother, Eitan, suggesting the scene was filmed shortly before Iair and Sagui were released.
The emotions are raw and the scene deeply distressing, with both brothers in tears and Eitan pleading to Benjamin Netanyahu to stick with the ceasefire deal and release all remaining hostages.
The video is clearly designed, once again, to play on the frayed emotions of the Israeli public and heap pressure on the Israeli prime minister.
In a statement released by his office, Netanyahu accused Hamas of producing "another cruel propaganda video in which our hostages are forced to engage in psychological warfare."
Israel, the statement said, would not be deterred by Hamas propaganda.
"We will continue to act relentlessly for the return of all of our hostages and until all objectives of the war are met."
There's a widespread belief that, sooner or later, the war will begin again.
It's a bleak prospect, for the hostages and for two million Palestinians in Gaza who are trying to put their lives back together in the current, fragile peace.
In a place where families are still digging bodies from the rubble, sometimes with their bare hands, the thought of a resumption of a conflict which has already claimed tens of thousands of lives is chilling.
Areas in the middle of the Gaza Strip that have so far escaped the worst of the conflict would likely suffer badly from any return to war, making it even harder to sustain life in this ravaged strip of land.

Headline: Israel's military failed to protect civilians, first report on 7 October attack says
Author: Paul Adams, BBC News, Reporting fromJerusalem

Text: Israel's military has published its first official account of the mistakes that led to its failures during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war.
The report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) "failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians".
The 19-page report contains much that is already known about what led to catastrophic loss of about 1,200 lives when approximately 5,000 gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups stormed into Israel, also taking 251 hostages in the process.
There are no dramatic revelations, but it is still sobering to see the military's conclusions about how it misjudged Hamas's intentions and underestimated its capabilities laid out in black and white.
The report says the military regarded Gaza as a secondary security threat, with priority given to Iran and Hezbollah. Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was "paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative".
The military had chosen a "conflict management" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was "neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.
Evidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as "unrealistic or unfeasible", reflecting "Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat".
The report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas's plan was not merely a vision but "a concrete framework for operational planning".
However, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.
The report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed.
"There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?" the report says.
Over time, "a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality" had developed.
The report also highlights what it says was "a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history".
It calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, "fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement".
It says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.
The Gaza Division, it says, "was effectively defeated for several hours" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively.
It says the Air Force responded quickly, but that "there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists".
The report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians.
After presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures.
"I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me," he said in a video.
Last month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war.
His critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault.
Israel responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Text: A total of 25 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have been released alive as part of a long-awaited ceasefire deal with Israel, which began on 19 January 2025.
The bodies of another eight hostages have also been handed over by Hamas under the deal, which has seen around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails freed in exchange.
Five living Thai nationals have also been released outside the framework.
On 22 February, Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov and Omer Wenkert were released in Nuseirat, central Gaza, while Avera Mengistu and Tal Shoham were freed in Rafah, southern Gaza. The sixth and final hostage Hisham al-Sayed was handed over to the Red Cross in a private exchange in Gaza City.

Eliya Cohen, 27, and his girlfriend Ziv Abud fled the attack on the Supernova music festival on 7 October 2023 and hid in a bomb shelter with relatives and friends. However, Hamas gunmen found the shelter and opened fire. Eliya was discovered and driven away, but Ziv escaped.
Omer Shem Tov, 22, initially made a getaway from the festival in his car but was captured when he tried to rescue his friends, Maya and Itai Regev. All three were taken captive - the Regev siblings were released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. His mother said he was kept alone in an underground tunnel for the vast majority of his time in captivity.
Tal Shoham, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife, Adi, their two young children, and his mother-in-law, Dr Shosham Haran, were also captured but released in November 2023. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom, was killed during the 7 October attack.
Omer Wenkert, 23, sent a message to his family to say he was going to a safe shelter after the Supernova music festival was attacked, but he then lost contact with them. His family said they saw Hamas video footage of Omer, including a photo of him handcuffed and wearing only underwear. In an Instagram post published following his release, Omer said the first thing he had told his mother upon their reunification was: "I defeated captivity."
Hisham al-Sayed, 37,is a Bedouin Arab Israeli who had been held by Hamas since he entered Gaza on his own in 2015. Hamas said he and Avera Mengistu were soldiers, but Israeli documents seen by Human Rights Watch show that both were civilians exempted from military service. Hisham's family said he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and entered Gaza while in mental distress. Following his release, Hisham's father said Hamas had "played politics on the back of a mentally ill man".
Avera Mengistu, 39 an Ethiopian-Israeli, was seized by Hamas after entering Gaza on his own in 2014. In January Hamas released a short undated video clip of a man who mumbled in Hebrew: "I am the captive Avera Mengistu. For how much longer will I remain in captivity with my friends." After he was released, his family said he had endured 10 years of "unimaginable suffering".

Ofer was released on 1 February as part of the ceasefire agreement.

On 26 February 2025, Hamas handed over the bodies of four male Israeli hostages, in the final exchange scheduled during the six-week-long first phase of the ceasefire deal.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged that three of the men - Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69 - "were murdered while held hostage in Gaza".

Text: More than 15 months after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 that triggered the war in Gaza, a ceasefire deal came into effect that has led to the release of some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
On 26 February, Hamas handed over the bodies of four Israeli hostages, in the final exchange scheduled during the six-week-long first phase of the agreement.
Israel later identified them as Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the four men had been murdered.
A total of 25 living and eight dead hostages have been released by Hamas in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees during the first phase.
Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining 59 hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - have not yet begun.
These are the stories of those hostages who are still being held, which have either been confirmed by the BBC or credibly reported.
This list is updated and names may change, as some people feared kidnapped are confirmed to have been killed or released.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged that three of the men - Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat - "were murdered while held hostage in Gaza". The fourth, Shlomo Mansour, was "murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip", he said.

The previous week, Hamas handed over the bodies of another four hostages - Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, as well as Oded Lifschitz, an 84-year-old veteran peace activist.
Kfir, aged nine months, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was the youngest of the hostages snatched on 7 October 2023. His brother, Ariel, was just four.
In November 2023, Hamas said an Israeli air strike in Gaza had killed Shiri and her sons. However, after their bodies handed over, the Israeli military's spokesman said post-mortem exams and intelligence showed the boys had been murdered by their captors "with their bare hands". The Israeli prime minister said later that Shiri was also murdered.
At the start of February 2024, Shiri's husband, Yarden Bibas, was released by Hamas without his immediate family.
Oded Lifshitz was dragged by gunmen from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023 and taken to Gaza alive. The Israeli prime minister's office said he was "murdered in captivity" by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
On 1 September 2024, the IDF announced that its forces had recovered the bodies of six hostages - Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino.
The IDF said they had been murdered by Hamas shortly before Israeli forces could reach them.
On 8 August, it was announced that the bodies of Abraham Munder, Alex Dancyg, Yagev Buchshtab, Chaim Peri, Yoram Metzger and Nadav Popplewell - all of whom who died in Hamas captivity - had been extracted from Gaza by the IDF and returned to Israel.
Omer Neutra, a 22-year-old Israeli-American and grandson of Holocaust survivors, was serving as a tank commander near Gaza when Hamas attacked. Omer's parents said they were told by the Israeli embassy that he had been kidnapped, however the IDF later said he was killed on 7 October and his body taken to Gaza.
In November 2023, the bodies of 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano and 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss were found by Israeli troops in buildings close to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
In December 2023, the Israeli military expressed "deep remorse" after soldiers mistakenly killed three hostages in northern Gaza who had escaped from their captors. They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26.
In January 2025, the body of Yousef Zyadna, a 53-year-old Bedouin dairy farmer, was found by the Israeli military in an underground tunnel in the southern Rafah area. The IDF later said his son Hamza Zyadna, 22, had been killed in Hamas captivity, after a forensic examination of remains. Yousef's other children, Bilal, 19, and Aisha, 17 had also been abducted but were released in November 2023.

Headline: Israel confirms Hamas handed over hostages' bodies as Palestinian prisoners released
Author: David Gritten & George Wright, BBC News

Text: Israel has completed forensic tests confirming the identities of four dead Israeli hostages whose bodies were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
On Wednesday night, Hamas passed four coffins to the Red Cross from Gaza. Israel's prime minister confirmed on Thursday that they contained the remains of Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69, and said all four men had been murdered.
The handover cleared the way for the delayed release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
It was the last exchange of the six-week-long first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, leaving questions over what happens next.
Hamas has said it is ready to start delayed indirect negotiations on the second phase, which aims to end the war and secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who faces pressures from his political allies to resume fighting and crush Hamas - said he had instructed negotiators to depart for Cairo on Thursday for talks.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,365 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter.
Hamas handed over the four men's bodies late on Wednesday night, with no public ceremony, unlike in previous exchanges during the current ceasefire.
Israeli authorities carried out initial forensic testing close to the Israel-Gaza border before transferring the remains to the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv.
It came after the body of a Palestinian woman from Gaza was handed over by Hamas to Israel instead of the body of hostage Shiri Bibas last week, prompting fury in Israel. Hamas said it was a mistake and transferred Bibas's body the following day.
Following the identification of the bodies received overnight, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that military officials had informed the Mansour, Yahalomi, Idan and Elgarat families that their loved ones "were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel".
"Pursuant to the intelligence and all of the information at our disposal, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat were murdered while held hostage in Gaza," it added.
"Shlomo Mansour was murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip."
There was no immediate response to the allegations from Hamas.
Tsachi Idan was taken by Hamas gunmen from his home in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. His eldest child, Maayan - who had just turned 18 - was shot and killed in front of her siblings and parents.
His family said that "the unbearable journey to bring back our beloved and dear Tsachi from the inferno in Gaza has ended with the identification of his body".
Itzik Elgarat was kidnapped from Nir Oz, another kibbutz, and reportedly shot in the hand during the attack.
Ohad Yahalomi, a French-Israeli dual national, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023.
Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour was killed by Hamas at Kibbutz Kissufim on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage.
His sister, Hadassah Lazar, told Israel's Channel 12 that "we've reached an absurd situation where we take comfort in receiving a body to bury". But, she added: "The circle is not yet closed. We will continue fighting until the last hostage returns home."
President Isaac Herzog said: "Together with the entire nation, we share in the immense grief and sorrow of the bereaved families and [their] communities.
"The return of our brothers' bodies from captivity underscores our moral obligation to do everything in our power to bring back all the hostages - the living to their loving families, and the fallen to be late to rest."
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the hostages' families, insisted that Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat could have returned alive if the Israeli government had agreed to the ceasefire deal sooner.
"[They] endured a prolonged period in Hamas captivity in Gaza. They should have returned alive; they could have been saved and brought back through an agreement."
It urged Israel's leaders to ensure the return of the 59 hostages remaining in captivity - 35 of whom are presumed dead - by the start of next week, warning that they "have no time left".
Netanyahu promised Israeli authorities would "act relentlessly until we bring everyone back".
Following the handover of the hostages' bodies, buses carrying Palestinian prisoners were seen leaving Ofer prison in the north of the occupied West Bank and then arriving in Ramallah, where a large crowd gathered to celebrate their release.
"We have been taken out of suffering as if we have been dug out from our own graves. No prisoner has had the experience of having their own release delayed twice," one of the prisoners, Yahya Shrida, told reporters.
"What we have been through is a situation that the mountains can't carry. It is very hard to explain."
Later, dozens more Palestinians were seen getting off buses outside the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.
Many of them said they had endured harsh conditions while in detention.
"During the first period in jail, we were handcuffed and blindfolded for 90 days, you see no-one and no-one sees us. And we used to sit on our knees or on our buttocks for 18 or 20 hours," Eyad al-Saudi said.
He added: "We left behind young detainees, and our joy will not be complete until the remaining detained prisoners are released from prison."
The Israeli military and prison service have previously said that detainees and prisoners are treated in accordance with the law.
The Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said a total of 642 Palestinians in Israeli jails were supposed to be released in the exchange.
Among them were 445 Gazans who were detained by Israeli forces without charge during the war and 46 women and children, it said. The 151 prisoners include dozens convicted of carrying out deadly attacks on Israelis who are being sent abroad.
Israel had delayed the releases since last Saturday in protest at what it said were "Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes".
Hamas said Israel's decision was a "blatant" violation and said indirect talks about further steps in the ceasefire deal were conditional on the prisoners being released.
After days of impasse, Egyptian mediators secured the new exchange, with the Israeli prime minister's office saying the hostages' bodies would be handed over "in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies".
A Hamas official meanwhile said the handover would take place "without public presence to prevent the occupation from finding any pretext for delay or obstruction".
It remains unclear whether the truce will be extended or progress to a planned second phase, which would see the release of all remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.
Indirect negotiations for the second phase were due to start earlier this month but they have not yet got under way.
Hamas affirmed the group's "full commitment to the ceasefire agreement" on Thursday and its "readiness to enter into negotiations for the second phase".
Later, the Israeli prime minister's office said he had "instructed the negotiation delegation to depart for Cairo today to continue the talks", without giving any details.
"Our delegation will go to Cairo and see whether we have a common ground to negotiate," Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters.
"We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more hostages. If it is possible we'll do that."

Text: Israel and Hamas say the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza will be returned on Wednesday night, after mediators resolved the latest ceasefire dispute.
Israel is set to free in exchange 602 Palestinian prisoners, whose release it had delayed since last weekend in protest at what it said was the cruel treatment of hostages being handed over by Hamas.
The Israeli prime minister's office announced the four bodies would be returned "without Hamas ceremonies", while the Israel Prison Service said it was preparing to free prisoners and detainees from Gaza.
Hamas also confirmed the exchange, and the Prisoners' Media Office said a hospital in Gaza was preparing to receive released Palestinians.
This would clear the way for US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to visit the region. He has said he wants Israel and Hamas to begin delayed talks on the second stage of the ceasefire, with the first due to expire on Saturday.
News of the breakthrough came as thousands of Israelis gathered along roads in central and southern Israel to watch the funeral procession of hostages Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, whose bodies were returned by Hamas last week.
They were killed in captivity after being kidnapped during Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has said they were murdered by their captors, rejecting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike.
On Tuesday night, Hamas said a delegation led by the group's Gaza leader, Khalil al-Hayya, had concluded talks with Egyptian officials in Cairo after reaching an agreement to resolve the problem over the delayed release of the Palestinian prisoners.
"They will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli [hostages] agreed to be handed over during the first phase, in addition to the corresponding Palestinian women and children," it added.
Hayya also reiterated that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK, and other countries - was committed to the ceasefire deal "with all its stages and clauses".
Israeli officials also said an agreement had been reached with the mediators, but it was not until Wednesday afternoon that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office put out a brief statement confirming that.
"Four of our deceased hostages will be returned tonight in the framework of the first stage, in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies," it said, without naming them.
The spokesman of Hamas's military wing later announced: "Within the framework of the deal, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades has decided to hand over the bodies of four [hostages] tonight."
He identified them as Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69.
The Israel Prison Service confirmed it was "making preparations for the process of releasing imprisoned terrorists in accordance with the agreement".
Operational units would escort the Palestinian prisoners and detainees to Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank, and Ketziot prison in southern Israel, where they would be identified by the Red Cross and await the handover of the Israeli hostages, a statement said.
Once their release was approved, they would be driven by the Red Cross to release points in the West Bank and the Kerem Shalom crossing with southern Gaza, it added.
The Palestinian Prisoners' Media Office meanwhile said the European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis was preparing to receive those returned to Gaza.
It has previously said the 602 Palestinians include 445 Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war and 50 prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails.
They should have been released last Saturday in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, including Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas.
However, the Israeli prime minister's office said early on Sunday that the release would be postponed "in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes".
Hamas said Israel's decision was a "blatant" violation and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released.
A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase lasting six weeks.
So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released. Both Israel and Hamas have said the last four hostages are dead. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside of the deal.
The agreement has seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to the north, and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day.
The ceasefire's second phase should see the 59 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent ceasefire.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

Headline: 'It'll be a disaster': Uncertainty for thousands forced from West Bank camps by Israeli raids

Text: "The army forced us out. Me, my wife and family. We took nothing with us."
Alaa Ofi is trying to figure out how to manage his drastically changed circumstances.
"We left behind our documents, clothes and everything we had at home."
It's been a month since the Israeli army raided the Tulkarm refugee camp, causing thousands of residents to flee.
At the local Palestinian governor's office we found displaced camp residents looking for assistance.
Some were struggling to find affordable places to rent. Others, like Mr Ofi, needed to retrieve important belongings but had been prevented from returning to their homes by the Israeli army.
"My wife is expecting a baby next week," Mr Ofi said. "I can't take her to hospital because I need insurance papers and my ID, but they were left behind at home."
What Israel is calling "Operation Iron Wall" against Palestinian armed groups has triggered an exodus of around 40,000 people from four camps in the north of the occupied West Bank: Tulkarm, Nur Shams, Jenin and Far'a.
Aid agencies are calling it the largest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank since it was captured by Israeli forces during the 1967 Six Day War.
It's also the first time any of the camps, which were established in the early 1950s for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during Israel's War of Independence, have been almost completely evacuated.
Since the operation began in January, Israeli forces have ploughed up roads and demolished homes.
On the eastern edge of Tulkarm camp, a broad scar is visible where once there were tightly packed houses. Israeli soldiers can be seen patrolling what now looks like a street.
Elsewhere, roads into the camp have been churned up, armoured bulldozers creating piles of earth and pools of muddy rainwater. Pavements and shop fronts have been left mangled.
A concrete UN sign that used to stand over the camp's now impassable main entrance has been knocked down.
At least 51 Palestinians, including seven children, have been killed by Israeli forces in the northern West Bank since the beginning of the operation, according to the UN.
Three soldiers have also been killed by Palestinian gunmen, one of them during an exchange of fire in Jenin and two others in an attack on a checkpoint in Tubas, it says.
The Israeli army says it's tackling Palestinian militant groups, based inside the camps - groups it blames for a string of roadside bomb attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.
On Sunday, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said the army was "at war with Islamic terrorism in Judea and Samaria" - the term Israel uses to describe the West Bank.
He said he had instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) "to prepare for a prolonged stay in the camps that have been cleared for the coming year".
At the same time, Katz ordered tanks to take up positions in Jenin camp and the surrounding city, for the first time in more than 20 years.
Beyond underlining the government's tough message, it's not clear what role the four tanks will perform.
"The IDF is operating within very complex urban environments," a military official said, on condition of anonymity.
"We've done that in Gaza, we've done that in the villages of southern Lebanon," the official said, referring to Israel's wars with Hamas and Hezbollah.
"We're doing that in those neighbourhoods in Judea and Samaria because of the threat that we're facing."
Military officials say there have been no orders to evacuate civilians.
"The IDF has allowed local residents who wish to distance themselves from combat areas to leave safely through designated crossings," the army said in a statement.
But residents of the camps say they were forced to leave, some of them under fire.
Others say instructions to leave were delivered by drone.
One video from Jenin shows a drone flying over the camp, seemingly broadcasting a message.
"Get out of your homes, the army will be here," the message says.
The recently-appointed Palestinian governor of Tulkarm, Dr Abdullah Kmeil, calls Operation Iron Wall "a declaration of war".
"You are talking about an operation of destruction," he told the BBC. "Financial and mental destruction of the residents. These are things the Israelis have planned precisely."
The aim, he says, is to create "a hostile environment" for the camps' residents, in the hope that they leave and are absorbed into the general Palestinian population.
In the meantime, Palestinians find themselves struggling with a host of new difficulties, large and small.
In the village of Qabatiya, just south of Jenin, we found a driver frantically trying to reverse out of a muddy pothole left by Israeli bulldozers that had dug up the street.
His car was stuck in the middle of the road, holding up traffic in both directions.
In the centre of a nearby roundabout, a miniature replica of Jerusalem's iconic Dome of the Rock had been smashed to pieces.
Despite Israel Katz's warning, no-one knows how long the operation, and the restrictions on civilians, will last.
"If we can't go back to our house for a year, it's going to be a disaster," says Alaa Ofi.
"We'll be left stranded in the streets with the kids."

Headline: Israelis pay last respects to hostage mother and sons killed in Gaza

Text: In a display of deep public grief, thousands of Israelis, many with orange balloons and Israeli flags, lined the roads of southern Israel for the funeral procession of three hostages who were killed in captivity in Gaza - Shiri Bibas, and her two red-haired sons, Ariel and Kfir.
Israeli TV channels carried a live feed of the scenes and - after a private burial - the public eulogies by relatives, with crowds gathering to watch on large screens in Tel Aviv's Hostages' Square.
"This trio settled in my heart, and I believe in all of our hearts," a woman called Neta told Channel 12. She said she had come from the north to pay her final respects to the Bibas family at the procession.
"I set out this morning at 04:30. I saw that I couldn't fall asleep, so I headed south. I wanted to come here to be as close as possible to the Gaza border communities, to be part of this farewell."
Kfir, aged nine months, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was the youngest of the 251 hostages snatched in the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks. His brother, Ariel, was just four.
Images of the two boys became among the most recognisable symbols of the struggle to return the hostages.
There was deep anguish in Israel at the sight of Yarden Bibas, Shiri's husband, being released by Hamas at the start of this month without his immediate family.
On Wednesday, Yarden Bibas paid tribute to Shiri, who was 32, as "the most amazing wife and mother", saying he would always love her.
"I want to tell you everything that's happening in the world and here in Israel," he went on. "Shiri, everyone knows us and loves us. You have no idea how surreal this madness is."
Wearing an orange kippah, or skullcap, he shared touching memories of his children and spoke of how he and his wife had been happily surprised on giving birth to their second red-headed boy.
The Israeli president's residence was lit up in orange - the colour that has come to represent the family.
At the procession's start, the Bibas family thanked Israelis for their show of support and expressed longing for days "when we can once again gather in moments of joy, not sorrow".
Wrapped in an orange flag to watch the convoy of cars passing en route to the cemetery, Shontal expressed sympathy with the bereaved.
"I wanted to come and be close to them, to offer my condolences to Yarden and the family. I hope he manages to recover - not only from the captivity he endured but also from grasping and understanding this terrible tragedy," she told Channel 12. "His tragedy is all of ours."
A haunting video of Shiri Bibas was filmed during the Hamas assault in southern Israel over 16 months ago.
She appears terrified as she clutches onto her children surrounded by armed men before they are taken away from their home. Hours later, surveillance camera footage showed them in Khan Younis.
In November 2023, Hamas said that an Israeli air strike in Gaza had killed Shiri and her sons. However, that was never verified by the Israeli military, which only expressed "serious concern" for them.
As recently as last week, the Bibas family continued to hold out hope that the mother and her sons could be returned to Israel alive. They asked the public to "refrain from eulogising our loved ones" until a government post-mortem examination was completed.
Then, last Friday, after the first handover of the remains of dead hostages by Hamas since its deadly 2023 attack, under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal, news came through that devastated many Israelis.
The Bibas boys were dead, their identities confirmed by DNA tests. The Israeli military spokesman said pathological exams and intelligence showed they had been murdered by their captors "with their bare hands".
In addition, the remains of Shiri Bibas were not found in the coffin labelled with her name that had been handed to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
This was said to contain the remains of a Palestinian woman from Gaza instead. Hamas suggested that there may have been a mix up in the aftermath of the Israeli bombardment.
Two days later, the Bibas family announced that Shiri's body had been returned to Israel and that she too had been murdered in captivity.
The upsetting confusion over the bodies, along with the grim handover ceremony for the dead hostages staged by Hamas, were among what Israel said were truce violations, leading it to postpone the agreed release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners last Saturday.
Hamas responded that this was a "serious violation" by Israel which threw the ceasefire process into a new crisis.
Hours before the funeral, Israeli and Hamas officials said the crisis had been resolved by mediators, with the bodies of another four Israeli hostages now expected to be returned later on Wednesday or on Thursday at the same time as the Palestinian prisoners are freed.
However, the fallout triggered fresh anxiety for the relatives of some 60 remaining hostages who remain unsure if their loved ones - or their bodies - will ever be returned from Gaza.
A pledge by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avenge the Bibas family's deaths only increased their relatives' worries.
The family have criticised the Israeli media and Netanyahu for ignoring their wishes not to release more details of the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths.
In a Facebook post on the eve of the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy, the sister of Yarden Bibas, told the prime minister to "shut up" after he repeatedly described the murders. She said publication of the information was "outright abuse of a family that has gone through 16 months of hell and still has the worst ahead".
The Bibas funeral came a day after that of Oded Lifshitz, who was also from Nir Oz and was 83 when he was abducted. His body was also returned last week. Netanyahu has said he was murdered in captivity by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Shiri Bibas and her children were buried in a single casket next to the final resting place of her parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, who lived in the same kibbutz and were killed there on 7 October.
In total, some 1,200 people were killed on Israel's deadliest ever day. It ignited the deadliest ever war in Gaza, in which more than 48,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
At the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy called on Israeli officials seeking forgiveness for their failure to protect Shiri, Ariel and Kfir that day to instead hold themselves accountable.
"Forgiveness means accepting responsibility and committing to act differently, to learn from mistakes. There is no meaning to forgiveness before the failures are investigated, and all officials take responsibility.
"Our disaster as a nation and as a family should not have happened, and must never happen again."

Headline: 'We are still at war': Syria's Kurds battle Turkey months after Assad's fall
Author: Jiyar Gol, BBC Persian

Text: To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.
This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.
But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain.
As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.
A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.
IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.
Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.
At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).
As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.
But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.
For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. "Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane," says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. "It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it."
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.
Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.
Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.
As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.
Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: "Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege."
In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.
Newrouz Ahmad says that having "defeated IS in Kobane… we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too".
At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. "I am 60," he says.
It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.
And now the threat of another battle is looming.
Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.
In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.
She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.
The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing. The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.
"An old man next to me was also injured," she tells me from her bed.
"I lost some blood… but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance," she adds.
Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an "apparent war crime" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.
The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that "reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a "conflict-ridden area on purpose" to use them as "human shields… in order to not to lose control on the said dam".
It accused the SDF of using "violence and terror" to pursue "its own separatist agenda", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.
Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.
The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.
But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies – Turkey.
And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.
Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.
But the two sides have still not reached an agreement.
"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us," he says, adding: "In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.
"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights," he says.
For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.
Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.
But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.
It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.
"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces," he warns. "That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters."
There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.
The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.
"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership," she says. "Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?"
Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.
"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?" she asks.
So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?

Headline: Six babies have died from cold in Gaza over two weeks, medics say

Text: At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say.
Doctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition.
The family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight.
The PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters.
The Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago. Israel has denied this.
Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times during the 16-month war between Israel and Hamas and almost 70% of buildings in the territory are estimated to be damaged or destroyed.
The healthcare system has also collapsed, with only 18 of the 35 hospitals partially functional and shortages of essential medical equipment.
According to meteorological websites, the night-time temperature in Gaza has regularly fallen below 10C (50F) over the past two weeks.
It dropped to 3C (37F) on Monday night, after the PFBS hospital's medical director Dr Saeed Salah had warned in a video that three babies suffering from cold injuries, including hypothermia, had died over the same period.
He said the babies were only one or two days old, and had weighed between 1.7kg and 2kg (3.7-4.4lbs).
On Tuesday, Dr Salah and a paediatrician at the hospital, Dr Samer Lubad, reported that another two newborns had died.
"The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with case that they call 'cold injury' or hypothermia," Dr Lubad told Al Jazeera TV.
"Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home. There is still one baby in our neonatal ICU in a critical general condition."
He added: "Of course, this condition is because of the cold weather and lack of safe shelters, lack of central heating, and lack of electricity in the Gaza Strip."
Meanwhile, the head of the paediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis told the Associated Press that it had received the body of a two-month-old girl who had died of hypothermia on Tuesday.
A video posted by a local journalist appeared to show the girl being buried by her father and uncle, who said she was named Sham Yousef al-Shambari.
He said she had been healthy and that her mother had found her "stiff as wood from the cold" when she tried to wake her for feeding during the night inside the family's tent in the al-Mawasi area.
Dr Muneer al-Boursh, director general of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said in a statement a total of 15 children had died due to the cold since the start of the winter.
He also alleged that Israel had "failed to comply with humanitarian protocols, including allowing the entry of medical equipment, heating supplies, tents, and mobile homes" since the ceasefire began on 19 January.
Hamas has previously said that Israel was required to allow in about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans during the six-week-long first phase of the deal.
Israeli military body Cogat said Israel was "committed to and complies with the obligation to allow the entry of 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks per week" into Gaza, including those carrying tents and shelter supplies.
"Based on the data available to us, hundreds of thousands of tents have entered the Gaza Strip since the agreement came into effect," it added.
It comes amid continued uncertainty over whether the ceasefire will continue past Saturday, when the deal's first phase is set to expire.
On Sunday, Israel postponed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for 10 hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, accusing the group of cynically using its hostages for propaganda purposes.
Hamas accused Israel of a "blatant" violation of the deal and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

Headline: Syrian leader hails 'historic' dialogue conference

Text: Syria's interim president has told a national dialogue conference that the country has a "historic" opportunity to rebuild after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.
Ahmed al-Sharaa also stressed the need for armed groups to integrate into the military and for the state to have a monopoly on weapons, saying Syria's "strength lies in its unity".
The 600 delegates have been asked to provide recommendations on transitional justice, the economy, the new constitution and other topics to guide a new transitional government.
But there has been criticism that the process has been rushed, and the Kurdish-led militia alliance and autonomous administration which control north-eastern Syria were not invited.
The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist, with Bashar becoming president in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez.
In 2011, Bashar brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.
On 8 December, he fled to Russia after a rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept down from north-western Syria and entered Damascus in the space of only 12 days.
Seven weeks later, Sharaa was named president for the "transitional period" by his fellow rebel commanders. They also announced the cancellation of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, army and security agencies, and the integration of all rebel groups into the new state institutions replacing them.
Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to discuss Syria's future, which he said would be followed by a "constitutional declaration" to serve during the transition.
"Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it to build itself on its own," Sharaa said in a speech at the national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday.
"What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country."
The organising committee said six working groups would be formed to discuss a transitional justice system, the new constitution, reforming and building state institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society, and the country's future economic model.
The groups would agree non-binding recommendations, which would be presented to the new transitional government set to take power on Saturday and help shape the constitutional declaration, according to the committee.
Sharaa said a transitional justice body would soon be formed to "restore people's rights" and start holding to account those who committed crimes against Syrians during the civil war.
He also reiterated that non-state armed groups had to disarm and hand over their territory.
"The unity of arms and their monopoly by the state is not a luxury but a duty and an obligation," he said. "Syria is indivisible; it is a complete whole, and its strength lies in its unity."
The interim government's forces control Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by various armed groups.
They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance supported by the US, which controls most of the north-east and serves as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES).
The SDF has so far refused to integrate its forces into the new Syrian army, although negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks.
Organisers of the conference said the SDF and AANES had not been invited because of that refusal, and that Kurds would be represented in Damascus even if they were not.
However, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami told AFP news agency that "the exclusion of the SDF and large sections of Syrian society confirm that the conference serves to please the outside world and not to seek a better future".
Thirty-five parties in the AANES also criticised what they claimed was the "token representation" of Kurds and other minorities, saying such events were "meaningless, worthless, and will not contribute to finding real solutions to the country's ongoing crisis".
Moutasem Sioufi of The Day After, an independent civil society group that is participating in the conference, told the BBC that it was important that all groups were involved.
"We need to have dialogue with all the Syrian groups, with all Syrian powers, especially those who have great influence on the ground. Without that Syria would face a very hard time maintaining itself together," he said.
The outcomes of the conference will be closely watched by the international community, which has called for an inclusive political process that represents the country's many ethnic and religious communities.
During the civil war, the US, the UK, and the European Union imposed a wide range of sanctions on Syria targeting Assad's government and its allies in response to atrocities committed during the civil war.
They have lifted some of the sanctions that crippled the Syrian economy since Assad's fall, but made further steps dependent on Syria's new leaders keeping promises to respect minority rights and move towards democracy.
On Monday, the EU announced that it was suspending sanctions on its energy, transport and banking sectors to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction.
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani welcomed that decision, but he criticised the international sanctions still in place in a speech to the national dialogue conference.
"These sanctions are illegitimate and are not based on any legal or moral foundations," he said. "They are being used as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people."
HTS, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, is subject to separate sanctions because it continues to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK.

Headline: Israel demands complete demilitarisation of southern Syria

Text: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the complete demilitarisation of much of southern Syria.
It is an announcement that could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria, after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, more likely.
In a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to "enter the area south of Damascus".
"We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime," he added. "Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria."
He also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy.
Until now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side.
The rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum.
But with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger.
Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so in 2019.
Syria's new interim President, HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, has tried to reassure Israel that he does not want conflict and that he is ready to uphold the long-standing disengagement agreement between the two countries concluded after another war in 1973.
He has also stressed that he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks against Israel.
But Sharaa has also called on Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it has taken, as he tries to assert sovereignty across the whole of Syria's fractured landscape.
Clearly, Netanyahu does not trust these assurances.
Like much of the international community, the Israeli prime minister is waiting to see if Sharaa makes good on his moderate, emollient stance in action as well as words.
From the perspective of the new Syrian leadership, freeing the country from the influence of all the foreign powers that jockeyed for position during the long years of civil war is seen as vital to ensuring a more positive future for the country and a definitive break with the past.
Some foreign players, such as Iran and Russia, have seen for now at least the curtailment of the overweening influence they once had.
Under President Donald Trump, the US might also further disengage from Syria - a role which has helped underpin Kurdish-led forces in the north-east of the country.
There has, though, been growing influence from Turkey - which provided essential support for HTS in its lightning campaign against Assad.
How big a part it chooses to play could be a determining factor in how Syria develops in the post-Assad era.
But Israel may present a more immediate challenge to the independence of Syria's new leadership.
To have Israeli troops increasingly infringing on the country's territory - as well as carrying out numerous strikes on targets associated with what's left of Assad's military arsenal - does not fit with the vision of a re-unified, sovereign state that Sharaa is trying to convince Syrians both inside and outside the country that his leadership can provide.
Netanyahu's move to forbid Syrian forces from operating freely within the country's borders may be a step too far for the new order in Damascus to stomach, however non-confrontational an image it is trying to maintain.

Headline: Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners

Text: Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed.
Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including "humiliating" handover ceremonies.
A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to "grave danger" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel.
The deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun.
UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was "precarious" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs.
He also called for the "dignified release of all remaining hostages".
On Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages.
As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel.
Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a "sickening display of cruelty".
There was already fury in Israel after Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.
It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day.
Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys "with their bare hands", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike.
Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails.
They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers.
In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed "in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes".
"It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies."
Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a "blatant violation" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released.
"We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released," Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday.
Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that "all options are on the table".
"Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen]," he added.
"Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?"
Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released.
The White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an "appropriate response" to what it called the "barbaric treatment" of hostages by Hamas.
But President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting "an extension of phase one".
"We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released," he told CNN on Sunday.
A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase.
So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal.
The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day.
The ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

Headline: The unseen map that promised to bring peace to the Middle East
Author: Paul Adams, Diplomatic correspondent
Published Date: 2025-02-24T01:04:43.214Z
Text: "In the next 50 years, you will not find one Israeli leader that will propose to you what I propose to you now.
"Sign it! Sign it and let's change history!"
It was 2008. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was imploring the Palestinian leader to accept a deal he believed could have brought peace to the Middle East.
It was a two-state solution - a prospect which seems impossible today.
If implemented, it would have created a Palestinian state on more than 94% of the occupied West Bank.
The map Olmert had drawn up now has an almost mythical status. Various interpretations have appeared over the years, but he has never revealed it to the media.
Until now.
In Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October, the latest series from documentary filmmaker Norma Percy available on iPlayer from Monday, Olmert reveals the map he says he showed to Mahmoud Abbas at a meeting in Jerusalem on 16 September 2008.
"This is the first time that I expose this map to the media," he tells the filmmakers.
It shows, in detail, the territory which Olmert proposed to annexe to Israel - 4.9% of the West Bank.
That would have included major Jewish settlement blocs - just like previous proposals dating back to the late 1990s.
In return, the prime minister said Israel would give up an equal amount of Israeli territory, along the edges of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The two Palestinian territories would be connected via a tunnel or highway – again, something that had been discussed before.
In the film, Olmert recalls the Palestinian leader's response.
"He said: 'Prime minister, this is very serious. It is very, very, very serious.'"
Crucially, Olmert's plan included a proposed solution to the thorny issue of Jerusalem.
Each side would be able to claim parts of the city as their capital, while administration of the "holy basin" - including the Old City, with its religious sites, and adjacent areas - would be handed over to a committee of trustees consisting of Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the US.
The implications of the map, for Jewish settlements, would have been colossal.
Had the plan been implemented, dozens of communities, scattered throughout the West Bank and Jordan Valley, would have been evacuated.
When the previous Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, forcibly removed a few thousand Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was regarded as a national trauma by those on the Israeli right.
Evacuating most of the West Bank would have represented an infinitely greater challenge, involving tens of thousands of settlers, with the very real danger of violence.
But the test never came.
At the end of their meeting, Olmert refused to hand over a copy of the map to Mahmoud Abbas unless the Palestinian leader sign it.
Abbas refused, saying that he needed to show his experts the map, to make sure they understood exactly what was being offered.
Olmert says the two agreed to a meeting of map experts the following day.
"We parted, you know, like we are about to embark on a historic step forward," Olmert says.
The meeting never happened. As they drove away from Jerusalem that night, President Abbas's chief of staff, Rafiq Husseini, remembers the atmosphere in the car.
"Of course, we laughed," he says in the film.
The Palestinians believed the plan was dead in the water. Olmert, embroiled in an unrelated corruption scandal, had already announced that he was planning to resign.
"It is unfortunate that Olmert, regardless of how nice he was… was a lame duck," Husseini says, "and therefore, we will go nowhere with this."
The situation in Gaza also complicated matters. After months of rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory, Olmert ordered a major Israeli assault, Operation Cast Lead, at the end of December, triggering three weeks of intense fighting.
But Olmert tells me it would have been "very smart" for Abbas to sign the deal. Then, if a future Israeli prime minister tried to cancel it, "he could have said to the world that the failure was Israel's fault".
Israeli elections followed in February. Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, a vocal opponent of Palestinian statehood, became prime minister.
Olmert's plan, and map, faded from view.
The former prime minister says he's still waiting for Abbas's reply, but his plan has since joined a long list of missed opportunities to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In 1973, the former Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, quipped that the Palestinians "never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity". It's a phrase that Israeli officials have frequently repeated in the years since.
But the world is more complicated than that, especially since the two sides signed the historic Oslo Accords in 1993.
The peace process ushered in by a handshake on the White House lawn between former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had moments of genuine hope, punctuated by tragedy. Ultimately, it resulted in failure.
The reasons are complex and there's plenty of blame to go around but in truth, the stars were never properly aligned.
I witnessed this non-alignment at first hand 24 years ago.
In January 2001, at the Egyptian resort of Taba, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators once again saw the outlines of a deal.
A member of the Palestinian delegation drew a rough map on a napkin and told me that, for the first time, they were looking at the rough outlines of a viable Palestinian state.
But the talks were irrelevant, drowned out by the violence raging on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza, where the second Palestinian uprising, or "intifada", had erupted the previous September.
Once again, Israel was in the midst of a political transition. Prime Minister Ehud Barak had already resigned. Ariel Sharon comfortably defeated him a few weeks later.
The map on the napkin, just like Olmert's map eight years later, showed what might have been.

Headline: Huge crowds gather for Hezbollah leader Nasrallah's funeral

Text: Large crowds have gathered for the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut in September.
Mourners dressed in black flocked to a stadium on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital on Sunday. They also paid their respects to Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, who was killed in a separate Israeli strike before he could assume his post.
Nasrallah, the former leader of the Lebanese militant Shia Islamist group, was one of the most influential figures in the Middle East.
Hours before the funeral began at 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT), Israel launched air strikes in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers.
People braved the cold to attend the funeral, which was held at the 50,000-capacity Camille Chamoun Sports City stadium.
Nasrallah's coffin was draped in Hezbollah's flag and paraded along with Safieddine's casket through huge crowds of black-clad mourners.
Excerpts of Nasrallah's speeches were played to the gathered supporters, who chanted, waved flags and held portraits of the leaders.
Hezbollah's current leader, Naim Qassem, addressed mourners via video link from an undisclosed location, saying Hezbollah remained "strong" and "would not submit".
One mourner, 55-year-old Umm Mahdi, told the AFP news agency that the funeral was the "least we can do" for Nasrallah, "who gave up everything" for his cause.
Prior to his death, he had not been seen in public for years because of fears of being assassinated by Israel.
The late leader had close personal links to Iran and played a key role in turning Hezbollah into the political and military force it is today. He was revered by the group's supporters.
Under Nasrallah's 30-year leadership, Hezbollah - which is banned as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and other countries - helped train fighters from the Palestinian armed group Hamas, as well as militias in Iraq and Yemen, and obtained missiles and rockets from Iran for use against Israel.
He died aged 64 in Dahieh, a closely-guarded suburb of Beirut. After Nasrallah's death, Hezbollah allowed open access to the area for the first time for a public memorial.
The mass funeral is an apparent show of strength for Hezbollah, which suffered a series of major setbacks during Israel's campaign in Lebanon last year.
Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that Israeli planes were flying over the stadium while the funeral took place to "convey a clear message: whoever threatens to destroy Israel - that will be the end of them".
Israel's incursion into Lebanon came after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza.
Lebanon was subject to an intense Israeli air campaign and a ground invasion of the country's south.
Dozens of senior figures were killed when Israeli-made walkie-talkies were detonated in a surprise attack in September 2024.
Many of Hezbollah's most senior military and political leaders were also killed during the latest conflict with Israel.
The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to more than 1.2 million residents being displaced before a ceasefire deal was struck in November.
Representatives from Iran, Iraq and Yemen attended the funeral, which was delayed to allow time for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon - though some troops still remain.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the slain leaders as "two heroes of the resistance" in a speech.

Headline: Israel expels residents of three West Bank refugee camps

Text: Israel has expelled the residents of three refugee camps in the occupied West Bank as it steps up a major month-long operation in the Palestinian territory.
Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said the camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams were now "empty" and would be occupied by the Israeli military for the coming year.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has deployed a tank division around the city of Jenin - the first time it has done so since 2002. The Palestinian Authority condemned the move.
The UN said earlier this month that Israel's operation, which began on 21 January and was intensified in recent days, had led to the "forced displacement" of 40,000 people.
"So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams, which are now empty of residents," Israel Katz said in a statement.
"I have instructed [troops] to prepare for a prolonged presence in the cleared camps for the coming year and to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism."
He also said that Israel had instructed the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) to stop operating in the area.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described the decision to deploy tanks as a "dangerous Israeli escalation that will not lead to stability or calm".
The IDF said in a statement that its forces are "continuing the operation to thwart terrorism" and are expanding their "offensive activity" - which so far has involved drones, tanks, special forces, border police, and operatives from the intelligence agency Shin Bet.
The UN said on Thursday that since Israeli operations began on 21 January, 51 Palestinians, including seven children, have been killed in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas governorates, as well as three Israeli soldiers.
The offensive has caused severe damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, disrupting access to water to "tens of thousands of people", it said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Tulkarm refugee camp on Friday and ordered the army to intensify "operational activity", his office said.
"We are entering terrorist strongholds, flattening entire streets that terrorists use, and their homes. We are eliminating terrorists, commanders," Netanyahu said.
His visit followed the explosion of three buses in Tel Aviv, which Israeli officials described as a "suspected terror attack" that was caused by bombs of the kind previously found in the West Bank.
Israel occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Six Day War and has since built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.

Text: As the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is meant to be drawing to an end, it has once again been put in doubt.
After the last six living Israel hostages due to be released in this phase were freed, more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were due to be released by Israel in exchange - the biggest number so far to be freed in one go.
But that has now been delayed indefinitely by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with his demand that Hamas must stop what he called its "cynical use of hostages for propaganda purposes". Hamas has in turn accused Israel of deliberately trying to disrupt the ceasefire agreement.
It's the latest big bump in the road that's intended ultimately to lead to a permanent end to hostilities and the start of rebuilding Gaza.
Israel complained about the chaotic scenes in one of the first handovers, saying the physical safety of the hostages had been put in jeopardy. Then, Israel said Hamas had broken the terms of the agreement by not releasing a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehud.
In response, it delayed opening access for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza for 48 hours. That was resolved when Arbel Yehud was freed in an extra handover before the next scheduled for the following Saturday.
Hamas later accused Israel of not living up to its commitments to permit heavy machinery, tents and caravans into Gaza. It then said it would not carry out the next hostage handover as scheduled.
That prompted threats from both Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump that all out war would resume in Gaza if the hostages weren't freed as agreed. With the clock ticking down, Hamas agreed to release them.
And just in the past few days, the discovery that the body Hamas handed over on Thursday as that of Shiri Bibas turned out not to be her. That set off new anger and shock in Israel, where the images of Shiri trying to shield her two young children as they were abducted on 7 October, 2023, is seen as the most potent symbol of the horror of that day.
Netanyahu denounced Hamas for what he called a "cruel and evil violation" of the agreement. Once again, the ceasefire was kept on track only at the last moment by Hamas providing another body within a day that this time did indeed prove to be hers.
All these incidents have shown how fragile the ceasefire process remains. They may also have contributed to the fact talks on the second phase - due to start earlier this month - have not yet got under way. Time is running out, with the first phase due to end in a week's time.
Hamas has offered to release the remaining hostages due to be freed in the second phase in one go, but only if Israel pulls all its forces out of Gaza and there is a permanent end to the war.
Israel has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas, which it has so far rejected. The stage-managed ceremonies at each hostage handover, which Netanyahu has so strongly condemned, are intended to show it is still a force to be reckoned with in Gaza.
In Israel, voices on the right demand the government resumes its war against Hamas, while the families of the hostages - backed by much of Israel - say securing the release of the remaining hostages is what matters above and beyond all else.
Trump's plan for Gaza has brought new uncertainty into the equation. The third phase of the ceasefire is meant to set Gaza on the path towards reconstruction and renewal.
Arab states are hurriedly trying to come up with a concrete alternative proposal in which Palestinians would continue to live in Gaza while it is rebuilt, rather than being removed from the enclave as envisaged in Trump's plan.
The future governance of Gaza also remains a key sticking point, with Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries all so far appearing to have contradictory proposals.
These issues will require difficult negotiations, which will be conducted amid the constant risk of a return to war, for which some on both sides continue to advocate.
But for now, the mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US may have their work cut out just getting the first phase of the ceasefire over the line.

Text: Israel says it is indefinitely delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners, in another potentially major setback in the ceasefire process.
Benjamin Netanyahu said the release was now going to be delayed until the next handover of hostages by Hamas was guaranteed - and without what the Israeli prime minister called the degrading ceremonies Hamas has put on each week.
Only one more handover - of the bodies of four hostages who died in captivity - is due to take place in the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is due to end on 1 March.
No arrangements for the release of other living hostages, due to take place in the second phase, have yet been made.
Delegations from Israel and Hamas were due to negotiate the exact terms of the second phase while the first was ongoing - but have yet to meet.
Mediators will be working overtime to get the deal back on track and avert a possible collapse, after both Israel and Hamas accused one another of breaking the terms of the agreement.
Netanyahu accused Hamas of "repeated violations", including the "cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes".
In response, Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq strongly condemned the decision to postpone the release of the prisoners in a statement on Sunday morning.
He said that Israel's claim that the handover ceremonies were humiliating was a "false claim and a flimsy argument" aimed at evading its obligations under the ceasefire agreement.
Netanyahu's statement came after four hostages taken captive on 7 October - Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen and Omer Wenkert - were released on Saturday.
The two other released hostages, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, were held in Gaza for years - Mr Mengistu since 2014 and Mr al-Sayed since 2015.
In exchange, Israel was supposed to release 602 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement by delaying the release.
The six Israeli hostages are the final living hostages to be returned as part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement.
Meanwhile, outside the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, family and friends waited for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
According to Palestinian authorities, 50 prisoners who were going to be released were serving life sentences, 60 had long sentences, and 445 were detained by Israel since 7 October.
There are 62 hostages taken on 7 October 2023 still being held by Hamas, about half of whom are believed to be alive.
Hamas began releasing hostages, facilitated by the Red Cross, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners after the ceasefire agreement took effect on 19 January.
Initial chaotic scenes have become more choreographed, with hostages flanked by fighters on stages before the handovers.
On Saturday, Mr Shoham, 40, and Mr Mengistu, 39, were passed to the Red Cross in Rafah in southern Gaza before being transferred to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Mr Shoham was visiting family at Kibbutz Be'eri in October 2023 when he and others, including his wife and two children, were kidnapped by Hamas. His captured family members were released after 50 days.
In a statement, his family said: "This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us."
Mr Mengistu, who is Ethiopian-Israeli, had been held by Hamas since September 2014 when he crossed into northern Gaza.
He and Mr al-Sayed, a Bedouin Arab Israeli who entered Gaza in 2015, had both suffered with mental health problems in the past, according to their families.
Mr al-Sayed's release was conducted privately in Gaza City on Saturday.
"After nearly a decade of fighting for Hisham's return, the long-awaited moment has arrived," his family said in a statement.
"During these days, we need privacy for Hisham and the entire family so we can begin to care for Hisham and ourselves."
Separately, at Nuseirat in central Gaza, Mr Shem Tov, 22, Mr Cohen, 27, and Mr Wenkert, 23, were freed in another public show by Hamas.
All three were taken captive at the Nova music festival.
Mr Shem Tov had initially escaped by car when Hamas fighters descended on the festival, but was captured when he went back to rescue his friends.
Mr Cohen had hidden with girlfriend Ziv Abud in a shelter at the festival, but was found and driven away. The shelter was bombed, but Ms Abud survived and escaped.
Mr Wenkert managed to send text messages to his family when festival-goers were being attacked, to tell them he was going to a safe shelter, but they lost contact with him.
Crowds in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square greeted the public releases with cheers as they watched them unfold on a live feed.
Families celebrating the return of the six men called for all remaining hostages to be released.
"Our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will... return all hostages home," Mr Shoham's family said.
Remaining hostages include Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier captured on 7 October.
His mother, Yael Alexander, who was watching Saturday's hostage release, told the BBC it was "amazing" to see them freed, but for her family it is "very tough" waiting.
"There are more than dozens of young men alive, like my son, still waiting to be released," she said. "This is the main goal, to release the live people now from Gaza."
Saturday's joyful scenes contrasted with earlier this week, when the bodies of hostages Shiri Bibas, her two young sons and another captive Oded Lifschitz were returned to Israel.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages.
Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Text: Israel's forensic officials have confirmed a body handed over by Hamas on Friday is that of hostage Shiri Bibas - but have rejected Hamas's claim that she was killed by Israeli bombing.
Dr Chen Kugel, director of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said an examination found "no evidence of injuries caused by bombing".
On Friday, Israel said that the two children of Shiri Bibas - Ariel and Kfir - had been killed with "bare hands" and that evidence of this had been sent to Israel's partners around the world. The BBC has not seen or verified this evidence.
Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence.
"Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home," the Bibas family said in a statement.
The remains of Ariel, Kfir and another hostage, Oded Lifschitz, were handed over by Hamas on Thursday - alongside a fourth body which it said was that of Shiri Bibas. Israel's forensic testing then showed that these remains were in fact of a different unidentified woman.
Hamas spokesman Ismail al-Thawabta said in a post on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after the air strike.
Hamas released the correct remains on Friday evening.
The Bibas family said: "For 16 months, we sought certainty, and now that we have it, there is no comfort in it, but we hope for the beginning of a closure."
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press conference "forensic findings", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested Ariel and Kfir had been killed "deliberately".
He said evidence had been shared with "partners around the world so they can verify it".
Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months respectively when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.
They were taken hostage along with the children's father, Yarden Bibas, 34, who was released alive by Hamas on 1 February.
Under the first phase of a ceasefire deal, which began on 19 January and lasts for 42 days, Hamas agreed to hand over 33 hostages in return for Israel freeing 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.
On Saturday, the armed group released Eliya Cohen, 27, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shohan, 40, and 23-year-old Omer Wenkert - all of whom were taken during the 7 October attacks.
Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengitsu, who was captured by Hamas in 2014, was also released. Hisham al-Sayed, a Bedouin Arab-Israeli held in Gaza since 2015, was handed over separately. Israel is due to free 602 Palestinian prisoners.
In subsequent stages of the agreement, Hamas will release the remaining living hostages from Gaza and return the bodies of dead hostages. Israel has pledged to release more Palestinian prisoners.
In the 7 October attacks, about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages.
In response, Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

Text: Six Israeli hostages are now back in Israel after being handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza.
Avera Mengistu and Tal Shoham were freed by Hamas on Saturday morning, in a highly-choreographed event in Rafah.
Hours later, in Nuseirat, Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov and Omer Wenkert were handed over amid similar scenes.
Hisham al-Sayed was released shortly after in Gaza City.
Mengistu and al-Sayed were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively, after they crossed into Gaza on their own.
The others were kidnapped in 7 October 2023, during Hamas' attacks on Israel.
In exchange for their release, Israel is set to free 602 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, according to the Palestinian prisoners' media office.

Text: Israel has said Israeli children Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who were taken hostage on 7 October 2023, were "deliberately" killed by their captors in Gaza.
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said "forensic findings", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested the boys had been killed with "bare hands".
He said evidence had been shared with Israel's "partners around the world so they can verify it".
Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence.
The bodies of the two boys were returned to Israel on Thursday, alongside the body of another hostage, Oded Lifschitz. Hamas said a fourth body handed over was that of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas - but Israel said forensic testing showed it was not her.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged Hamas "put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin" instead of the body of Shiri Bibas.
The IDF posted on X that "during the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body."
"This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organisation, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages."
A Hamas spokesman, Ismail al-Thawabta, said on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under the rubble of a structure after an Israeli air strike.
The group told Reuters news agency they would investigate what had led to the wrong remains being sent to Israel.
Israel demanded that Hamas return Shiri along with the other remaining hostages.
"Whether she is alive or not, they need to bring back Shiri Bibas," IDF international spokesperson Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
Netanyahu said "we will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages - both living and dead - and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement".
In a statement, Hamas said it affirmed its "seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations" and had no interest in "non-compliance".
Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.
They have become a symbol for many in Israel and the news that their bodies would be returned to Israel was met with an outpouring of grief.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it was "horrified and devastated" that Shiri had not been returned, "despite the agreement and our desperate hopes".
The children's father Yarden Bibas, 34, was released by Hamas on 1 February.
Israel has confirmed that the fourth body returned on Thursday was that of veteran peace activist, Oded Lifschitz.
The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January, and Israel has confirmed it expects eight bodies will be handed over.
The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire.
Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month, but have not yet begun.
Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged.
Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Also on Thursday, three buses exploded in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, in what Israeli police said is a suspected terror attack.
Devices in two other buses failed to explode, they said. No casualties were reported.
In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced he had ordered the IDF to carry out an "intensive operation against centers of terrorism" in the West Bank.

Text: Kfir and Ariel Bibas were last seen on 7 October with their mother Shiri's hands around them, holding onto her boys surrounded by gunmen and violence, trying to protect them. She couldn't.
According to the Israeli army, Kfir and Ariel's last moments were at the "bare hands" of their captors.
How do you eulogise children who have barely lived their lives?
Kfir Bibas, a hostage at just nine months old, did not live to take his first steps or celebrate his first birthday.
Ariel Bibas had only experienced four years of a life that should have been much longer.
A statement from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the boys were taken hostage from, described Kfir as "a calm and smiley baby, with ginger hair and a laugh that would make anyone's heart melt. Wherever he went he lit it up with his smile and joy."
Ariel, they said, was "a playful boy with ginger hair, curious eyes and a big smile. He loved superheroes, tractors and cars, and ran non-stop, climbing and exploring the world."
The two brothers became the greatest symbol of the hostage nightmare Israelis are enduring. Bringing home the Bibas family was a country's fervent hope.
Throughout the last 16 months they have been remembered, prayed for, kept in the hearts of people, not just in Israel but by Jews and others across the world.
Images were shared of the boys in their Batman costumes with Ariel's cape flying in the wind; of older brother Ariel hugging his baby brother Kfir when he was born; of Kfir giggling and gurgling as his father Yarden played with him.
And then the image seared into the minds since Hamas's attack on 7 October: the boys clutching onto their mother Shiri Bibas, her face tormented in fear, as they were surrounded by gunmen and taken to Gaza.
No one in Israel wanted this ending; where Kfir and Ariel returned, not to their innocent childhood, but with their tender years already over. And where their mother who protected them until the last moment has not even returned with them.
In Israel, there is communal pain and grief.
In a video statement, the Israeli Prime Minister said Ariel and Kfir Bibas and 84-year-old Oded Lifschitz, whose body was also returned on Thursday, were "brutally murdered by Hamas savages."
Holding up a picture of the boys, Benjamin Netanyahu said: "Today is a tragic day. It's a day of boundless sorrow, of indescribable pain.
"Their bodies return home to a nation in mourning. A nation that will never forget and never forgive the evil that cut down these beautiful souls…The Bibas children in particular became the symbol of who we are, and who we're fighting against."
Netanyahu said: "Who kidnaps a little boy and a baby and murders them? Monsters. That's who."
Israel's President Isaac Herzog said in a statement: "Agony. Pain. Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters." He asked for forgiveness on behalf of the country for not protecting them and bringing them home.
Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the 7 October attacks.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attacks and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
This week, in Israel and abroad, people across social media posted images of broken orange hearts to represent the boys with the striking ginger hair.
On Thursday, as the vehicles with the bodies of the Bibas children and Oded Lifschitz crossed into Israel, people lining the streets with Israeli flags shouted out "sorry".
In October 2023 just weeks after they were kidnapped, the aunt of the Bibas brothers spoke to the BBC.
Ofri Bibas Levy described how Kfir had just started crawling and eating solid food.
"They are civilians and are not supposed to be there. The longer they are there the harder it's going to be to recover them and the less chance they're going to come out alive," she said.
On Friday she wrote on Facebook: "I'm sorry Luli [Ariel], I'm sorry Firfir [Kfir].
"You did not deserve any of this. We will miss you forever. We are not giving up on your mum Shiri."
In a video statement she added: "Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were taken alive by a murderous terrorist organization, and it was Israel's responsibility and obligation to bring them back alive.
"There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7 and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment. For Ariel and Kfir's sake, and for Yarden's sake, we are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri."
Yarden Bibas, who was only recently released as a hostage, must now bury his two young boys, with his wife Shiri still not returned by Hamas.
In Israel they are quoting words that painfully resonate: "The smallest coffins are the heaviest."

Text: Israel's announcement that a body returned from Gaza on Thursday was not that of Shiri Bibas, as Hamas had said, throws up another stumbling block in this ceasefire deal.
It was thought the remains of Shiri, a mother of two, had been handed over along with those of her children.
But the Israeli military said forensic testing could only confirm the bodies of Ariel and Kfir, who would have been aged five and two, and not those of their mother.
Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had "put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin", with Ismail al-Thawabta, a spokesman for Hamas, suggesting Shiri's remains had been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after an Israeli air strike.
In a separate statement, the group said it affirmed its "seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations" under the ceasefire - and that it had "no interest in non-compliance".
It also said an investigation was under way, and called for the remains of the alleged Palestinian woman mistakenly handed over to Israel to be returned.
The Bibas family were among 251 people taken hostage during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, along with Shiri's husband, Yarden, who was released earlier this month.
Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Ariel and Kfir, the youngest of the Israeli hostages, were aged four and nine months when they were kidnapped. Their mother was 32.
Netanyahu has threatened that Hamas will pay the "full price" for failing to hand over Shiri's body, calling it a "cruel and evil violation" of their agreement.
No measures have yet been announced beyond Netanyahu saying Israel will act "with determination to bring Shiri home".
But a further claim from Israel that Ariel and Kfir had been "murdered by terrorists in cold blood" will further inflame feelings in Israel.
In November 2023, Hamas claimed the boys and Shiri had been killed in an IDF air strike. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.
On Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed forensic tests had revealed that Hamas killed Ariel and Kfir "with their bare hands".
"Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities," he said, without giving specifics about the alleged injuries. Hamas has not yet responded to these accusations.
For Israeli politicians inside and outside Netanyahu's government who have been demanding a resumption of the war in Gaza, these claims will be seen as more evidence that Hamas must be utterly eradicated.
The ceasefire is entering a new period of uncertainty, with the first phase drawing to an end - while negotiations on the next stage have yet to begin in earnest.
The second phase - in which all the remaining hostages, alive or dead, are due to be released - has been seen from the start as potentially more challenging than the first one.
Israel is demanding the complete disarmament of Hamas, while Hamas rejects the prospect of Israel continuing to maintain tight security control over Gaza.
Any major breakdown in the deal could see a return to fighting.
On the other side, though, is perhaps the majority of public opinion in Israel - that nothing should get in the way of all the remaining hostages being returned.
In expressing his condemnation of the latest developments, Israel's President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel must remember what he called its "highest duty - to do everything in our power to bring every one of our kidnapped sisters and brothers home".
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum echoed this, saying "every step" must be taken with "careful responsibility" to ensure the safe return of all hostages.
A fourth body was returned to Israel, from Gaza, on Thursday - that of 84-year-old peace activist Oded Lifschitz. Just like Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the Israeli military said Oded's remains had been confirmed by forensic testing.

Text: The sister-in-law of hostage Shiri Bibas said the family is "not seeking revenge right now" and called for her return from Gaza after Israel said Hamas had released the body of an unidentified woman.
Ofri Bibas Levy said in a statement that the family could not mourn Shiri's sons, whose bodies were handed over, until their mother is returned.
Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire after forensic testing revealed the body returned on Thursday was not Shiri.
A Hamas spokesman said her remains seem to have been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after an Israeli air strike. The group said it was investigating and affirmed its "full commitment to all our obligations" in the ceasefire.
The three other bodies given back to Israel on Thursday have been identified as Shiri's sons Ariel and Kfir, who would have been aged five and two, and peace activist Oded Lifschitz, 84, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
Hamas previously said the mother and her two children were killed in an Israeli air strike.
However, Israel said on Thursday intelligence and forensics show the boys "were brutally murdered by terrorists in captivity in November 2023".
Ms Bibas Levy, sister of Shiri's husband Yarden Bibas, who was released by Hamas on 1 February, said: "We are still waiting for Shiri and fear for her fate."
The events of recent days "emphasizes the urgent need to bring Shiri back to us, save the lives of the living hostages, and return all the fallen for burial", she said,
Her statement came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would "take revenge".
"For Ariel and Kfir's sake, and for Yarden's sake, we are not seeking revenge right now," Ms Bibas Levy said. "We are asking for Shiri."
Ms Bibas Levy said it was "Israel's responsibility and obligation" to bring her family members back alive after they were taken hostage during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.
"There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7, and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity," she said.
In a statement earlier on Friday, Netanyahu said: "Ariel, Kfir and Oded: I am so sorry we couldn't save you from the monsters who did this."
The "devastating news" that Shiri's body had not yet been returned has brought "profound grief" to the family, her sister-in-law said.
To her deceased nephews, Ms Bibas Levy said: "I'm sorry I cannot yet cry for you. We are waiting for Mommy Shiri."
Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the 7 October attacks.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attacks and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Text: Three empty buses have exploded on the southern edge of Tel Aviv in what Israeli police say is a "suspected terror attack".
It happened in an area where the buses were parked in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday night. There were no casualties.
Devices on two other buses failed to explode, police said. Local media reported that one of these carried a message referring to "revenge" for a recent Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the Israeli military to carry out "an intensive operation against centres of terrorism" in the West Bank in response.
Footage on social media showed at least one bus on fire, with a large plume of smoke rising above.
Speaking shortly after the explosions, police spokesperson Aryeh Doron urged the public to be on alert for "every suspected bag or object".
"We may be lucky if indeed the terrorists set these timers to the wrong hour. But it's too early to determine," he said on Israel's Channel 12 TV.
In a separate televised briefing, police commander Haim Sargarof said the devices used to set off the blasts were similar to those previously found in the West Bank, where Israel has been carrying out months of raids against militants, AFP news agency reported.
According to local media, one of the unexploded mechanisms, weighing 5kg (11lbs), carried a message saying "Revenge from Tulkarm", an apparent reference to a recent Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in northern West Bank.
Following the explosions, the Palestinian militant group Tulkarm Brigade released a statement that said "Revenge for the martyrs will not be forgotten as long as the occupier sits on our land", Israeli news site Haaretz reported. The statement did not claim responsibility for the attack.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been carrying out operations against Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank for months, especially focusing around Tulkarm and Jenin in the north.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids.

He was a man of peace, a campaigner for, and a friend of, Palestinians.
He was dragged from his home by Palestinian gunmen on 7 October and killed in captivity after being taken to Gaza alive.
The return of his body on Thursday was devastating news for Ms Lifschitz and her family, particularly her mother Yocheved who was also a hostage but returned alive and now will not be able to reunite with her husband of 63 years.
After identifying Oded's body, the head of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine said he had been killed in captivity more than a year ago. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said he "was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization."
The BBC were with Sharone, a filmmaker and academic, at her home when the ceasefire was announced last month.
She shed tears of joy and hope as at last she saw an opportunity where she would discover what had happened to her father. After more than a year of him being held hostage, she didn't know if he was alive or dead.
Sharone Lifschitz admitted then that at his age the hopes for his survival were slim, but she also believed "miracles can happen".
Ms Lifschitz has been an eloquent and dignified voice for the release of her father and the other hostages, and shed light on the trauma the hostage families have faced since their ordeal began.
"One way or another, we will know. We will know if he's still with us, if we can look after him. We will know who we are grieving for… My father didn't deserve this.
But she recognised there were "more graves to come."
And now, one will be for her father.
Oded Lifshitz was a journalist and veteran campaigner for peace who drove sick Palestinians to hospitals in Israel for treatment. In his campaign for Palestinian rights he met Yasser Arafat, then head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).
He helped to found Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived and was taken hostage from. It was a place where he was well-known for the cacti that he grew, the piano he played and the grandchildren he adored.
In a tribute, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was "deeply saddened" by Oded's death, and sent his "heartfelt condolences" to his family.
"When I met Sharone in Downing Street, she showed remarkable strength in the face of the most difficult circumstances," Sir Keir said.
"The news of her father's death is a tragedy. It is my hope that the peace he worked to see in the region through his charity work and activism will be achieved."
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the 7 October attacks and 251 others, including Oded and Yocheved, taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
As well as Oded, three other bodies were released by Hamas on Thursday - who Hamas said were Shiri Bibas, 33, and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir.
But on Thursday night, Israel's military accused Hamas of handing over the body of an unidentified person instead of that of Ms Bibas.
"During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage," the Israel Defense Forces said.
Oded's wife Yocheved, who was freed as a hostage by Hamas in 2023, met then-Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar while held in the tunnels under Gaza - and told him he should be ashamed of himself.
The British lawyers supporting the family said "Yocheved must be the only person to have met Sinwar, Netanyahu and the Pope, and given them all a piece of her mind. That is the kind of extraordinary person she is."
On Wednesday, as she received a peace award for her campaigning for the hostages, she said: "Oded was a great fighter for peace. He had very good relations with Palestinians and the thing that hurts the most is they betrayed him."
His family said they could now mourn for a husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather, but after "503 agonising days of uncertainty", they had "hoped and prayed for a different outcome".

Headline: Israel's 'hearts lie in tatters' as Hamas hands over first dead hostages

Text: "The hearts of an entire nation lie in tatters," Israel's President Isaac Herzog has said, as the bodies of four hostages taken alive by Hamas in its attack on 7 October 2023 were returned to Tel Aviv.
Hamas says the bodies are those of a mother and two children from the Bibas family, whose unknown fate has gripped Israel. Israel has confirmed only the identity of the fourth - Oded Lifschitz, 84, a veteran peace activist - after a forensic examination.
President Herzog wrote "there are no words" in a post on social media platform X, asking the four for forgiveness "for not bringing you home safely".
It is the first time Hamas has returned captives dead since the ceasefire began last month.
Following Hamas's handover of the four bodies, thousands of Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and observed a minute's silence.
Six living hostages are due to be freed on Saturday.
The news that Shiri Bibas, 33, and her sons, who would now be aged five and two, were dead triggered an outpouring of grief across the country.
Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. The Israeli government never confirmed the claim.
Addressing Israelis in a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was "united in unbearable grief. Every home in Israel bows its head today.
"We all rage over the monsters of Hamas," he said.
A lawyer for Dr Sharone Lifschitz, the British-based daughter of Oded Lifschitz, said the day was "one of immense sadness, and of failure".
Early on Thursday morning, in choreographed scenes reminiscent of recent handovers of living hostages, four black coffins were laid out on a stage decked with propaganda in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in front of crowds of spectators.
One of the backdrops depicted a ghoulish image of Benjamin Netanyahu with fangs looming over a picture of the four hostages when they were alive. Another read: "The Return of the War = The Return of your Prisoners in Coffins".
One of those present, Ikram Abu Salout, told the BBC she was against handing over the bodies. "They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are."
A Red Cross official appeared to sign documents at a table alongside armed Hamas fighters before the four coffins transferred to vehicles belonging to the humanitarian organisation.
United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said the handover was "abhorrent and cruel, and flies in the face of international law".
"We urge that all returns are conducted in privacy, and with respect and care," he added.
The International Committee of the Red Cross echoed his words, saying: "These operations should be done privately out of the utmost respect for the deceased and for those left grieving."
After the handover, the bodies were transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza and brought to Israel. People - many with Israeli flags and yellow ones representing the hostages - lined the streets as a police convoy with the coffins passed by. The bodies have been taken to the Abu Kabir forensic institute in Jaffa, Israel, for post-mortems.
The Bibas family, and Oded Lifschtiz and his wife, were among residents taken from kibbutz Nir Oz when hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border with Israel and attacked communities, security forces sites and a music festival.
About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attack and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Yarden Bibas, 35, was released on 1 February along with two other hostages as part of an exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Oded Lifschitz, a retired journalist, had been held by the armed Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. His wife Yocheved was freed by Hamas on 23 October 2023.
The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January. Israel has confirmed there will be eight.
The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire.
Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.
Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged.
Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.

Headline: BBC faces questions over Gaza film's Hamas link

Text: The culture secretary has said she will raise concerns with BBC bosses about a documentary on Gaza that was narrated by the son of a Hamas official.
The broadcaster has been criticised for Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which centred on a 13-year-old boy who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture.
Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, Israel and others.
The BBC said it had not been informed of the family connection in advance by the film's production company and has apologised "for the omission of that detail".
The broadcaster has added a message to the start of the programme on its iPlayer streaming service, making clear the family link, and saying the production team had "full editorial control".
Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she would discuss the matter with the BBC's director general and chairman, "particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme".
A number of prominent TV figures including actress Tracy-Ann Oberman, Strike producer Neil Blair, former BBC One controller Danny Cohen and producer Leo Pearlman have written to the BBC to call for an investigation.
They said: "Given the serious nature of these concerns, the BBC should immediately postpone any broadcast repeats of the programme, remove it from iPlayer and take down any social media clips of the programme until an independent investigation is carried out and its findings published with full transparency for licence-fee payers."
They raised concerns about the "editorial standards of this programme and the BBC's compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, its own Editorial Guidelines and English law", and asked the corporation to explain what had happened.
"If the BBC was aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri was the son of a terrorist leader, why was this not disclosed to audiences during the programme?" they asked.
"If the BBC was not aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri is the son of a terrorist leader, what diligence checks were undertaken and why did they fail?"
The BBC has kept the programme on iPlayer and the new message at the start reads: "The narrator of this film is 13 year old Abdullah. His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza.
"The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah."
In a statement, the BBC said: "Since the transmission of our documentary on Gaza, the BBC has become aware of the family connections of the film's narrator, a child called Abdullah.
"We've promised our audiences the highest standards of transparency, so it is only right that as a result of this new information, we add some more detail to the film before its retransmission. We apologise for the omission of that detail from the original film."
It added: "We followed all of our usual compliance procedures in the making of this film, but we had not been informed of this information by the independent producers when we complied and then broadcast the finished film.
"The film remains a powerful child's eye view of the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza which we believe is an invaluable testament to their experiences, and we must meet our commitment to transparency."
Nandy said the matter was "a conversation I'll definitely be having with the BBC".
Speaking to LBC on Thursday, she said: "I watched it last night. It's something that I will be discussing with them, particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme.
"These things are difficult, and I do want to acknowledge that for the BBC, they take more care than most broadcasters in terms of the way that they try to portray these things. They've been attacked for being too pro-Gaza, they've been attacked for being anti-Gaza. But it is absolutely essential that we get this right."
The documentary, which aired on BBC Two on Monday, was made by Hoyo Films, which has not commented.

Headline: Return of bodies marks day of anguish for Israel

Text: On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.
The return of the dead.
It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.
Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.
But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.
As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.
Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.
The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.
After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.
A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.
Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.
In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.
All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.
Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.
The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.
"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.
"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."
Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.
Oded was 84 years old at the time. He and his wife, Yocheved, were both taken to Khan Younis in Gaza, where they were separated, never to see each other again.
Yocheved was released by Hamas two weeks after the attack.
"We need to close this wound and move forward," Yizhar said, adding that his father, a noted journalist and peace activist, had long had a vision about how to resolve the conflicts of the Middle East.
"It's sad that we went through this whole cycle and didn't solve it," Yizhar said. "We left it as something simmering, and look where we are now."
Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.
In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. It says some have been held for decades.
"I don't like this agreement at all," Ikram Abu Salout said in Khan Younis. "They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are."
As she was speaking, bulldozers flying Egyptian flags were finally arriving in northern Gaza. Israel allowed the equipment to enter, in exchange for Thursday's handover and the release of six more living hostages this coming Saturday.

Headline: 'I cried for days': Office raids and arrests shock aid workers in Yemen

Text: When Hanaa arrived at work a few months ago, she found "drawers and doors smashed, and the boss surrounded by security personnel".
Computers, phones, cameras and documents were all confiscated, her boss was arrested and the organisation's bank account was eventually frozen.
Hanaa works for a US-funded non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Yemen, that supports women's empowerment and trains people to solve problems through negotiation.
But the country's civil war, which has lasted more than a decade and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, has made life for NGO workers increasingly dangerous.
Twenty-four UN employees, along with workers from other local and international NGOs have been detained by Houthi rebels in the past few months.
A wave of arrests in January has intensified the climate of fear - one person from the World Food Programme who was detained died in custody.
The situation has left humanitarian workers feeling their freedom of movement has been greatly restricted. As a result, many organisations, including the UN, are scaling back operations, threatening to make life for people already devastated by war even worse.
Ten years ago, Iranian-backed Houthi militants seized control of much of the west of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the internationally-recognised government. Saudi Arabia, has since carried out intensive air raids on its neighbour - with logistical and intelligence support from the US and UK - to try to prevent the Houthi rebels from taking control of the whole country.
It was Houthi officials who raided Hanaa's office and detained her boss, and she fears retribution if she speaks out. So, for their safety, we have changed the names of Hanaa and others in Yemen who we interviewed for this article.
By cracking down on humanitarian workers, Hanaa believes the Houthis aim to spread fear among the public. But what hurts her deeply is how the public reacted.
"When I checked social media, it was appalling to find out that people see us as spies," she says.
A day after her boss was detained, Hanaa was glued to her TV, watching a pro-Houthi channel airing what it described as confessions of espionage, made by nine local people who had once worked at the long-closed US embassy in Sanaa. They were arrested in 2021.
That was the moment she feared things would get worse for her, as she worked for a US-funded NGO. She decided to leave her home in northern Yemen.
By the time she reached the south, she felt traumatised. "For three days I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stop crying," she says.
Now she's worried that US President Donald Trump's decision to re-designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation could lead them to target everyone who works in US-funded projects.
Once someone is arrested, it can be hard for them to get any support, according to Yemeni lawyer Abdulaziz, who represents 14 detainees. They have been behind bars for several months - three are UN staff, while the others are employed by local NGOs. "During the first three months of detention, my clients didn't communicate with anyone," he says.
Abdulaziz is getting increasingly worried that their whereabouts is still unknown. More recently, he says that his clients were able to make a few brief phone calls to their families. "Each call was between five to 10 minutes," he explains.
The BBC approached the Houthis to ask about their treatment of aid workers, but got no reply.
In addition to the detentions, lifesaving assistance from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been paused as a result of President Trump's freeze on the organisation's operations around the world, amid allegations of waste and misuse of funds.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) warns that that the impact of President Trump's policies and the Houthis' arbitrary arrests is "nothing short of devastating". It "will have massive and dramatic impact on aid provision in Yemen", says Niku Jafarnia, a Yemen and Bahrain researcher at the organisation.
According to HRW, the US was funding about one third of humanitarian aid in Yemen, much of it through USAID. Between 2015 and 2021, it provided more than $3.6 billion, making it the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance in the country, according to the UN.
"Cutting aid would be a death sentence to us," warns Amal, a mother of nine. She lives in a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen, alongside thousands of other families.
Even over the phone, it is clear what a heavy burden this woman is carrying. Her slow speech is laden with emotion. It is nearly 10 years since she lost her home.
Amal singlehandedly supports her huge family. Her husband has acute asthma, so he can't work. The family had to flee their hometown further north after the conflict began.
Since then, life has been increasingly unkind to them. The camp, on barren desert land, hardly resembles a home. Their only shelter is a worn-out plastic tent, with no chairs or beds. It is hard for her children to find joy in a place which lacks almost everything.
"If this supply line provided by NGOs is cut, my children might die. We have no jobs, no income, nothing," Amal adds.
About half of the population are in bad need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 10 million children, according to the UN children's charity Unicef. The UN Human Development Index lists Yemen as one of the 10 least developed countries in the world.
Amal tells us she receives a monthly food basket from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), but it barely lasts two weeks. When they run out of food, she says her only option is to leave the camp and go out begging in the city's streets. She passes restaurants and shops, hoping for a few loaves of bread or a packet of rice.
"I am covered in shame, but should I leave my children to starve? I am totally helpless," Amal explains. Helplessness often takes its toll on her. "I cry a lot when I realise that I don't have a penny," she says, her voice both anguished and bitter.
A large number of children suffer from diarrhoea and pneumonia due to the poor hygiene, malnutrition and miserable living conditions, but adequate medication is rarely available.
At a clinic in northern Yemen, the shelves where medicines should be lie empty. Staff told us the medical stock they have is nothing compared to the people's needs.
The BBC contacted the UN seeking comment on the current aid distribution process and recent arrests but received no reply.
However, addressing the UN Security Council, Hans Grundberg, the UN Special envoy for Yemen, condemned the detention of its staff as "not only a violation of fundamental human rights, but also a direct threat to the UN's ability to distribute aid to the most needy". He also called for the immediate release of all detainees, whether from the UN or from other local and international NGOs.
It is for families like Amal's that Hanaa and her co-workers try to make life better.
She proudly remembers how they sent girls to school in one of the conservative northern areas. When parents complained about neighbours being able to see their daughters during break time, "we held discussions between residents, and eventually agreed to cover the playground, so that girls could go back to class", she explains.
She fears that the absence of this support, due to fear and lack of funds, could increase rates of illiteracy. "We are the only ones who have survived during the collapse of the state, in order to serve the people," Hanaa says with a sigh.
The names of Hanaa, Abdulaziz and Amal were changed for this article.

Headline: Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family

Text: Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group.
The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack.
Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamas earlier this month.
Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned.
In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt.
In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed "handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family".
Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives.
An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named.
In a statement, the Bibas family said: "In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase.
"We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter.
"Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.
Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday.
They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time.
The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day.
They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri.
Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.
Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.
Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel.
But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war.
Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin "this week".
He said Israel would "not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive.
"If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer," Saar said.
A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals.
Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people.
Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave.

Headline: Israeli troops stay inside south Lebanon after withdrawal deadline

Text: Israeli forces have pulled out from towns and villages in southern Lebanon but remain in five locations along the border in what the Lebanese government describes as a violation of a ceasefire deal.
Tuesday marked the end of the deadline for the Israeli withdrawal from the country, which was part of a truce that came into force in November and put an end to 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant and political movement Hezbollah.
The agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, also stipulated the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from southern Lebanon and the deployment of Lebanese soldiers to the area where the group has been the dominant force for decades.
But a day earlier, the Israeli military announced its forces would remain at five "strategic" hilltops, until the Lebanese army fully implemented its part of the deal.
It was not clear how long they would stay.
In response to the announcement, Lebanon said Israel must withdraw completely. It said it would consider "the continued Israeli presence in any inch of Lebanese territory an occupation".
The truce agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, put an end to 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant and political movement Hezbollah.
Early on Tuesday, Lebanese soldiers moved into the areas vacated by Israeli troops and began clearing roadblocks and checking for unexploded ordnance.
Returning in convoys, residents carried the yellow Hezbollah flag and posters with the face of the group's late leader Hassan Nasrallah.
In Kfar Kila, right next to the border with Israel, no building had not been destroyed or heavily damaged. Families searched the rubble for personal items, but few could have been saved.
"Our house is destroyed just like all the other houses," said 25-year-old Safaa Jouma, whose brother was a fighter killed in the war.
"We couldn't save anything. The house was levelled."
The ceasefire requires Israel to withdraw and for Lebanon's army to replace all armed groups south of the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) north of Israel
Israel's withdrawal had been postponed from the original 60-day deadline - which fell on 26 January - stipulated in the ceasefire.
The positions where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops have been deployed are in mountainous terrain on the edge of the internationally recognised border between Lebanon and Israel.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the IDF was "temporarily remaining in five strategic high points", describing it as "necessary for our security".
"The IDF's enforcement activities against Hezbollah will continue at full strength. We will not allow a return to the reality of 7 October [2023]," Saar said, referring to the date when Palestinian Hamas gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza.
Hezbollah had launched its military campaign against Israel the following day, saying it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.
The group was heavily damaged in the conflict, the deadliest fought with Israel since the militant group was formed in 1982.
Lebanese authorities say more than 3,960 people - many of them civilians - were killed during the hostilities, and one million others were displaced from areas where Hezbollah had a strong presence.
Israeli authorities say more than 80 Israeli soldiers and 47 civilians were killed. About 60,000 citizens were displaced from northern Israel.
Most of those displaced in Lebanon have returned home, the UN says, while only a minority of those displaced in Israel have done so, according to reports.

Text: Detained Britons Craig and Lindsay Foreman have been charged in Iran with espionage, the country's judiciary news agency has said.
Mr and Mrs Foreman were arrested in the city of Kerman in January but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, emerged last week.
Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said that the couple, both aged 52, had "entered Iran under the guise of tourists" and "gathered information in multiple provinces of the country".
The couple had been on a motorbike trip around the world and had planned to stay in Iran for five days before they were charged with espionage, or spying, by Iranian authorities.
Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe and had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December and were planning to be in Pakistan by 4 January.
In a series of social media posts before they were detained, the couple - who moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Spain in 2019 - described their joy at being in Iran.
Lindsay Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was "having an amazing time".
Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the "lovely people" of a "lovely country".
Announcing the charges, Mr Jahangir said that the couple had been under surveillance by provincial intelligence agencies and were "subsequently arrested as part of a coordinated intelligence operation".
He added: "These individuals were co-operating with front organisations linked to the intelligence services of hostile and Western countries under the pretence of research and investigative activities."
The chief justice of Kerman province, Hojatoleslam wal-Muslimeen Hamidi, said: "According to intelligence and security agency monitoring, the connection of these individuals with several institutions affiliated with intelligence services has been confirmed, and further investigations are ongoing."
Alison Smith, a former neighbour of the couple, described them as "just normal family people".
Ms Smith told the BBC she was a "bit surprised" by the couple's decision to travel to Iran, but said they probably "thought they were going to be going on an adventure".
They had been on "loads of adventures" in the past, Ms Smith said.
"They went all over the place," she said, describing the pair as "very sporty, very adventurous".
The couple had appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia.
A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said "we are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran", adding officials are continuing to raise the case "directly" with Iranian authorities.
The Foreign Office is providing the detainees with consular assistance and supporting their family members, the spokesperson said.
The Foreign Office's official advice is against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at "significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention".
Having a British passport or connections to the UK "can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you", it adds.
In recent years, Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK.
Human rights groups say they are often held as leverage, released only when Iran receives something in return.
Richard Ratcliffe, whose wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran for six years, said Foreign Office travel advice would be "clearer" if it reflected the "risks of hostage-taking" in the country.

Headline: A glimpse at Picasso and Pollock masterpieces kept in Tehran vault

Text: It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it.
For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery.
According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn.
Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.
The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.
The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.
The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.
From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.
Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history.
Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed.
On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition.
The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution.
Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum.
It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene.
The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.
But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.
Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.
Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.
After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.
It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.
Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran.
Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world.
Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it "one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West".
The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.
Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.
And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.
But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.
Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.
Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.
Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran.

Headline: Couple held in Iran need 'prompt' UK action, says Nazanin's husband
Author: David Mercer, BBC News

Text: The UK government must act "more promptly" to help a British couple currently being held in Iran than it did to secure the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, her husband Richard Ratcliffe has said.
Craig and Lindsay Foreman were arrested in January, but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, only emerged earlier this week.
The couple, both aged 52, had been on a motorbike trip across the world and had only planned to be in Iran for five days.
Mr Ratcliffe, whose wife was arrested in Iran in 2016 and not released until six years later, said the dangers of travelling to the country would be "a lot clearer" if Foreign Office travel advice reflected "the risks of hostage-taking" there.
The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at "significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention".
Having a British passport or connections to the UK "can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you", it adds.
The Foreman family said the couple's detention was a "distressing situation" and they are "deeply focused on ensuring their safety and wellbeing during this trying time".
Responding to the case, Mr Ratcliffe told the PA news agency: "My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are not in for a long ordeal, and that the government is able to respond more promptly than it did in our case.
"I do think the risks would be a lot clearer to people if the UK travel advice to Iran talked about the risks of hostage-taking. People would be more alert to the fact that it is not personal, and it doesn't matter whether you have travelled there with a good heart."
Posting on Instagram before being detained, Mrs Foreman acknowledged travelling to Iran, against Foreign Office advice, and to Pakistan was risky and "slightly scary".
But she wrote "we know the rewards of meeting incredible people, hearing their stories, and seeing the breathtaking landscapes of these regions could far outweigh the fear".
Mr Ratcliffe said the "top priority" for the UK government should be ensuring Mr and Mrs Foreman were not being held in solitary confinement, because it was "important they do not feel alone".
He added a court process in the case may happen soon but said: "It's not a real court... it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government's attention. And it will hurt much the same. I really hope they will be okay."
The UK Foreign Office did not respond directly to Mr Ratcliffe's comments when approached by BBC News, but said it was providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran and is in contact with the local authorities.
Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian national, was arrested at an airport in Tehran in April 2016 and accused of spying charges, which she denied.
Mr Ratcliffe went on hunger strike twice as part of his campaign for his wife's release.
She was ultimately freed and returned to Britain in March 2022 after the UK government agreed to settle a £400m debt dating back to the 1970s.
Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe and had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December. They planned to be in Pakistan by 4 January.
After staying in the cities of Tabriz, Tehran and Isfahan, accompanied by a tour guide, they travelled on to Kerman, in east-central Iran, but never checked into their hotel there.
The Iranian authorities have not said what the couple are accused of.
In a series of social media posts before they were detained, the pair described their joy at being in Iran.
Mrs Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was "having an amazing time". Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the "lovely people" of a "lovely country".
The couple had moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Andalucia, Spain, in 2019 and appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats.
Mrs Foreman is reported to have been carrying out a research project on their journey to Australia, asking people what it means to be human and what constitutes a good life.
She was due to present her findings at a conference on positive psychology in Brisbane in July.

Headline: Iran's abandoned bases in Syria: Years of military expansion lie in ruins
Author: Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent, BBC World Service, Reporting fromSyria
Published Date: 2025-02-16T00:15:40.299Z
Text: Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria.
The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks.
Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war.
Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its "security belt" against Israel.
We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups.
From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base.
A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi - named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024.
The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria.
The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation.
"Iranians were here. They all fled," one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. "Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods."
Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated.
The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf.
They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria.
Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian "military advisers" and their Iranian commanders.
Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was "to fight against jihadi groups" and to protect "Shia holy shrines" against radical Sunni militants.
It created paramilitary groups of mainly Afghan, Pakistani and Iraqi fighters.
Yet, when the final moment came, Iran was unprepared. Orders for retreat reached some bases at the very last moment. "Developments happened so fast," a senior member of an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group tells me. "The order was to just take your backpack and leave."
Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians.
An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus.
He says they thought their operation would take "about a year" and best, they'd "capture Aleppo in three to six months". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days.
The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.
That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally – the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike.
This "situation of psychological collapse" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat.
But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says.
"There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel."
As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters.
On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: "Down with Israel" and "Down with the USA".
It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as "highly sensitive".
Abdullah, 65, and his family are among the very few locals who stayed and lived here alongside the IRGC-led groups. He says this life was hard.
His house is only a few metres away from the headquarters and in between, there are deep trenches with barbed wire.
"Movement at night was prohibited," he says.
His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. "They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects," he recalls.
Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. "They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them."
Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the "Iranian militias" have left, but still remembers the "stressful" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then "they just vanished in a few hours".
"This was an occupation. Iranian occupation," says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base.
I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians.
I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was.
"Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it," he explained.
This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran.
The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians.
Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed.
The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory.
While supreme leader Ali Khamenei called on "Syrian youths" to "resist" those who "have brought instability" to Syria, Iran's foreign ministry has taken a more balanced view.
It says the country "backs any government supported by the Syrian people".
In one of his first interviews, Syria's new leader Sharaa described their victory over Assad as an "end of the Iranian project". But he hasn't ruled out having a "balanced" relationship with Tehran.
For the moment, though, Iran is not welcome in Syria. After years of expanding its military presence, everything Tehran built is now in ruins, both on the battlefield and, it seems, in the eyes of a large part of Syria's public.
Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh.
But left behind now is evidence of a brief fight - a few bullet shells and a military uniform covered with blood.

Headline: Israeli hostages and Palestinian inmates freed in latest ceasefire swap

Text: Hamas has released another three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners following a week in which the fragile ceasefire deal appeared under threat.
American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29, were freed in return for 369 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
So far 19 hostages and more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been freed in the first phase of ceasefire deal which began on 19 January.
The swap came days after Hamas said it would pause the release of hostages, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the deal - an allegation denied by Israel.
Israel, backed by US President Donald Trump, said "intense" fighting would resume unless the hostages were handed over. Hamas later said it remained committed to the ceasefire, and that Israel was "responsible for any complications or delays".
But on Saturday the sixth swap went ahead, with the hostages handed over to Red Cross workers in a highly-choreographed public show in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
Surrounded by heavily armed Hamas militants, the men briefly addressed a crowd of Palestinians before being transferred into Red Cross vehicles.
They did not look as gaunt as the hostages freed a week earlier - their appearance had aroused anger in Israel and elsewhere.
Under the first six-week stage of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are supposed to be freed.
The three men were airlifted by military helicopters to a hospital in central Israel, where they underwent medical tests and were reunited with relatives.
Yair Horn and his brother Eitan, 37, had been abducted from a kibbutz during the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas. Eitan remains in captivity in Gaza.
Pictures showed Yair Horn hugging his mother and his brother Amos in hospital, and a message where he wrote "Eitan, you're next".
US citizen Sagui Dekel-Chen also reunited with his wife, where he learned that he had one-year-old daughter. His wife had been eight months pregnant with their third child when he was captured by Hamas in October 2023.
US President Donald Trump marked the hostage release on Saturday, noting Hamas had not followed through with their threat.
"They seem to be in good shape," he said.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog, posting on social media, said the hostages had been "forced to endure" a "despicable and cynical ceremony".
In a social media post, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to work with the US to "ensure that all hostages return to Israel soon".
The majority of the freed Palestinians were taken to Gaza, although some were taken to the West Bank. In both areas, crowds gathered to welcome the former prisoners.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society told the BBC that five of those released in the West Bank city of Ramallah were taken straight to hospital.
"They all have chronic illnesses," said Mohammad Faqih, an official from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, adding that one man had a broken leg.
Most of the 36 Palestinians serving life sentences will reportedly be deported to Egypt.
The latest releases mean that under the ceasefire, Hamas is due to free another 14 hostages.
However Israel says eight are of them are dead, meaning six living Israelis are still expected to be returned in the first phase.
A total of 141 hostages have now been freed, including 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals released as part of a previous deal between Israel and Hamas.
About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.
This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

Text: The family of a British couple in custody in Iran say they are united in their determination to secure their safe return.
Craig and Lindsay Foreman were arrested in January, but news of their detention emerged on Thursday when state-run Iranian media reported they were being held on unspecified security charges.
The couple, both aged 52, had been on a motorbike trip across the world, and had planned to be in Iran for only five days.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office on their family's behalf said: "This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and wellbeing during this trying time."
The family called it a "distressing situation", adding: "We are actively engaging with the British government and relevant authorities, working diligently to navigate the complexities of this matter."
They said the "emotional burden of this situation weighs heavily on us", and "the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community" had "provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal".
Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe.
They had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December and had planned to be in Pakistan by 4 January.
After staying in the cities of Tabriz, Tehran and Isfahan, accompanied by a tour guide, they travelled on to Kerman, in east-central Iran, but never checked into their hotel there.

Lindsay Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was "having an amazing time".
Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the "lovely people" of a "lovely country".
Mrs Foreman posted a picture of herself on 3 January meeting a cleric in the town of Isfahan. Writing on Instagram, she said: "Travel continues to teach me that humanity's core is shared: kindness, humility, and respect for one another."
On Facebook that day she wrote: "Despite differences in culture, language, and traditions, we've seen something beautifully universal: kindness, humour, hospitality - and a shared love of good food!"
The Iranian authorities have not said what the couple are accused of.
The pair moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Andalucia, Spain, in 2019 and had appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats.

She added: "From the vast deserts of Iran to the towering peaks of Pakistan, we hope to share the beauty, hospitality, and humanity that often go unnoticed."
The Foreign Office says it is in contact with the local authorities in Iran, and is providing the couple with consular assistance.
A photograph of the couple, with their faces blurred, meeting the British ambassador Hugo Shorter at the public prosecutor's office in Kerman was published on Wednesday.
The Foreign Office currently advises British nationals to avoid all travel to Iran.
"British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention," advice says. "Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you."
Over the past few years, dozens of foreign and dual nationals have been arrested in Iran on vague security-related charges.
Human rights groups say they are often used by the Iranian authorities for political leverage.

Headline: Senior UN peacekeeper injured in convoy attack in Lebanon

Text: The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon says its outgoing deputy commander has been injured after one of its convoys was "violently attacked".
The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said in a statement that the convoy was taking peacekeepers to Beirut airport when it was targeted and one of its vehicles set on fire.
Protesters have been blocking the road to the airport following a decision by the Lebanese government to bar two Iranian planes from landing.
Both Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun and the country's army condemned the attack on Unifil, and said they would work to arrest those involved.
Several videos shared online show one white UN vehicle alight, as a group of young men, carrying yellow flags, chase and beat what appear to be peacekeepers as they attempt to flee.
Separate footage shows a group of men shouting as they kick, hit and climb onto a convoy of three UN vehicles along a dark road.
Unifil's injured deputy commander, who was not named, was returning home after ending his mission, according to a statement from the United Nations.
"We are shocked by this outrageous attack on peacekeepers who have been serving to restore security and stability to south Lebanon during a difficult time," it added.
"Attacks on peacekeepers are flagrant violations of international law and may amount to war crimes. We demand a full and immediate investigation by Lebanese authorities and for all perpetrators to be brought to justice."
Aoun said the attack was "unacceptable" and "cannot be allowed to be repeated".
In a social media post from the presidency, he added: "The security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to destabilize and undermine civil peace in the country."
Supporters of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah have gathered outside Beirut's airport since Thursday over a stand-off between Lebanon and Iran that saw two Iranian planes barred from landing in the Lebanese capital.
It has left dozens of Lebanese nationals stranded in Iran.
The measure was put in place after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that Iran's Quds Force had been "exploiting" international flights to "smuggle" funds to arm Hezbollah.
The IDF's Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said it was in contact with the committee monitoring the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, but alleged: "Despite the efforts made, we estimate that some of these money smuggling attempts have succeeded."
The Amal movement, a group allied to Hezbollah, said "the attack on Unifil is an attack on southern Lebanon", and described it as "a stab at civil peace".
Lebanese Interior Minister Ahmed Al-Hajjar told state media he would convene a security meeting on Saturday in light of the attack, calling it a "crime against peacekeeping forces".
Unifil was created as a peace monitoring force in southern Lebanon in 1978. Its presence there was stepped up following Israel's war with Hezbollah in 2006.

Text: Hamas has released the names of three hostages due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, after days of fears over the future of the ceasefire.
They are Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, Argentine-Israeli Yair Horn, and US-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen.
Israel has said it will resume bombing if the three are not released on time. The warning came after Hamas said it was postponing the releases in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire.
President Trump said the ceasefire should be scrapped if Hamas did not release all the hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday.
Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 766 prisoners.
During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages should be freed in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel.
The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.
More than 48,230 people have been killed by the Israel offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
There are 73 hostages taken on 7 October who are still being held in Gaza. There are also three other Israeli hostages - one of whom is dead - who have been held in Gaza for a decade or more.
Alexander Troufanov, 29, Yair Horn, 46, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, were all seized from Kibbutz Nir Oz on the edge of Gaza.
The ceasefire has been under strain since it began, with each side taking reciprocal action over alleged violations. Intense efforts by mediators US, Egypt and Qatar have managed to stop it from collapsing.
Israel has been especially infuriated by the staged way hostages have been released - publicly displayed on platforms alongside gunmen and in front of crowds of spectators, before being handed over to the Red Cross in chaotic scenes.
For its part, Hamas has accused Israel of preventing what the group says are the amount of tents and aid lorries required to be let into Gaza under the terms of the ceasefire. Israel denies this.
Meanwhile the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published video of what it said was a rocket fired at Israel from Gaza on Thursday. It said the rocket failed and landed inside Gaza. A source in the Hamas-run police said the rocket was an unexploded Israeli ordinance that had fired into the air while it was being moved away, Reuters news agency reported.
West Bank-based Palestinian news agency Wafa said a 14-year-old boy, Hammoudeh Alaa Saud, was killed the same day by what it said was Israeli ordnance which blew up in Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp.

Headline: Gaza plans put Egypt-US relations to tough test
Author: Yolande Knell in Jerusalem and Wael Hussein in Cairo, BBC News

Text: In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.
In the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire. Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.
But now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to "a parcel of land" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.
Egyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.
"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!" says Abdo, a civil engineer. "The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them. This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence."
Others stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.
To try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz. He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.
Egypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.
Since Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally. Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty. Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.
However, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism. American military aid "does not constitute any value to Egypt," Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said. He insisted Egyptians refuse "pressure" or "blackmail".
Egypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.
Egyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.
Egypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.
The hope now is that by devising its own "masterplan" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.
The Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (£16bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.
The plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: "I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt."
Various "innovative ideas" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.
Speaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states "don't like" the Trump Gaza plan. "Now, if someone has a better plan – and we hope they do," he went on, "now's the time to present it."
Some Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative "comprehensive vision" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.
Proposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.
Egypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.
However, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.
The former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge. But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.
Egypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to "achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause."
Back outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.
Already Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.
Ultimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.
"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.
"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA.
"I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences."

Headline: What is Hezbollah and why has it been fighting Israel in Lebanon?
Author: No author available
Published Date: 2025-02-14T15:27:30.000Z
Text: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon which has been involved in a series of violent conflicts with Israel.
It has strong backing from Iran and opposes Israel's right to exist. The group is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel and many other nations, including the UK and US.
The latest Hezbollah-Israel conflict erupted in October 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets over the frontier after the start of the Gaza war, in solidarity with its ally Hamas. Israel responded with strikes.
The conflict escalated further in September 2024, when Israel said it wanted tens of thousands of people forced from their homes by Hezbollah rocket attacks to be able to safely return. It began a campaign of wide-ranging air strikes against Hezbollah, followed by a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.
The conflict has left Hezbollah severely weakened.
The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon, including many civilians. More than a million people have been displaced in Lebanon since 8 October 2023.
Israel says 45 Israeli civilians and 75 soldiers were killed in the conflict to November 2024.
A ceasefire agreement announced on 27 November requires both Hezbollah and Israeli forces to leave southern Lebanon. The initial deadline of 26 January was extended until 18 February.
Hezbollah emerged out of Shia militias formed to resist Israel after its invasion of southern Lebanon in 1982, during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
Its name means "Party of God" in Arabic.
Officially announcing its existence in 1985, Hezbollah called for an Islamic government in Lebanon. It declared that its confrontation with Israel "should only end when it has been removed from existence".
The group's attacks on Israeli forces are widely considered in Lebanon to have been instrumental in Israel's decision to end its 18-year-long occupation in 2000. The date Israeli forces left is a public holiday in Lebanon, called Resistance and Liberation Day.
Afterwards, Hezbollah resisted pressure to disarm and maintained a significant military presence in the south of Lebanon.
The group, and the Lebanese government, refused to accept the UN's finding that the Israeli withdrawal was complete, saying disputed border areas were still occupied. Sporadic exchanges of fire with Israeli forces continued.
In July 2006, Hezbollah fighters launched a deadly cross-border attack, triggering a massive Israeli response. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day war, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians.
The next month, the UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1701, which ended the war and created a buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon. The current ceasefire deal also uses this agreement as its basis.
It demanded that non-state armed groups in Lebanon disarm and pull back about 30km (19 miles) north of the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel, in line with the Litani River.
It said this area "should be free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the Lebanese authorities and UN peacekeepers".
However, Hezbollah, which had declared victory, did not comply and went on to build extensive infrastructure in the area.
Lebanon says Israel's violations of the resolution have included military flights over its territory.
Hezbollah also continued to upgrade and expand its arsenal. With Iranian funding, training and weapons, its forces became stronger than those of the Lebanese army.
In 2009, the group issued a new political manifesto in which it dropped the reference to an Islamic government but rejected "any compromise with Israel or recognising its legitimacy".
Its fighters also became battle-hardened in neighbouring Syria's civil war. By 2013, they were helping then-President Bashar al-Assad's government turn the tide against rebel and jihadist forces.
Hezbollah has also been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets outside Lebanon.
Many of Hezbollah's most senior military and political leaders were killed during the latest conflict with Israel.
Hezbollah was led by Hassan Nasrallah, a Shia cleric, from 1992 until his death in an Israeli air strike in September 2024. Nasrallah had played a key role in turning Hezbollah into a political force, as well as a military one.
He was revered by Hezbollah supporters and had close links with Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Despite being one of the best known and most influential figures in the Middle East, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for many years, to avoid being targeted by Israel.
Following his death, Hezbollah announced in late October that its deputy secretary general Naim Qassem would become its new leader.
Other senior figures killed in Israeli attacks include cleric Hashem Safieddine, who had been expected to replace Nasrallah.
Hezbollah's current military strength is difficult to assess as it has suffered heavy losses.
Before the ceasefire was announced in November, much of its infrastructure was destroyed, its weapons arsenal was depleted and hundreds of fighters killed.
The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in Syria is also seen as a significant blow to Hezbollah. Syria, under Assad, played an important role in Hezbollah's connections to Iran and it was a key staging post for the transfer of weapons and ammunition to the group.
Previously, Hezbollah had been considered one of the most heavily armed, non-state military forces in the world.
In 2021, the group claimed to have 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates put the number between 20,000 and 50,000.
Before the conflict with Israel escalated, it was estimated to have 120,000-200,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
Most of this arsenal was made up of small, unguided, surface-to-surface artillery rockets. It was also thought to have anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel.
The war with Israel has also led to a political shift in Lebanon.
A new president, Joseph Aoun, was appointed in January 2025, after the country spent more than two years without one.
Aoun was the head of Lebanon's army and he was selected despite Hezbollah preferring another candidate. He has pledged to work to ensure that the Lebanese state has "the exclusive right to bear arms" - a direct reference to Hezbollah.
In addition, a post-war cabinet named by the new prime minister, Nawaf Salam, excludes Hezbollah. However, it is split evenly among Lebanon's religious groups and Hezbollah's ally, Amal, was allowed to choose four ministers.
New US Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus has warned that the Trump administration has "clear red lines" that Hezbollah will not be tolerated as a part of the government.
Before the war, Hezbollah - along with other political groups - was already constrained by Lebanon's many problems, including one of the world's worst economic crises and political corruption. No group ran the country and there had been no functioning government since elections in 2022.
However, although the country was deeply divided over Hezbollah, it had considerable influence, with a seat in every previous cabinet formed since 2005 and a network of social services including schools and healthcare facilities.
It also enjoyed substantial popular support from those who saw it as a resistance force against Israel.
In a country where religious identity strongly impacts people's politics, many of Hezbollah's supporters have traditionally been Shia Muslims, while many of its critics and opponents are non-Shia.

Headline: Starved, threatened and abused: Parents of freed Hamas hostages give details of ordeal
Author: Alice Cuddy, Tel Aviv

Text: Parents of four young female Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza have told the BBC about how their daughters were abused, including being starved, intimidated and threatened by armed men, and forced to cook and clean.
They recounted how the hostages were held in underground tunnels and buildings, witnessed physical abuse and were made to participate in Hamas propaganda videos, including, in one case, by faking her own death.
They said the women found strength through sharing stories, drawing and keeping a diary.
None of the women have given interviews to the media since their release, and their parents say the full details of what they endured are still emerging. There are also things they can't speak about due to fears it could put the hostages still in Gaza at risk.
Three of the four women whose parents spoke to the BBC were female soldiers kidnapped by Hamas from the Nahal Oz army base near Gaza on 7 October 2023.
The hostages' access to food and their treatment by male guards varied over the 15 months they were held, their parents said. They were moved between locations, rarely seeing sunlight.
"It was very different between the places that she went - it could be a good tunnel, it could be a very bad tunnel. It could be a good house or a bad house," said the father of Agam Berger, 20, a soldier who had been at Nahal Oz.
Some of the places had good food, some had "very bad food... they just tried to survive," Shlomi Berger said.
"They [and their captors] had to run away from one place to another because they are in a war zone there. It was very dangerous to be there," said Orly Gilboa, whose daughter Daniella was also kidnapped from the base.
When Daniella watched the release of three male hostages last week - who came out thin and emaciated - she told her mother: "If I had been released two months ago I would have probably looked like them."
"She got thinner, she lost a lot of her weight through the captivity. But in the last two months they were given a lot of food to gain weight," Ms Gilboa says.
Other parents have also reported significant weight loss. Meirav Leshem Gonen's daughter was taken by Hamas from the Nova music festival.
Romi, 24, was released in the first week of the ceasefire in January - she had lost "20% of her body weight", says her mother.
Ms Gilboa says the hardest thing she endured was seeing a video that suggested her daughter had been killed. Her captors poured powder on her so she looked like she was covered in plaster, as if she was killed in an Israeli military strike.
"I think everyone who saw it believed it, but I just kept telling myself that it can't be," she told the BBC.
The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage.
More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been destroyed or damaged, estimates the UN.
So far, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been exchanged for more than 600 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel under the ceasefire deal that began on 19 January.
Mr Berger says his daughter, Agam, was threatened by her captors and witnessed physical abuse while in captivity.
"Sometimes they tortured other female hostages in front of her eyes," he says, referring specifically to an assault on Amit Soussana, a former hostage who was released in November 2023.
Mr Berger says his daughter told him how they were constantly watched over by armed men, "playing all the time with their guns and their hand grenades".
He says the male captors treated the women with "big disrespect", including forcing them to clean and prepare food.
"That was really bothering her. She's a girl that if she has something to say, she'll say it. She's not shy. And sometimes she told them what she was thinking about them and their behaviour," he says.
He adds that in a small act of resistance, Agam had refused to perform any jobs on the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. The men detaining her accepted this.
They were also not allowed to speak loudly.
"When Agam came [back to Israel] she wanted to speak all the time... After a day, she had no voice because she'd spoken so much," Mr Berger says.
Yoni Levy, whose daughter Naama, 20, was also taken from the army base, says she was sometimes held in locations where there was a TV or radio playing.
Once, Naama saw her father talking on TV. "It gave her a lot of hope and optimism... that nobody would forget her, and we'll do whatever is needed to take her out of this hell."
He says for Naama, the Hamas attack on the army base was "much more traumatic than the captivity itself".
"It may change but at this stage we think that this is the most tragic day that she's talked about," Mr Levy says.
Footage of Naama that day shows her and other female soldiers in bloodstained clothing surrounded by armed men in a room at the base before being forced into a vehicle and taken to Gaza.
The three female soldiers whose parents spoke to the BBC are among five from an all-women unarmed military unit at Nahal Oz freed in the first round of the ceasefire.
Members of the unit, known in Hebrew as Tatzpitaniyot, are tasked with observing the Gaza border and looking for signs of anything suspicious. Survivors and relatives of some of those killed that day say that they had been warning for months that Hamas had been preparing for an attack.
A few days before the 7 October attack, Daniella had been at home on a break from service. She had told her mother then: "Mummy, when I go back to the army, there's going to be a war."
"I didn't think it was going to be such a war and of course that my daughter would be taken hostage," Ms Gilboa says.
Ms Gilboa and the families of the two other observers who spoke to the BBC say they are joining calls for an inquiry into what happened.
They say their daughters remain concerned about the conditions of those still in Gaza and have called for the ceasefire to continue.
Meanwhile, Ms Leshem Gonen says she is still learning what happened to her daughter Romi.
She was shot at the Nova music festival and her mother says she was not properly treated, leaving her with "an open wound where she could see the bone".
"This is something we can know and that she speaks about. The other things, I think it will take time."
Ms Leshem Gonen says Romi described her release in the first week of the truce as "intimidating" and "frightening". She was surrounded by gunmen and crowds. But the moment of their reunion was "so powerful".
The parents also described how their daughters had found ways to get through each day in captivity - through drawing, making notes or sharing stories with each other.
"They wrote as much as they could, every day - what was happening, where were they moving, who were the guards and things like that," says Mr Berger.
While in captivity, the young women had dreamt about the things they wanted to do when they got home: getting a haircut and eating sushi.
Daniella had drawn a butterfly with the word "freedom" while in captivity - she now has that tattooed on her arm.
They are adapting to life back in Israel, and their families say they are taking the recovery step by step.
The moment of reunion with his daughter Naama is still a blur, says Mr Levy, but he remembers the emotion.
"The feeling was that... I will take care of you now, and everything's going to be OK. Daddy's here. That's all. And then everything was quiet."

Headline: Hamas says it will continue releasing Israeli hostages under Gaza deal
Author: David Gritten, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-13T17:28:43.330Z
Text: Hamas has said it is committed to implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel and will continue releasing hostages as scheduled, raising hopes that a resumption of the war can be averted.
Following talks in Cairo, the Palestinian armed group said mediators from Egypt and Qatar had confirmed they would "remove obstacles". Egyptian and Qatari reports also said gaps had been bridged.
An Israeli government spokesman did not comment on the reports but stated that if Hamas did not free three living hostages on Saturday then the ceasefire would end.
Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations.
Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied.
The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and "let hell break out" unless "all of the hostages" were returned by Saturday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Trump's demand and warned: "If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas."
However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend.
On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were "intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials.
After concluding the talks on Thursday morning, Hamas put out a statement saying they focused on the need for all terms of the deal to be fulfilled, particularly regarding deliveries of caravans, tents, heavy construction equipment, medical supplies and fuel.
It added that the talks were "positive" and that the mediators had agreed to work to "remove obstacles and close gaps".
"Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to implementing the agreement as signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timeline."
At the same time, Egyptian state-run Al Qahera TV reported that Egypt and Qatar had successfully "overcome obstacles" and that Israel and Hamas were committed to fully implementing the ceasefire deal.
Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV also said the negotiations had been successful and that mobile homes and heavy machinery would be allowed into Gaza on Thursday.
However, Israeli media then cited the Israeli prime minister's office as calling the Al Jazeera report "fake news" and saying there was "no basis" to it.
Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the prime minister, later clarified the denial, writing on X: "There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no co-ordination for this."
When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was "crystal clear".
"There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages," David Mencer said. "That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday."
"If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end."
War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war.
"When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices," Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.
"I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall."
The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza.
So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal.
The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named.
Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the remaining 59 hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun.
The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

Headline: Two British nationals detained in Iran

Text: Two British nationals - a man and a woman - have been arrested in Iran, the Foreign Office has confirmed.
News of their arrest first came from state-run media in Iran which said they were in custody in the south-eastern city of Kerman, accused of unspecified security-related offences.
It did not name them but published a photograph of them with their faces blurred, meeting the British ambassador, Hugo Shorter, at the prosecutor's office in Kerman on Wednesday.
The Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Iran, saying that British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at "significant risk" of arrest, questioning or detention.
"Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you," the advice says.
Also at the meeting between the Britons and the UK ambassador were Kerman's prosecutor Mehdi Bakhshi and the deputy governor general for security and law enforcement affairs Rahman Jalali, state news agency IRNA reported.
Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency in recent years, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK.
Human rights groups say they are often held for leverage, released only when Iran gets something in return.
In 2023, Iran executed British-Iranian dual national Alireza Akbari, who had been convicted of spying for the UK. He denied the charge and said he had been tortured and forced to confess on camera to crimes he did not commit.
Later that year, environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, a UK-US-Iranian citizen, was among five people released as part of a prisoner swap deal between Iran and the US that also saw $6bn (£4.8bn) of frozen Iranian funds transferred from South Korea.
British-Iranian citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released in 2022 and allowed to leave Iran after the UK settled a long-standing £650m debt owed to Iran.

Headline: Israel seeks another extension for Lebanon withdrawal, source says

Text: Israel is seeking another extension of the deadline for the withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon, a Western diplomatic source says, a request that is likely to raise new concerns in a country with a history of Israeli occupation.
Israeli forces had been due to pull out next week but the source told the BBC Israel wanted its military to stay in five positions there for another 10 days, till 28 February.
The ceasefire deal that ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was brokered by the US and France and came into force on 27 November.
It requires the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from there too.
At the same time, thousands of Lebanese soldiers were expected to be deployed to the region where, for decades, Hezbollah has been the dominant force.
The ceasefire has already been extended once - the initial deadline was 26 January - after Israel said the Lebanese state had not fully implemented the deal. Lebanon accused Israel of delaying its withdrawal.
One of the priorities of the new Lebanese government is to restore the country's territorial sovereignty, and the authorities strongly reject another delay.
President Joseph Aoun insisted on Wednesday that there was "no truth" to reports that another extension had been agreed, his office said. He also "repeatedly stressed Lebanon's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops" by Tuesday.
The continued presence of Israeli troops is a source of concern for many in Lebanon as Israel occupied the country's south for 18 years, between 1982 and 2000.
Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to target Hezbollah, and has vowed to carry out more attacks on the Iran-backed group to stop it from rearming or rebuilding its forces.
On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier at low altitude over the capital Beirut for the first time since the ceasefire began.
Hezbollah, which is a militant, political and social movement, was severely weakened in the conflict with Israel, although it continues to enjoy significant support among Shia Muslims in Lebanon.
The ceasefire deal was widely considered as a surrender by the group, after it saw its infrastructure and weapons arsenal depleted, and hundreds of fighters and key figures killed, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.
The conflict escalated last September, when Israel launched an intense air campaign across Lebanon, assassinated Hezbollah's senior leaders and invaded southern Lebanon.
The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents, Lebanese authorities say. It also caused billions of dollars in destruction and damage.
Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's rocket, mortar and drone attacks, and to remove its weapons and infrastructure from areas along the border.
Hezbollah had launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Text: Israel has warned Hamas it will resume its military operations in Gaza if the Palestinian armed group "does not return our hostages by Saturday," sparking fresh anxiety for people on both sides of the conflict.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks came after Hamas said it would not free more hostages until further notice, claiming Israel had violated the terms of the three-week-old ceasefire deal.
With the fragile agreement to end the fighting under growing strain, Israelis and Palestinians have shared their fears of its possible collapse with BBC News.
On the streets of Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city, 21-year-old Imad Qudaih said "tension and fear" dominate.
"No one wants war to return again," he said from the southern city, where conditions remain "extremely difficult".
Imad said there was anger about Trump's proposal for Gazans to leave the strip, as well as fear of displacement - but he believed Trump's plan was "not going to be achievable" and "is just words".
Displaced from eastern Gaza, Salman Mahmoud Abed said he "hoped to God" the ceasefire would continue.
"We are people who have been displaced and are homeless," he told the BBC.
"We lost our children, and our homes, and we are about to lose our mental health as well.
"There is no normal life, no proper food or any psychological relief.
"We ask Hamas and Israel not to resume the war, because we are tired of the war."
Ali Ismail Royshid - another Palestinian who has been displaced several times, most recently from Jabalia refugee camp - told the BBC: "Enough with the tragedy, enough of the farce."
"We want them to try to keep to the conditions, hold to the ceasefire and stop the war."
Even with the pause in fighting, they were still far from an end to the war, he said, adding: "The war is still there, we are still homeless.
"How can we forget the war while we are still homeless living in tents?"
Abu Ahmed, who was displaced from northern Gaza, said he was scared neither of the war nor of Trump's statements.
"We are not scared of the war, because we have witnessed a lot, and whatever happens, so be it," he said.
"We are staying here and whatever God wants, will happen eventually."
Meanwhile in Israel, Liron Berman, whose twin 27-year-old brothers Gali and Ziv are being held hostage, has just found out that the pair are alive.
"To get the sign of life from my brothers is a lot for us, this is amazing," he told the BBC, his voice shaking with emotion.
"It lifts us up a little bit and we are fighting with urgency to get them out."
But he said their only chance was to keep the deal.
"My family's mission is to make sure the deal to release the hostages will remain. Only through releasing the hostages will the ceasefire stay in place," he says.
Vicki Cohen - whose son Nimrod was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October 2023 - spoke plainly about the situation.
"It is a matter of life and death," she said. "They are in danger any minute."
She said the most recent release of hostages had sharpened fears.
Last week, three male hostages were paraded in front of the cameras by Hamas gunmen during a stage-managed handover inside Gaza. The trio appeared gaunt and sunken-eyed.
"I am so afraid and so worried for my son," she said.
In an appeal to Netanyahu to ensure the hostages' return, she said: "Do the right thing... do what is good for the whole society."
Her concerns were echoed by Dudi Zalmanovich, another relative of one of the hostages still being held captive by Hamas.
His 22-year-old nephew Omer Shem Tov was supposed to be among those due to be freed during the first phase of the ceasefire because he has a health condition.
"This news around the possibility that the deal will stop is really frightening us," Mr Zalmanovich said.
Like Vicki, he said the "very, very bad" physical condition of the recently released hostages had heightened his anxiety.
Now, Mr Zalmanovich said he feared "any excuse" could be used to collapse the deal.

Headline: Israel says Gaza ceasefire will end if Hamas does not free hostages by Saturday

Text: There is growing concern that fighting could resume in Gaza after Israel's prime minister warned Hamas it would end the ceasefire if the Palestinian armed group "does not return our hostages by Saturday".
Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet met on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing freeing more hostages until further notice, claiming Israel had violated the terms of the three-week-old ceasefire deal.
It remains unclear whether Netanyahu is demanding the release of all 76 remaining hostages, or just the three due to be freed this Saturday.
Hamas responded by saying it remained committed to the ceasefire deal and that Israel was "responsible for any complications or delays".
The group has demanded mediators address its list of complaints against Israel, including blocking vital humanitarian aid such as tents - a claim Israel has denied.
It is understood Arab countries are exerting pressure on Hamas to try to get the deal back on track.
Egypt has said it plans to present a "comprehensive vision" for the reconstruction of Gaza that does not involve displacing the population, unlike a proposal put forward by US President Donald Trump.
Hamas's decision to delay this weekend's scheduled release had prompted Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and "let hell break out" unless "all of the hostages" were returned by Saturday.
Following a four-hour meeting of Israel's security cabinet on Tuesday, Netanyahu said in a video statement that he "welcomed President Trump's demand".
He added: "In light of Hamas's announcement regarding its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, last night I instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to amass forces inside - and surrounding - the Gaza Strip.
"This action is being carried out at this hour and will be completed very soon."
He then issued an ultimatum that he said had the security cabinet's unanimous approval.
"If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end, and the IDF will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas."
There were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether Netanyahu meant Hamas should release all the remaining hostages or not.
One source told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz it would be willing to continue the ceasefire if the next group of three hostages were freed as planned on Saturday.
There were then reports that it was a demand to free the nine living hostages remaining from the first phase of the deal.
But later, transport minister and war cabinet member Miri Regev wrote on X: "We made a very clear decision: we adhere to US President Donald Trump's statement regarding the release of the hostages - on Saturday, everyone will be released!"
The IDF meanwhile said it had raised the level of readiness of its Southern Command - which is responsible for operations in Gaza - and that it would be reinforced with additional troops, including reservists.
Some Israeli analysts suggest Israel is trying to do a complicated manoeuvre: showing loyalty to the White House and not collapsing the deal.
They say it is still possible Israel and Hamas can reach a compromise through mediators on this weekend's scheduled round of hostage releases.
Hamas also reiterated on Tuesday its rejection of Trump's controversial plan for the US to take over post-war Gaza and permanently relocate the two million Palestinians living there so that it could be rebuilt and turned into the "Riviera of the Middle East".
Palestinians fear a repeat of the Nakba, or "catastrophe", when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.
Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the occupied West Bank, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN.
Hamas said Trump's remarks were "racist and constitute a call for ethnic cleansing, aimed at liquidating the Palestinian cause and denying our people's inalienable national rights".
The Palestinian Authority and Arab states have also categorically rejected the plan, while the UN warned that any forced displacement would be prohibited under international law and "tantamount to ethnic cleansing".
Netanyahu has praised the president's "revolutionary vision" for Gaza.
Earlier on Tuesday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim told the BBC that the door was open for US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to intervene and get the ceasefire deal back on track.
"We don't wish that this deal will fall apart," he said. "We are doing the maximum to avoid any obstacles, any challenges, and therefore we are ready to hand over prisoners next Saturday if the situation is rectified through the mediators."
He accused Israel of "continuous violations" of the ceasefire deal, including delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to areas in northern Gaza by between 48 and 72 hours and obstructing deliveries of urgently needed food, medical and shelter supplies.
The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza.
So far, 16 living hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal.
The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named.
Negotiations for the ceasefire deal's second phase - which will see the 43 remaining hostages still in captivity released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun.
The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 48,210 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

Headline: Why does Trump want to take over Gaza and could he do it?

Text: Donald Trump has shocked the world by suggesting that the US could "take over" and "own" Gaza, resettling its population in the process.
The proposal could mark the biggest shift in US policy on the Middle East in decades and upend the international consensus on a Palestinian state comprising Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
Trump has suggested that under his plan, Gaza would be handed over to the US by Israel and its residents encouraged to move elsewhere with no right of return.
The proposal has drawn condemnation, including from across the Middle East, close US allies and the United Nations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, welcomed the "revolutionary vision" for Gaza.
If Donald Trump is right about one thing, it is that decades of US diplomacy on Israel and the Palestinians have failed to resolve the conflict.
Peace proposals and presidents have come and gone but the problems have festered. Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the war in Gaza it triggered were the hideous results.
Trump made his millions as a property developer and, with that hat on, made a perfectly valid observation: if Gaza is to be rebuilt, from scratch in some places, it makes little sense for hundreds of thousands of civilians to be sheltering in the rubble.
The task of rebuilding Gaza will be monumental. Unexploded munitions and mountains of debris have to be removed. Water and power lines have to be repaired. Schools, hospitals and shops need to be rebuilt.
Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has said that could take years - and while that goes on, the Palestinians will need to go elsewhere.
However, rather than exploring ways of keeping them close to home, almost certainly in camps in the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, Trump has insisted they should be encouraged to leave - permanently.
Despite fierce pushback from regional leaders, Trump has pressured Jordan and Egypt to accept Gaza's 2.2 million residents - threatening to withhold aid if they refuse. Both nations have rejected the idea, warning it could destabilise the region.
Trump has said that Palestinians would have no right to return to Gaza under his plan.
Instead, he suggested building up to six "safe communities" outside Gaza, saying: "Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is."
Trump believes that in the absence of Gaza's residents, an idyllic, American-owned "Riviera of the Middle East" will rise from the ashes, providing thousands of jobs, investment opportunities, and, ultimately, a place for "the world's people to live."
Where to begin?
Even for a president who spent much of his first term upending US Middle East policy – including moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights – this was an astonishing proposal.
In their wildest imaginations, no US president ever thought that solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict would involve taking over a chunk of Palestinian territory and evicting its population.
To be clear, to do this by force would be a grave violation of international law.
Some Palestinians would likely choose to leave Gaza and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Since October 2023, as many as 150,000 already have.
But others cannot or will not, either because they lack the financial means to do so or because their attachment to Gaza – part of the land they call Palestine – is simply too strong.
Many Gazans are descendants of people who fled or were driven from their homes in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel - a period Palestinians call the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe.
The thought of another will be too painful for many and they will cling to their reduced lives in what remains of Gaza with a fierce determination.
For Palestinians who dream of a state of their own, alongside Israel, the loss of part of it will feel like an amputation.
Gaza has been physically separated from the West Bank since 1948. Previous rounds of negotiations, as well as Trump's 2020 "Vision for Peace", included plans for tunnels or railways that might link the two.
Now Trump is basically telling the Palestinians to give up on Gaza once and for all.
Arab leaders have accused him of attempting to erase Palestinian claims to Gaza entirely.
While he does not appear to be advocating the forced deportation of civilians - which is against international law - Trump is clearly encouraging Palestinians to leave.
Palestinian officials have already accused Israel of blocking the supply of tens of thousands of caravans which could help Gazans to stay put in less damaged parts of the territory while reconstruction takes place elsewhere.
The Arab countries that Trump says should accept as many as 1.8 million Gazan refugees, mainly Egypt and Jordan, have expressed outrage.
Both have enough problems of their own without this added burden. On Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty reaffirmed Cairo's refusal to accept any forced displacement, saying Egypt "will not participate in an injustice against the Palestinians".
Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years before it was seized by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War.
It is still considered occupied by Israel under international law, which Israel disputes. It says the occupation ended in 2005, when it unilaterally dismantled Jewish settlements and pulled out its military.
Around three quarters of UN members recognise Gaza as part of a sovereign state of Palestine, though the US does not.
Cut off from the outside world by fences and an Israeli maritime blockade, it has never felt like a truly independent place.
Nothing and no one moves in or out without Israel's permission, and an international airport - opened amid much fanfare in 1998 - was destroyed by Israel in 2001 during the second Palestinian uprising.
Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza, citing security reasons, after Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.
Long before the latest war, Palestinians had come to regard Gaza as an open prison.
It goes without saying that the US has no legal claim to the territory and it is not at all clear how Trump intends to impose American rule.
As with his bullish claims about US control over Greenland or the Panama Canal, it is not yet clear whether Trump really means it or if the comments represent an opening, outlandish bargaining position ahead of a bruising set of negotiations on Gaza's future.
Various plans have been discussed for the post-war governance of Gaza.
In December, the two main Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, agreed to form a joint committee to oversee its administration - an agreement which has so far come to nothing.
At other times, discussions have focused on the creation of an international peacekeeping force, possibly made up of troops from Arab countries.
Last month, Reuters reported that the UAE, US and Israel had discussed the formation of a temporary administration in Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA), which already has control in parts of the West Bank, was ready to take over.
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously publicly insisted that the PA will have no role to play in running post-war Gaza.
In a limited sense, American boots are already on the ground. A US security firm has employed around 100 former US special forces to man a vital checkpoint south of Gaza City and screen the vehicles of Palestinians returning to the north for weapons.
Egyptian security personnel have also been seen at the same checkpoint.
These could be the first, tentative signs of an expanded international - and possibly US-led - presence in Gaza.
But that is hardly a US takeover, something that would require a large-scale military intervention in the Middle East. That is the sort of thing Trump has long told voters he wants to avoid - and both the president and the White House later said they believe the proposal could be achieved without US soldiers being deployed to Gaza.
Negotiations on phase two of the two-week-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have barely begun but it is hard to see how Trump's bombshell remarks will help to advance them.
If Hamas feels the end product of this whole process is a depopulated Gaza - devoid not just of Hamas, but of all Palestinians - it may conclude there is nothing to talk about and hold on to the remaining hostages it took on 7 October 2023.
Hamas said on Monday that it would delay the release of the next group of hostages due to be freed over claims Israel had violated the terms of the ceasefire deal.
Netanyahu, in turn, said Israel would end the ceasefire and send troops back into Gaza if Hamas does not release the hostages.
Netanyahu's critics have accused him of looking for excuses to blow up the negotiations and resume the war. They are bound to conclude that, with these comments, Trump is a willing accomplice.
On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister's right-wing backers have expressed satisfaction with the US takeover plan, potentially reducing the risk of cabinet resignations and making Netanyahu's immediate political future appear more assured.
In that sense, Trump has given Netanyahu a powerful incentive to keep the ceasefire going.
Asked whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would have an announcement to make in four weeks' time.
That remark has caused alarm among Palestinians, for whom such an announcement would inevitably be seen as another nail in the coffin for a two-state solution.
Jordan's King Abdullah, who met Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has already warned against any attempts to "annex land and displace the Palestinians".
Jordan and Egypt fear that any acceptance of Trump's plan could provoke massive popular backlash and fuel new instability in the region.
Recognising the legitimacy of Israel's settlements in the West Bank would be a hugely consequential move. Most of the rest of the world regards them as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
During previous rounds of peace talks, negotiators recognised that Israel would get to hold onto large settlement blocs as part of a final agreement, probably in exchange for small chunks of Israeli territory.
In 2020, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords, which secured the historic normalisation of relations between Israel and two Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.
The UAE signed that agreement on the understanding Israel would not annex parts of the West Bank - an understanding which may now be in jeopardy.

Editorial curbs are often enforced through self-censorship, rather than coercion or repression. Outlets linked to the state take a strong pro-government line, while private media are more likely to criticise specific government policies.
TV is the most popular medium. The market is dominated by state-affiliated Jordan TV and Al-Mamlaka TV, and  privately-owned Roya TV and Roya TV News.
Jordan is home to many commercial satellite TV stations, most of them entertainment-based, as well as outlets catering to foreign audiences, including major Libyan and Iraqi satellite networks.
There are dozens of radio stations, including privately-owned music stations. BBC World Service radio in Arabic can be heard on FM.
The printed press has declined, but there is a burgeoning online media scene. Social media are often used for news consumption. Political, religious and media figures are among Jordan's main online influencers.
The press law gives officials the power to block websites. News sites must have a licence from the government.
There were 10.3 million internet users by February 2024, comprising 91% of the population (Datareportal.com).

Headline: WFP says worker died in detention in Houthi-controlled Yemen
Author: Alex Smith, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-11T13:49:53.327Z
Text: A World Food Programme (WFP) worker has died while in detention in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen, according to the UN agency.
The WFP said the man was one of seven Yemeni staff "arbitrarily detained" by local authorities since 23 January. It is unclear when or how he died.
His death was announced a day after the UN said it would be pausing all operations in the northern governorate of Saada, a stronghold of the Iran-backed Houthi movement, over safety concerns.
The UN said it followed the detention by the Houthis of eight additional UN personnel, including six in Saada. More than 60 staff from the UN, international non-governmental organisations and foreign embassies were already being held.
"This extraordinary and temporary measure seeks to balance the imperative to stay and deliver with the need to have the safety and security of the UN personnel and its partners guaranteed," UN spokesman Farhan Haq said.
In a post on X on Tuesday, WFP executive director Cindy McCain said the worker who died in detention was named Ahmed and that he was a "devoted humanitarian and father of 2" who had helped deliver life-saving food assistance.
According to the WFP, he had been working for the agency since 2017.
McCain said she was "heartbroken and outraged by the tragic loss".
"Humanitarians are #NotATarget," she added.
There was no immediate comment from Houthi authorities.
Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated 10 years ago, when the Houthis seized control of the north-west from the internationally-recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US and UK intervened in an effort to restore its rule.
The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.
Last month, the UN said it was actively engaging with senior Houthi officials to try to secure the release of all its detained employees.
Even though they provide a vital lifeline, UN agencies have regularly had problems reaching people in more remote areas outside the major towns and cities, with Houthi officials regularly reported to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
Human rights groups have also accused the movement of kidnapping, torturing and arbitrarily detaining hundreds of civilians.
In June, the Houthis claimed they had dismantled an "American-Israeli spy network" following the detention of 13 UN staff, as well as more than 50 NGO workers and an embassy staff member. The UN human rights chief said the allegation was baseless.
The UN Security Council is due to discuss the situation in Yemen later this week.
Last month, US President Donald Trump put the Houthis back on his country's list of designated foreign terrorist organisations over their attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel.

Text: The Israeli military has said an elderly Israeli man was killed during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and that his body is being held hostage in Gaza.
Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour, 86, was abducted by gunmen at his home in Kibbutz Kissufim. His wife, Mazal, managed to escape.
The military said the decision to confirm Shlomo's death was based on intelligence gathered in recent months and was approved by an expert committee of the ministry of health.
His name is on the Israeli government's list of 33 hostages to be released by Hamas during the first phase of a ceasefire deal that is coming under growing strain.
So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails since 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages.
The remaining 17 Israeli hostages - two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50 - are supposed to be released over the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of those hostages are dead but not named them.
On Monday, Hamas warned that it would postpone the scheduled release of the next group of three this weekend unless US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators addressed what it said were Israeli violations of the deal, including delays in allowing in shelters and medical supplies.
The threat prompted US President Donald Trump to propose that Israel cancel the deal and "let hell break out" if Hamas did not release all the hostages by midday on Saturday.
Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said Hamas's move was a complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and told the Israeli military to prepare for any possible scenario in Gaza.
Shlomo Mansour was born in Baghdad and as a child survived the Farhud pogrom against the Iraqi capital's Jewish community in 1941.
He emigrated to Israel with his family at the age of 13 and went on to help found Kibbutz Kissufim, where he worked in the chicken coop and eyewear factory.
On 7 October 2023, hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen stormed the Israel's Gaza perimeter fence and attacked many nearby Israeli communities, including Kissufim. They killed about 1,200 people were killed and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.
Shlomo and Mazal - who had five children and 12 grandchildren - fled to their home's safe room that day, but a group of gunmen fired at the door and were able to break it open. Mazal hid in the bathroom, but they found Shlomo, handcuffed him, and took him out of the house.
On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had informed the Mansour family that he was then murdered by the gunmen and that they took his body back to Gaza as a hostage.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife, Sara, sent their heartfelt condolences to the family following the "bitter news".
"We will neither rest nor be silent until he is returned for burial in Israel," he added.
"We will continue to take determined and relentless action until we return all of our hostages - the living and the deceased."
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents some of the hostages' relatives, said: "We share in the profound grief of the Mansour family."
On Monday, in response to Hamas's threat to postpone the next hostage release, the forum called on mediators to help restore and implement the ceasefire deal effectively so that the remaining 76 hostages are brought home.
"Recent evidence from those released, as well as the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday, leaves no room for doubt - time is of the essence, and all hostages must be urgently rescued from this horrific situation," it warned.
The Israeli government was furious at the emaciated state of Eli Sharabi, 52, Ohad Ben Ami, 56, and Or Levy, 34, who were paraded in front of a crowd in Deir al-Balah before being handed over to the Red Cross.
An Israeli doctor who treated Mr Sharabi and Mr Levy said they were in a "poor medical condition", while a hospital official said Mr Ben Ami was in a "severe nutritional sate and had lost a significant amount of his body weight".
Meanwhile, the family of another hostage, Alon Ohel, 24, said on Sunday they had received their first indication in 16 months that he was alive from Mr Levy and Mr Sharabi, who were held captive along with him.
"Since his kidnapping, Alon has been held in harsh conditions in Hamas's underground tunnels, without daylight or access to basic human necessities," a statement said.
"We have been informed that Alon is wounded in his eye. Additionally, he is being held in particularly severe captivity conditions, with serious food shortages."
The Ohel family also urged the Israeli government to advance negotiations with Hamas on the ceasefire deal's second phase, which should see the remaining living hostages released, a permanent ceasefire, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
More than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Headline: Paul Adams: Why the Gaza ceasefire is under growing strain
Author: Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent

Text: Why has Hamas announced a delay just days before it is due to release the next group of hostages?
In one of its official statements, released on Telegram, the group called its announcement a "warning" to Israel and said it was giving mediators "ample time to pressure the occupation [Israel] into fulfilling its obligations".
It said the "door remains open" for the next scheduled releases to go ahead on Saturday.
The group appears to be giving time for the impasse to be resolved.
But what exactly is the impasse?
Hamas lists a series of complaints, from delaying the return of displaced people, continuing to open fire on them and failing to allow the entry of certain types of humanitarian aid.
Other Palestinian officials not connected with Hamas have cited Israel's reluctance to allow caravans into Gaza to house the vast numbers of Palestinians whose homes have been destroyed.
At a time when the Israeli government is openly discussing ways to encourage civilians to leave Gaza, the failure to give permits for badly needed temporary accommodation is bound to stoke Palestinian fears of expulsion.
Fears exacerbated, almost every day, by Donald Trump.
What began as an apparently off-the-cuff suggestion that most Palestinians should leave while the Gaza Strip is rebuilt has morphed into the president's demand that all should leave and that the US should take over and run Gaza.
As Trump continues to double down on his incendiary suggestion, Hamas may be wondering whether it's worth engaging in phase two of the ceasefire talks. What exactly are the talks for?
If Trump is serious, the Palestinians know that it will fall to Israel to make sure that Gaza is devoid of civilians. Depriving them of shelter won't be enough. It will almost certainly require force.
Now Trump has said that if all the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday he will propose cancelling the ceasefire and "all hell" will break out.
But he did say he was speaking for himself and "Israel can override it".
Faced with the possible resumption of war, Hamas may be wondering what incentive there is to release the remaining hostages.
For relatives and friends of the hostages, the current impasse, and Trump's noisy intervention, is cause for fresh anxiety.
"Each of these statements or announcements, of course, make Hamas more stubborn," Dudi Zalmanovich told the BBC. His wife's nephew, Omer Shem Tov, is still being held by Hamas.
"I would prefer him to be less proactive," Mr Zalmanovich said of Trump.
Israel has its own suspicions about the rationale behind Hamas's threatened delay.
The spectacle of emaciated hostages being released at the weekend has raised fears that Hamas may not want the world to see others in even worse condition.
On top of the televised scenes of well-armed Hamas fighters parading in broad daylight, and warnings from the former US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, that the group has recruited as many soldiers as it's lost during the war, not all Israelis believe the ceasefire can – or even should – hold.
It's too early to say whether this carefully negotiated, staged process is about to collapse – as many have predicted it will – but after a mostly positive start, it's under increasing strain.

Three hostages held in Gaza are due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz called the Hamas announcement a "complete violation of the ceasefire agreement".
Key Israeli ally US President Donald Trump has suggested the ceasefire should be cancelled if "all" the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday.
"I'd say they ought to be returned by 12 o'clock on Saturday... all of them, not in dribs and drabs, not two and one and three and four and two," he said.
"I'm speaking for myself," he stressed. "Israel can override it."
Seventy-three hostages taken during Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, and three others taken a decade earlier, are still being held in Gaza.
If hostages were not released, Trump added, "All hell is going to break out."
Asked whether he meant retaliation from Israel, he said: "You'll find out, and they'll find out too. Hamas will find out what I mean."
Katz said he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces to "prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza and to protect the communities".
"We will not allow a return to the reality of 7 October," the Israeli defence minister added.
Hamas's announcement came shortly before people gathered in Tel Aviv to mark the 24th birthday of Israeli hostage Alon Ohel, his second in captivity.
He was taken hostage from the Nova festival on 7 October 2023.
Mia Goldstein, an attendee at the rally for Ohel, told the BBC there should be "immense pressure" to get the rest of hostages out, adding Hamas's delay was "horrifying".
Michal Neeman, who took part in a protest in Tel Aviv following the announcement from Hamas, said the hostages "should have been out a few months ago. You see the situation, they are dying there, and their blood is on this government's hands".
UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said "any delays" to the fragile ceasefire deal would be an issue and all parties involved should adhere to their previously stated agreements and timelines.
Hamas has said the "door remains open" to the exchange going ahead on Saturday if Israel "complies" with its obligations, according to news agency AFP.
Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to the north of Gaza, firing on people and failing to allow in agreed humanitarian aid.
The group's announcement did not refer to Trump or US policy but it comes after strong remarks made last week by the US president about the US taking ownership of Gaza and redeveloping it.
His proposal included the resettlement of Palestinians outside the territory and was praised as "revolutionary and creative" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The militant group's statement is the latest in a series of recriminatory actions between the two sides.
Israel delayed by two days allowing displaced Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza, accusing Hamas of reneging on a commitment to free a female Israeli civilian hostage.
Israel also recently briefly delayed buses taking Palestinian prisoners to be released into the occupied West Bank, after expressing anger over the way in which hostages were released through crowds of spectators in Gaza hours earlier.
On Friday, Hamas exceeded by a short time a deadline to release the names of hostages to be freed on Saturday - as required under the ceasefire - prompting concern in Israel. This came after it accused Israel of failing to abide by its commitment to boost the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza –contradicting what had been described by the UN's humanitarian chief as a "massive surge".
Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 prisoners.
By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead.
Hamas took 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked in October 2023. Israel launched a military campaign in response, killing at least 48,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Headline: Anger over Israel's arrest of East Jerusalem bookshop owners

Text: An Israeli police raid on a well-known chain of Palestinian bookshops in occupied East Jerusalem and the detention of their owners has shocked many people in the city's cultural, journalistic and diplomatic communities, who have described it as heavy handed and unjustified.
Mahmoud Muna and his nephew, Ahmad, have been detained since Sunday on broad charges of disrupting public order. Their lawyer, Nasser Odeh, said they had been kept overnight in freezing conditions.
An application to further detain them under house arrest and ban them from their Educational Bookshop stores was also made by police, Mr Odeh said.
The men run three bookshops which are popular with tourists, journalists and diplomats.
They specialise in books, newspapers and comics about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Middle Eastern history and culture. Between them, the three shops have hundreds of publications in several languages and are a focal point of the city's cultural scene.
But, according to the men's families, on Sunday afternoon, plain clothes police raided two of the shops on Salah ad-Din Street, without warning.
Using online translating applications, they removed any books with the words "Palestine" or "Palestinian" in the title, as well as publications showing the red, green and white Palestinian flag.
Among the publications seized were recently released books on the conflict in Gaza as well as books featuring work by the artist Banksy and a children's colouring book about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.
An Israeli police statement said the two men were arrested on suspicion of "selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism".
The statement said that police would "continue their efforts to thwart incitement and support for terrorism, as well as apprehend those involved in offences that threaten the security of Israel's citizens".
That justification for raiding the bookstores and arresting their owners has been roundly condemned by their supporters and customers as another disturbing assault on Palestinian cultural institutions, after previous actions against theatres and educational facilities.
Nathan Thrall, the Pulitzer prize-winning American author, launched his book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy, at the Educational Bookshop and is a friend of the owners.
Outside their court hearing he said: "This is part of a long-standing policy of crushing any perceived assertion of Palestinian nationalism in East Jerusalem... so they went into the store and took any book with the name 'Palestine' on it."
He added: "Only an ideology as thin as paper is threatened by the words on a page."
Other supporters, chanting slogans calling for the men's release, said the confiscation of books and other literary material raised dark images from history where authoritarian regimes often began their assault on freedoms and minority rights with such actions.
Although the men remain in custody, amid growing calls for them to be released and the presence of several diplomats from European and global consulates at the court, one of the stores later re-opened and several people were soon passing by to express their support.

Headline: Israel troops withdraw from corridor that split Gaza in two

Text: Israeli troops have withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor - a military zone cutting off the north of the Gaza Strip from the south.
Hundreds of Palestinians in cars and on carts laden with mattresses and other goods began returning to northern Gaza following the pull-out - often to scenes of utter destruction.
The Israeli withdrawal is in line with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement of 19 January under which 16 Israeli hostages and 566 Palestinian prisoners have so far been freed.
By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead.
Hamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, triggering the Gaza war.
At least 48,189 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says.
On Sunday, crowds of Palestinians were seen traversing the Netzarim Corridor - mostly moving north to see what had happened to their abandoned homes.
"What we saw was a catastrophe, horrific destruction. The [Israeli] occupation destroyed all the homes, shops, farms, mosques, universities and the courthouse," Osama Abu Kamil, a resident of al-Maghraqa just north of Netzarim, told the AFP news agency.
The 57-year-old, who had been forced to live for more than a year in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, said he now planned to "set up a tent for me and my family next to the rubble of our house".
"We have no choice," he added.
Mahmoud al-Sarhi, another displaced Palestinian, told AFP that for him "arriving at the Netzarim Corridor meant death until this morning".
He said this was "the first time I saw our destroyed house", referring to his home in the nearby Zeitun area.
"The entire area is in ruins. I cannot live here," he added.
About 700,000 residents of northern Gaza fled to southern areas at the start of the war, when the Israeli military issued mass evacuation orders before launching a ground invasion of the Palestinian territory.
Many of those displaced were subsequently forced to move multiple times after Israeli forces pushed into southern Gaza, too.
They were also prevented from returning to their homes through the Netzarim Corridor, stretching from the Gaza-Israel border to the Mediterranean Sea.
Israeli forces partially withdrew from the west of the corridor last month and the first Palestinians - pedestrians - were allowed to walk along the coastal Rashid Street as they crossed into northern Gaza.
Those on vehicles have to use Salah al-Din Street and undergo screening for weapons by US and Egyptian security contractors.
The Israel Defense Forces have not officially commented on Sunday's withdrawal from the eastern part of the corridor, which will leave it in control of Gaza's borders, but not the road that had cut it in half.
The Haaretz newspaper says the Hamas-run Gaza interior ministry has been urging people to "exercise caution and adhere to the existing movement guidelines for their safety".
The troop withdrawal comes as an Israeli delegation is expected to fly to Qatar which has been moderating talks between the two sides in the Gaza war.
The Israeli government has previously said the delegation will initially discuss "technical matters" regarding the first phase of the ceasefire deal, rather than the more challenging second phase which is meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the exchange of all remaining living hostages in Gaza for more Palestinian prisoners and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
That will require further direction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently became the first foreign leader to meet US President Donald Trump since his return to the White House.
During the trip, in the most dramatic shift in US policy regarding Gaza in decades, Trump called for the removal of the territory's entire civilian population and the development of what he called "The Riviera of the Middle East".
Convening his first cabinet meeting since returning to Israel over the weekend, Netanyahu said Trump had come up with a "completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel".
"A revolutionary, creative vision - and we are discussing it," he was quoted as saying in an official readout of the meeting. "He [Trump] is very determined to carry it out. It also opens up many possibilities for us."
Trump's proposal, which would be a crime under international law, has been almost universally rejected, including by Arab states.
The Saudi foreign ministry said on Saturday that it would not accept "any infringement on the Palestinians' unalienable rights, and any attempts at displacement," accusing Israel of "ethnic cleansing".
Egypt has also rejected any idea of the removal of the Palestinian population and has said it is calling an emergency summit of the Arab League on 27 February to discuss what it called "serious" Palestinian developments.

Headline: What will anger at sight of gaunt hostages mean for a fragile ceasefire?

Text: The sight of Eli Sharabi being interviewed on stage, surrounded by Hamas fighters, has caused heartbreak and fury in equal measure amongst Israelis.
"How do you feel?" he is asked by a masked interviewer. "I feel very happy today to return to... my wife and daughters", he answers, seemingly unaware they were killed in Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.
The scene was broadcast live around the world, the stage-managed handover of hostages, to send a message.
The ranks of armed fighters, the banner in Arabic, Hebrew and English declaring "We are the flood... the war's next day" - all filmed on modern camera equipment - says to the world they are still in charge in the Gaza Strip and intend to remain so.
In previous exchanges, Hamas have also sought to give the impression that they had taken good care of those they had kidnapped.
It was not possible this time.
All three men looked gaunt and sunken-eyed. As their images were broadcast into Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, the mood changed from one of celebration to anguish.
"It's complicated," said 21-year-old Ruth Senderovich, who was watching on the big screens. "It's the greatest joy that I've had in a while, and it's also devastating because you see men that were leaders of the family, they were fathers, and now you see broken men."
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel "will not gloss over the shocking scenes", and that action would be taken accordingly, without specifying what that would be.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which facilitates the transfers, said it was "increasingly concerned about the conditions surrounding release operations" - calling for them to be "dignified and private".
But it is not only Hamas who have come under fierce criticism for the condition of the people they have been releasing.
Shortly after the three hostages were freed, 183 Palestinians - some serving long sentences for their part in the killings of Israelis, others held without charge - left Israeli jails.
One of those being released was Jamal al-Tawil, the former mayor of al-Bireh. He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prisons, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings. Recently he had been on hunger strike to protest against his detention without charge.
His daughter, who was herself recently released from prison, claimed that he was beaten in the final moments before his release. He had to be carried from the bus to the hospital while connected to a ventilator.
According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, seven of those being released from Israeli jails needed hospital treatment following their imprisonment.
There have been numerous reports since 7 October 2023, accusing the Israeli authorities of abusing Palestinian prisoners.
The question now is what impact, if any, Saturday's releases will have on the fragile ceasefire deal.
Israel has said it is sending negotiators to Qatar to discuss "technical issues", before they begin talks around the next phase. It has also warmly welcomed the suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Gaza would be emptied of Palestinians.
Hamas, meanwhile, has accused Israel of a "lack of commitment" regarding the ceasefire, but said that the group is still ready to join any talks.
Hamas also released a slickly produced video of the release of the three hostages. Filmed in underground tunnels, apparently learning they are to be released. They speak to the camera, thanking God and then putting on uniforms with their own photos on them.
The release of the video was soon followed by a statement from the families asking for it not to be broadcast.
For all the anger about the condition of those being held, there was another conclusion that many have drawn from today. A deal to secure their freedom - and a permanent end to the fighting - cannot come soon enough.
For in the gaunt, haunted faces of those being freed, was written the cost of delay.

Headline: Hostages freed and prisoners released in latest ceasefire exchange

Text: Hamas has freed three Israeli hostages in Gaza, while Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners in the latest exchange as part of an internationally brokered ceasefire deal.
The three hostages - Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy - were handed over to the Red Cross on Saturday morning before reuniting with their families in Israel.
Concerns have been raised about their wellbeing, with Mr Sharabi's family - who live in the UK - describing their shock at his "gaunt" appearance.
Returning Palestinian prisoners were greeted with scenes of celebration at Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Representatives claimed they all needed "medical care", without giving specifics.
So far, 16 Israeli hostages and 566 prisoners have been freed since the ceasefire began on 19 January.
By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead.
Five Thai hostages have also been released during this period following a separate agreement.
As Mr Sharabi, Mr Ben Ami and Mr Levy were handed over to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, crowds lined up, cordoned off by a row of armed fighters, to watch and film on mobile phones, as Hamas and Palestinian flags flew.
A Hamas official and Red Cross representative signed paperwork on a stage to complete the handover. The hostages were then paraded on stage, flanked by men with guns. The three men posed holding certificates and answered questions into a microphone, before waving as they were ushered into Red Cross vehicles.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed horror at the physical state of the men who he said were "returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained".
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also criticised the men's state, saying "we have seen again what the monsters of Hamas are".
He also accused Hamas of "repeated violations" of the ceasefire deal, without providing specifics.
Speaking to BBC Arabic on Saturday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the latest release of Israeli hostages had been carried out in a "civilised manner".
He also accused Israel of "dragging its feet" on implementing humanitarian relief agreed as part of the ceasefire.
Netanyahu's co-ordinator of prisoners and missing persons said Israel treated the issues with "great severity" and would raise them with ceasefire mediators and take action.
Mr Sharabi's brother-in-law, Steve Brisley, told the BBC that having confirmation he is alive is "what we've been working toward for the last 16 months".
It was "incredibly difficult" to see him "thin, gaunt" and being paraded by Hamas, Mr Brisley said. "It's the light that's gone from his eyes that's really struck home for me."
Eli Sharabi, 52, was taken from Kibbutz Beeri with his brother, Yossi, whose death has since been confirmed. Eli's British-born wife, Lianne, and two British-Israeli daughters, Noiya and Yahel, were murdered in the attack.
During his release, Mr Sharabi was filmed saying he was "very happy today to return to...my wife and daughters", adding to concerns he was unaware his family had been killed.
In a statement, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: "I shared the relief of so many at Eli Sharabi's release earlier today but was dismayed to see his frail condition and the circumstances of his release."
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that "the disturbing images" of the release "serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt - there is no time to waste for the hostages! We must get them all out, down to the very last hostage".
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which facilitated the handover, said it was "increasingly concerned about the conditions surrounding release operations".
"We strongly urge all parties, including the mediators, to take responsibility to ensure that future releases are dignified and private," it said.
Later on Saturday, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners. More than 70 are serving life or long sentences, and 111 are Gazans detained during the war. Seven are due to be deported.
Seven of the released prisoners were admitted to hospital in Ramallah because of poor health, the Palestinian Prisoners' Club told AFP.
"All the prisoners who were released today are in need of medical care, treatment, and examinations as a result of the brutality they were subjected to during the past months," the group's Abdullah al-Zaghari said.
One of those released was Jamal al-Tawil, 61, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of al-Bireh, who has spent more than 19 years in and out of Israeli prisons.
His daughter Bushra al-Tawil was freed in an earlier prisoner release in January.
Both father and daughter were most recently held without charge, media reported.
Khadra al-Daghma, the mother of another released Palestinian prisoner, described feeling "so happy, overjoyed" having seen her son for the first time in 15 years.
"My heart is filled with happiness," she told a reporter in Gaza, adding that her son, Ammar Fadel al-Daghma, had "changed a lot" and was "not the same".
According to the Israeli Prison Service, he was detained for offences including arson, attempted murder and service to an illegal organisation.
Hamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, triggering the war.
At least 47,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says.
Ohad Ben Ami, 56, was also taken from Kibbutz Beeri, along with his wife, Raz. She was later released by Hamas.
Mr Ben Ami, an accountant, is "known for his good judgment and sense of humour", according to the Hostages Families Forum.
Or Levy, 34, a computer programmer from Rishon LeZion, a city south of Tel Aviv, fled the Nova festival with his wife Eynav, when gunmen attacked the event.
Mr Levy was taken hostage and Eynav's body was found in a bomb shelter where the couple had been hiding.
In a statement, Mr Levy's family said: "Our hearts tremble and our minds struggle to comprehend the sight of Or, who has returned to us in such a devastating state. His face bears witness to the hell he endured during 491 days in the hands of Hamas monsters.
"After an unbearable period of darkness, we can finally embrace him again and begin healing his body and spirit," the statement said.
On Friday, Hamas accused Israel of failing to abide by its commitment to boost the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza as part of the ceasefire deal.
The head of Hamas's media office in Gaza, Salama Marouf said "the humanitarian situation remains catastrophic due to Israeli obstruction".
He said only 8,500 out of an expected 12,000 aid lorries had entered Gaza since 19 January, and medical equipment and shelter supplies had been deliberately delayed.
The allegation contradicts UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who on Thursday said 10,000 lorries with food, medicine and tents had crossed into Gaza since the start of the ceasefire.
Saturday's exchange took place as US President Donald Trump continued to push his widely criticised proposal to move all Palestinians from Gaza and redevelop it as an international travel destination.
His announcement - for the US to "take over" the Gaza Strip, resettle its Palestinian population and turn the territory into the "Riviera of the Middle East" - has complicated talks on the planned next stage of the ceasefire.
But Israeli negotiators are still expected to meet mediators in Qatar later on Saturday.
Trump's idea was strongly condemned by Arab countries and the UN.

Headline: Oscar-nominated West Bank feature director says films 'can be part of change'
Author: Mallory Moench, BBC News

Text: A Palestinian and an Israeli sit in a West Bank village at night.
They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability.
For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality.
Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages.
The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature.
It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.
In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death.
"It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this," Yuval told the BBC.
"I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now."
Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years.
Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against "illegal construction", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot.
Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land.
On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN.
More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe.
In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence – the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006.
Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen.
Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a "title deed" to the West Bank and "there's no such thing" as occupation or settlements.
When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time.
The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there.
According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the "expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert".
Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages.
In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers.
Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army.
A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: "We have no other land."
The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: "You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day."
The film explores Basel and Yuval's friendship as well. Though they are around the same age and share similar values, their inequality is ever-present.
While Yuval can travel freely in Israel and the West Bank, Basel cannot travel into Israel without a permit, as part of what it says are security measures.
In the film, Basel laments that although he studied law, he could only find work in construction in Israel, and when he thinks about it too hard, "I feel this huge depression."
The film does not shy away from the tension created by Yuval's identity, with one Palestinian asking him: "How can we remain friends, when you come here, and it could be your brother or friend who destroyed my home?"
Yuval told the BBC he felt "responsibility for what is happening to Basel's community" because "at the end of the day, the fuel in the bulldozers is my tax money".
Last year, Yuval faced a backlash for his acceptance speech for the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival, alongside Basel, in which he criticised a "situation of apartheid" and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
US filmmaker Ben Russell, who was there and wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, said he stood against "genocide" in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide.
German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said the statements were "shockingly one-sided and characterised by a deep hatred of Israel", while Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner posted on social media that it was an "intolerable relativisation" and that "antisemitism has no place in Berlin".
Israel's public broadcaster called Yuval's comments antisemitic.
Yuval, who said he received death threats, told the BBC he was "very angry" at the label, which was "emptying this term of meaning at a time when antisemitism is rising on the right wing and on the left wing".
He said it was "absurd" to hear the criticism when most of his family was killed in the Holocaust, adding that learning from this history "should tell us to fight against dehumanisation… no matter who is the victim".
Despite winning several international awards, No Other Land is self-distributing in the US because it has not found an official distributor there – rare for a documentary which has been nominated for an Oscar.
One of the film's last scenes is from 13 October 2023, when Basel recorded a settler shooting his cousin, whose hands appear empty, in the stomach. In other footage, settlers throw rocks at homes while soldiers watch.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the shooting case was transferred to the state attorney's office, which the BBC approached for comment.
Currently in Masafer Yatta, Basel said settlers have "unlimited power" and there is a "daily level of harassment".
He said there were three major settler attacks in January, including on a 72-year-old taken to hospital after he was hit in the head with sticks, and around 15 people arrested in the two days before 30 January while grazing their sheep or chasing away settlers' sheep. Israel Police did not reply to a BBC request for comment.
The UK has sanctioned three settler outposts and four organisations it says are supporting violence against West Bank communities. Yuval called on the UK to sanction all settlers, believing that would "truly be a deterrent".
A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC the foreign secretary "has been clear with Israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settlement expansion".
"We have regularly taken action against settler violence, including through targeted sanctions, and will continue to do all we can to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected and that those responsible for violence are held to account," the statement read.
Yuval said: "I really believe there is no other way forward, other than reaching a just, fair political solution where Palestinians can be free, truly free, and our people, both of them, will have security and self-determination.
"It really makes me angry, not only that my government is going in the other way, but that the world is allowing it to happen for so long."
In the film, Basel recalls a seven-minute visit by Tony Blair to his village – after which Israel cancelled demolition orders there.
"This is a story about power," he says.
Now, Basel gets "strength and power from the people around me", making him want to not give up.
"One water drop doesn't make change," he says during a protest in the film, "but keep dropping the water and it will make change."

Headline: Israeli soldier jailed for abusing Palestinian detainees from Gaza

Text: An Israeli military court has sentenced a soldier to seven months in prison after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military detention centre.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the reservist, who it did not name, was convicted over "several incidents in which he punched the detainees with his fists and used his weapon while they were handcuffed and blindfolded".
"These acts were committed in the presence of other soldiers, some of whom called on him to stop, and were even documented on the defendant's mobile phone," it added.
The Haaretz newspaper said he was the first soldier convicted of abusing Gazans held during the war with Hamas.
He had made the Palestinians say demeaning phrases and make animal noises, and beat them while they were bound and blindfolded, Haaretz reported.
It also cited the Beit Lid Military Court as saying the soldier admitted to three counts of aggravated abuse and one count of unbecoming conduct as part of a plea deal with prosecutors.
They related to four separate incidents between January and June 2024, when he was guarding lorries transporting detainees, it said.
According to Haaretz, the court found an unspecified number of masked soldiers, whose identities remain unknown, had also participated in the abuse.
In addition to the prison term, the convicted soldier was also given a suspended sentence and demoted to the rank of private, according to the IDF.
"Soldiers have a duty to use the force entrusted to them in accordance with IDF values and orders, at all times and in times of war in particular," the IDF said.
The Sde Teiman detention facility was set up after the start of the Gaza war 15 months ago. Since then, it has been at the centre of reports of serious abuses.
In July, far-right protesters broke into Sde Teiman after Israeli military police went there to question nine reservists suspected of raping a detainee and causing a life-threatening injury to him. Several of the reservists were subsequently arrested.
In October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been "subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence".
Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was "fully committed to international legal standards". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 47,550 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
According to the Israeli rights group HaMoked, 1,802 Palestinians from Gaza are currently being held as "unlawful combatants" in Israeli prisons. The figure does not include detainees being held by the military.

Headline: Trump says Israel will hand over Gaza to US after fighting ends

Text: US President Donald Trump has restated a vision in which the US would take over Gaza, after officials in his administration appeared to contradict his earlier comments.
"The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting," Trump said on Thursday. He reiterated that the idea would mean resettling Palestinians, and that no US soldiers would be needed.
Trump's resettlement idea has prompted accusations that he is planning ethnic cleansing, and has drawn condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and Arab leaders. Analysts doubt it will ever happen.
After Trump's first comments on the issue, his officials suggested any relocation would be only temporary.
Under his plan, Trump wrote on Truth Social, Gazans "would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region". The US would then be part of an effort to redevelop the enclave, he said.
His post did not make clear whether the two million residents of the Palestinian territory would be invited to return.
Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations from occupied territory are strictly prohibited.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that any displacement would be temporary. In his own comments, made on the same day, Secretary of State Rubio said the idea was for Gazans to leave the territory for an "interim" period while debris was cleared and reconstruction took place.
These views contradicted Trump's initial comments on the matter. Speaking on Tuesday, when he proposed the development of Gaza into the "Riviera of the Middle East", Trump suggested that the displacement of Palestinians would be permanent.
"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too," he said on Tuesday during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the idea "worth paying attention to".
The announcement took even senior Trump aides by surprise due to a lack of planning around the idea, the New York Times reported, citing four anonymous sources with knowledge of the discussions.
Trump's fresh comment on Thursday that no American soldiers would be needed was more clearly in agreement with Leavitt, who said the US had not committed to putting "boots on the ground".
Speaking soon after at a prayer breakfast, the president reflected briefly on the situation in Gaza, but did not mention his stated plans for the US to "take over" the territory.
After turning his attention to the Middle East, Trump said he hoped "his greatest legacy will be being known as a peacemaker and a unifier".
Fifteen months of fighting have left the Gaza Strip, a territory 41km (25 miles) long and 10km (6 miles) wide, largely uninhabitable.
Entire districts have been razed to the ground. Agricultural land where greenhouses once stood has been reduced to sand and rubble.
The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned that it could take 21 years to remove and dispose of all debris.
It described the water and sanitation systems as "almost entirely defunct", warned of mounting rubbish around camps and shelters, and highlighted the risk that chemicals from destroyed solar panels and the munitions being used could contaminate soil and water supplies.
More than 50 million tonnes of debris have accumulated as a result of the destruction, according to the UN body.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 47,550 people have been killed and 111,600 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Headline: Mosul's landmarks rise again after IS destruction
Author: Sebastian Usher, BBC's Middle East analyst
Published Date: 2025-02-06T15:43:56.633Z
Text: Historic buildings in Mosul, including churches and mosques, are being reopened following years of devastation resulting from the Iraqi city's takeover by the extremist Islamic State (IS) group.
The project, organised and funded by Unesco, began a year after IS was defeated and driven out of the city, in northern Iraq, in 2017.
Unesco's director-general Audrey Azoulay attended a ceremony on Wednesday to mark the reopening.
Local artisans, residents and representatives of all of Mosul's religious communities were also there.
In 2014, IS occupied Mosul, which for centuries was seen as a symbol of tolerance and co-existence between different religious and ethnic communities in Iraq.
The group imposed its extreme ideology on the city, targeting minorities and killing opponents.
Three years later, a US-backed coalition in alliance with the Iraqi army and state-linked militias mounted an intense ground and air offensive to wrest the city back from IS control. The bloodiest battles focused on the Old City, where the group's fighters made a last stand.
Mosul photographer Ali al-Baroodi recalls the horror that greeted him when he first entered the area shortly after the street-by-street battle was over in the summer of 2017.
He saw the gloriously skewed al-Hadba minaret, known as the "hunchback", which had been emblematic of Mosul for hundreds of years, in ruins.
"It was like a ghost town," he says. "Dead bodies all around, a sickening smell and horrible scenes of the city and the skyline without the Hadba minaret.
"It was not the city that we knew - it was like a metamorphosis - that we never imagined not even in our worst nightmares. I fell silent after that for a couple of days. I lost my voice. I lost my mind."
Eighty per cent of the Old City of Mosul, on the west bank of the Tigris, was destroyed during IS's three-year occupation.
It was not just the churches, mosques and old houses that needed to be repaired, but also the community spirit of those who had lived there for so long in relative harmony between religions and ethnicities.
The huge task of rebuilding began under the auspices of Unesco with a budget of $115m (£93m) that the agency had managed to drum up, much of it from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union.
Father Olivier Poquillon - a Dominican priest - returned to Mosul to help oversee the restoration of one of the key buildings, the convent of Notre-Dame de l'Heure, known locally as al-Saa'a, which was founded nearly 200 years ago.
"We started by trying first to gather the team - a team composed of people from Old Mosul from different denominations - Christians, Muslims working all together," he says.
Father Poquillon says that bringing the communities together was the biggest challenge and the biggest achievement.
"If you want to rebuild the buildings you've got first to rebuild trust - if you don't rebuild trust, it's useless to reconstruct the walls of those buildings because they will become a target for other communities."
In charge of the entire project - which included the restoration of 124 old houses and two especially fine mansions - has been the chief architect Maria Rita Acetoso, who came to Mosul straight from restoration work for Unesco in Afghanistan.
"This project demonstrates that culture too can create jobs, can encourage skills development and in addition can make those involved feel part of something meaningful," she says.
She hopes the reconstruction can restore hope and enable the recovery of people's cultural identity and memory.
"I think this is particularly important for the young generations growing up in a situation of conflict and political instability," she adds.
Unesco says that more than 1,300 local young people have been trained up in traditional skills, while some 6,000 new jobs have been created.
More than 100 classrooms were renovated in Mosul. Thousands of historical fragments were recovered and catalogued from the rubble.
Among the host of engineers involved in the rebuilding, 30% were women.
Eight years on, the bells are ringing out again across Mosul from al-Tahera Church, whose roof collapsed after serious damage under IS occupation in 2017.
Other major landmarks of Mosul have also been restored - that wriggling minaret of al-Hadba, the Dominican al-Saa'a Convent and the complex of Al-Nouri mosque.
And people have been able to return to the houses that have been home to their families for centuries.
One resident, Mustafa, said: "My house was built in 1864 - unfortunately it was partly destroyed during the liberation of Mosul and it was unsuitable to live there, especially with my children.
"So I decided to move to my parents' house. I was very pleased and excited to see my house rebuilt again."
Abdullah's family has also lived in a house in the Old City since the 19th Century when the area was a centre for the wool trade - which is why he says their home is so precious to them.
"After Unesco rebuilt my house, I came back," he says. "I can't describe the feeling I had because after seeing all the destruction that happened there, I thought I would never be able to come back and live there again."
The scars of what the people of Mosul endured are yet to heal - just as much of Iraq remains in a fragile state.
But the Old City's rebirth from the rubble represents hope for a better future - as Ali al-Baroodi continues to document the evolution of his beloved home day by day.
"It's truly like seeing a dead person coming back to life in a very, very beautiful way - that is the true spirit of the city coming back to life," he says.

Headline: Israel minister tells army to plan for Palestinians leaving Gaza
Author: David Gritten, BBC News
Published Date: 2025-02-06T13:55:31.208Z
Text: Israel's defence minister has told its military to prepare a plan to "allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so", in line with President Donald Trump's proposal for the US to take over the territory and resettle its 2.1 million Palestinians elsewhere.
Israel Katz said Gazans should have "freedom of movement and migration" and countries critical of Israel's war with Hamas were "obligated" to take them in. Israel controls the movement of people into and out of Gaza.
Trump meanwhile said Gaza would be "turned over" to the US by Israel "at the conclusion of fighting".
But the Palestinian presidency reiterated its rejection of the plan, which it has said would violate international law, and insisted that "Palestine... is not for sale".
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
More than 47,550 people have been killed and 111,600 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times and almost 70% of its buildings are estimated to be destroyed or damaged.
Healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.
The Israeli defence minister wrote on X on Thursday that he welcomed the US president's "bold initiative", saying it could "support long-term reconstruction efforts in a demilitarized, threat-free Gaza after Hamas".
Katz announced that he had instructed the Israeli military to "prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so, to any country willing to receive them".
"The plan will include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air," he said.
"Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse."
He alleged that Hamas was preventing people leaving Gaza and said that they should have "the right to freedom of movement and migration".
Hamas official Basem Naim accused Katz of trying to cover up for "a state that has failed to achieve any of its objectives in the war on Gaza" and said Palestinians would refuse to leave.
Meanwhile, the spokesman for the Palestinian presidency asserted that "Palestine, with its land, history and holy sites, is not for sale".
Nabil Abu Rudeineh also said the Palestinians would "will not give up an inch of their land", whether in Gaza or the occupied West Bank.
"The Palestinian people and their leadership will not allow the repetition of the catastrophes of 1948 and 1967, and will thwart any plan aimed at liquidating their just cause through investment projects whose place is neither in Palestine nor on its land."
The 1948 "Nakba", which means "catastrophe" in Arabic, saw hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flee or driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel.
Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the West Bank, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war along with Gaza, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN.
Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods. The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.
Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza, citing security reasons, after Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.
On Wednesday, Jordan's king expressed its "rejection of any attempts to annex land or displace Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank", while Egypt's foreign minister stressed the importance of reconstruction "without the Palestinians leaving the Gaza Strip".
Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries - said Trump's plan was "absurd" and would "only put oil on the fire" in the region.
The UN human rights office warned that any forcible transfer in, or deportation of, people from occupied territory was strictly prohibited under international law.
The UN's secretary general also said it was "essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing" and stressed that Gaza would be an integral part of a future Palestinian state.
Antonio Guterres told a meeting in New York that the world had "seen a chilling, systematic dehumanisation and demonization of an entire people".
Trump unveiled his plan for the US to take "long-term ownership" of Gaza and oversee its reconstruction during a visit to the White House by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.
The president said most of the Palestinians living in Gaza would have to be relocated to achieve his vision of creating "the Riviera of the Middle East", and that they would be housed in Jordan, Egypt and other countries.
"I hope we can do something where they wouldn't want to go back," he said, echoing earlier remarks in the Oval Office where he talked about resettling people "permanently".
At the White House briefing on Wednesday, spokeswoman Caroline Leavitt was asked to confirm whether all Palestinians who wanted to stay in Gaza would be allowed to do so.
"I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because... it is a demolition site," she replied, appearing to contradict the president.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said the idea was for Gazans to leave the territory for an "interim" period while debris was cleared and reconstruction took place.
On Thursday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Gaza would "be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting".
A ceasefire in effect between Israel and Hamas has halted the war and aims to lead to a permanent end to the fighting.
"The Palestinians... would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free," he added.
The president also said no US soldiers would be needed to maintain stability.
In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Israel's prime minister called Trump's proposal "remarkable" and something that should be "examined, pursued and done".
Netanyahu also suggested that Gazans would be able to return, saying: "They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back, but you have to rebuild Gaza."

Headline: Jeremy Bowen: Trump's Gaza plan won't happen, but it will have consequences

Text: Donald Trump's plan for the US to "take over" and "own" Gaza, resettling its population in the process, is not going to happen. It requires the co-operation of Arab states that have rejected it.
They include Jordan and Egypt - countries that Trump wants to take in Gaza's Palestinians - and Saudi Arabia, which might be expected to foot the bill.
Western allies of the US and Israel are also against the idea.
Some - perhaps many - Palestinians in Gaza might be tempted to get out if they had the chance.
But even if a million left, as many as 1.2m others would still be there.
Presumably the United States - the new owners of Trump's "Riviera of the Middle East" - would have to use force to remove them.
After America's catastrophic intervention in Iraq in 2003, that would be deeply unpopular in the US.
It would be the final end of any lingering hope that a two-state solution was possible. That is the aspiration that a conflict more than a century old could be ended with the establishment of an independent Palestine alongside Israel.
The Netanyahu government is adamantly against the idea, and over years of failed peace talks, "two states for two peoples" became an empty slogan.
But it has been a central plank of US foreign policy since the early 1990s.
The Trump plan would also violate international law.
America's already threadbare assertions that it believes in a rules-based international order would dissolve. Russia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine and China's in Taiwan would be turbocharged.
Why worry about all that if it is not about to happen - at least not in the way Trump announced in Washington, watched by a grinning and clearly delighted Benjamin Netanyahu?
The answer is that Trump's remarks, however outlandish, will have consequences.
He is the president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world - no longer a reality TV host and political hopeful trying to grab headlines.
Short-term, the disruption caused by his stunning announcement could weaken the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. One senior Arab source told me it could be its "death knell".
The absence of a plan for Gaza's future governance is already a fault line in the agreement.
Now Trump has provided one, and even if it does not come to pass, it presses very big buttons in the minds of Palestinians and Israelis.
It will nourish the plans and dreams of ultra-nationalist Jewish extremists who believe all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river, and perhaps beyond, is a God-given Jewish possession.
Their leaders are part of Netanyahu's government and keep him in power - and they're delighted. They want the Gaza war to resume with the longer-term objective of removing the Palestinians and replacing them with Jews.
The finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said Trump had provided the answer to Gaza's future after the 7 October attacks.
His statement said that "whoever committed the most terrible massacre on our land will find himself losing his land forever. Now we will act to finally bury, with God's help, the dangerous idea of a Palestinian state."
Centrist opposition leaders in Israel have been less effusive, perhaps fearing trouble ahead, but have offered a polite welcome to the plan.
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups may feel the need to answer Trump with some kind of show of force against Israel.
For Palestinians, the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call al-Nakba, "the catastrophe". That was the exodus of Palestinians as Israel won its war for independence in 1948.
More than 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes by Israeli forces. All but a handful were never allowed back and Israel passed laws it still uses to confiscate their property.
Now the fear will be that it is happening again.
Many Palestinians already believed Israel was using the war against Hamas to destroy Gaza and expel the population.
It is part of their accusation that Israel is committing genocide – and now they might believe Donald Trump is adding his weight to Israel's plans.
Just because Trump says something, that does not make it true or certain.
His statements are often more like opening gambits in a real estate negotiation than expressions of the settled policy of the United States.
Perhaps Trump is spreading some confusion while he works on another plan. He is said to crave the Nobel peace prize.
Middle East peacemakers, even when they do not ultimately succeed, have a strong track record of winning it.
As the world was digesting his Gaza announcement, he posted on his Truth Social platform his desire for a "verified nuclear peace agreement" with Iran.
The Iranian regime denies it wants nuclear weapons but there has been an open debate in Tehran about whether they are now so threatened that they need the ultimate deterrent.
For many years Netanyahu has wanted the US, with Israeli help, to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. Doing a deal with Iran was never part of his plan.
During Trump's first term, Netanyahu waged a long and successful campaign to persuade him to pull the US out of the nuclear deal Barack Obama's administration signed with Iran.
If Trump wanted to throw the Israeli hard-right something to keep them happy as he makes overtures to the Iranians, he has succeeded.
But he has also created uncertainty and injected more instability into the world's most turbulent region.

Headline: 'We won't go out of Gaza': Palestinians express shock and defiance at Trump plan
Author: Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent, Reporting fromJerusalem, Rushdi Abualouf, Gaza correspondent, Reporting fromCairo

Text: For most Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip there is already a painful history of forced displacement that is at the heart of their response to US President Donald Trump's plan to take over the war-torn territory.
Speaking to the BBC, residents of a tent camp in the central town of Deir al-Balah expressed shock and defiance at the idea of being permanently resettled outside.
"Even if it costs us our souls, we will not leave Gaza," said Mahmoud Bahjat, who is from the north. "We are against Trump's decision. He ended the war but displacing us would end our lives."
On the other hand, many Israelis have been expressing satisfaction at the radical ideas from the White House, particularly those on the far-right who seek to resettle Gaza.
Since a ceasefire took hold in Gaza - on the eve of Trump's inauguration last month - there have been dramatic scenes of Palestinians returning to what is left of their homes.
Families have piled up possessions into cars and donkey carts or walked long distances along the coastal road, often just to reach piles of rubble.
According to the UN, at least 1.9m people, or about 90% of the population, across Gaza became displaced during 15 months of war.
The scenes of Palestinians on the move have echoed black-and-white footage from 1948 and the mass evacuations that took place during fighting before and after the creation of the state of Israel.
More than 700,000 people were then forced from their homes. The majority of Gazans are descendants of those original refugees.
Standing between rows of plastic sheeting in the Deir al-Balah camp, Jamalat Wadi says that her family has now sacrificed enough and that they are determined to build a new home.
"We endured a year and half of war. When [the Israeli military] finally withdraw from here, we want to remove the rubble and live on the land."
"After the US made Israel destroy our houses in Gaza, he is telling us that Gaza is destroyed and we have to leave?" Ms Wadi goes on. "If there is only one drop of blood left in our children, we won't go out of Gaza. We won't give up on it!"
Many Palestinians we spoke to called on Jordan and Egypt - which Trump is pressing to take displaced Gazans - and for Saudi Arabia - which he wants to normalise relations with Israel - to hold out against US pressure.
Since its establishment, Israel has rejected the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their historic homeland, as this would have left the Jewish people as a minority within its borders. Today, there are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN, with most living in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
Israel has long argued that those who were dispossessed should be absorbed by Arab countries, pointing out that thousands of Jews left these to come to Israel during the regional turmoil after it became a state.
Israeli officials suggest that by proposing to take over war-torn Gaza, creating a "Riviera of the Middle East" after resettling Palestinians elsewhere, the Trump administration is offering fresh thinking on a long-running conflict.
While Trump notably did not back the re-establishment of settlements in Gaza, settler leaders have reacted enthusiastically to the idea of displacement, calling on the Israeli government to act immediately.
Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and began constructing settlements in both that are widely seen as illegal under international law. In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, although the UN still regards it as Israeli-occupied territory.
"Assuming Trump's declarations about transferring Gazans to other countries throughout the world actualise, we need to move quickly and build settlements throughout the Gaza Strip," stated the Nachala settlement organisation, which claims it has hundreds of activists ready to move there.
"No part of Israel should be left unsettled by Jews. If we leave any area desolate it is liable to be overtaken by our enemies," Nachala added.
In contrast, the Israeli anti-occupation NGO, Peace Now, dismissed the Trump plan. It backs the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel as part of the long-standing international formula for peace in the region, known as the two-state solution.
Peace Now said there was "no feasible way to transfer two million Gazans" outside.
"It's time to stop fantasising about ethnic cleansing and forced displacement in Gaza and face reality - there is only one solution that can guarantee security and stability in the Middle East: two states for two peoples and an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," it commented.
Many Israelis and Palestinians are concerned about what the latest announcements could mean for the current talks on extending the Gaza ceasefire.
The next stage of the deal is meant to see the return of some 60 remaining Israeli hostages - not all of whom are alive - and a more permanent end to the fighting.
However, the brother of one Israeli hostage held by Hamas told us: "I don't take what Trump says too seriously. It's not realistic. He's shooting for the stars."
He added that this was "like with Canada" - referring to the US leader's suggestions that it should become his country's "51st state".
Some Gazans did acknowledge that they felt one aspect of President Trump's declaration was based on reality - his comments that the small coastal strip has become "unliveable".
Last month, a UN damage assessment showed that clearing over 50m tonnes of rubble left in Gaza as a result of the heavy Israeli bombardment could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2bn.
Bilal al-Rantisi, a former customs worker, is in shock after arriving back in Gaza City with his wife and four children having spent more than a year displaced in the south.
"We have returned to a catastrophe, the worst in history," he said despondently. "I found neither my home nor my siblings' homes were standing. Trump doesn't speak in vain. He knows that Gaza is no longer a place fit for human habitation."
He said he was hoping to sell his car and his wife's gold jewellery to raise funds.
"I will leave Gaza at the earliest possible opportunity. Yes, all Gazans oppose displacement but putting emotions aside, if people were given the chance, many would choose to leave."

Text: Given the political situation in which they live, Palestinians are avid media consumers. Online outlets are the main sources for news consumption, followed by TV and radio.
Political instability and security threats mean journalists work in a high-risk environment. They continue to be subjected to restrictions by the Palestinian Authority (PA), Hamas and Israel.
The media landscape is shaped by the conflict with Israel and the rivalry between the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.
International watchdogs say the media environment is not free.
"In the West Bank, journalists are the victims of press freedom violations by both the PA and the Israeli occupation forces. In the Gaza Strip, they are threatened by both Israeli military offensives and Hamas policies," says Reporters Without Borders

The main TV and radio stations are run by the PA's Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) and Hamas's Al-Aqsa Media Network.There are dozens of private broadcasters. Pan-Arab satellite TVs, especially Qatar's Al-Jazeera, are popular.
The growth of online media has eroded the traditional dominance of outlets run by the PA and Hamas.
Facebook is the most popular social media platform. Accounts and channels affiliated with Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group are regularly blocked by social platforms.

Headline: Trump's Gaza plan will be seen as flying in face of international law

Text: When US President Donald Trump began speaking 10 days ago of Gaza as a demolition site, calling to "clean out that whole thing", it wasn't clear how far these were off-the-cuff remarks.
But in the lead up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit, in his Oval Office comments before the meeting, and in the press conference itself, it's now clear he is profoundly serious about his proposals.
They amount to the most radical upending in the established US position on Israel and the Palestinians in the recent history of the conflict; and will be seen as flying in the face of international law.
As well as how the announcement will be absorbed by ordinary people on the ground, it could also have a significant impact on the more immediate phased ceasefire and hostage release process, at a critical juncture.
Trump and his officials are framing his call to - in his language - permanently "resettle" all Palestinians out of Gaza as a humanitarian gesture, saying there is no alternative for them because Gaza is a "demolition site".
Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations are strictly prohibited, and Palestinians as well as Arab nations will see this as nothing short of a clear proposal aimed at their expulsion and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land.
That's why Arab leaders have already categorically rejected his ideas, made with increasing frequency over the last 10 days, when he suggested Egypt and Jordan could "take" Palestinians from Gaza.
In a statement on Saturday, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League said that such a move could "threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples".
It has long been a desire of the ultranationalist far right in Israel to expel Palestinians from the occupied territories and expand Jewish settlements in their place.
Since the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, these groups – leaders of whom have been part of Netanyahu's coalition – have demanded the war against Hamas continues indefinitely, vowing ultimately to re-establish Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip.
They have continued their calls and opposed the current ceasefire and hostage release deal.
In his White House press conference with the Israeli prime minister, Trump went further even than his recent growing calls for the Palestinians in Gaza to be "relocated" to Egypt and Jordan, saying that the United States would then take the territory over and rebuild it.
When asked whether Palestinians would be allowed back, he said "the world's people" would live there, saying it would be an "international, unbelievable place", before adding "also Palestinians".
His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier in the day summed up much of the tone around the proposal, saying of Trump "this guy knows real estate".
Trump said it would be the "Riviera of the Middle East".
Asked whether American troops would be involved in the take over of Gaza, Mr Trump said "we'll do what is necessary".
His proposals amount to the most radical transformation in the US position on the territory since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the war of 1967, which saw the start of Israel's military occupation of land including the Gaza Strip.
Gaza was already home to Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in the wars surrounding Israel's creation.
They and their descendants make up the vast majority of Gaza's population to this day.
Trump's proposals, if enacted, would involve that population, now more than two million people, being forced elsewhere in the Arab world or even beyond, says Trump, to "resettle… permanently".
The proposals would wipe out the possibility of a future two-state solution in any conventional sense and will be categorically rejected by Palestinians and the Arab world as an expulsion plan.
Much of Netanyahu's political base and the ultranationalist settler movement in Israel will champion President Trump's words, seeing them as the fulfilment of a means as Netanyahu puts it to stop "Gaza being a threat to Israel".
For ordinary Palestinians, it would amount to a mass act of collective punishment.

Headline: Palestinian gunman kills Israeli soldiers as UN warns over W Bank operation

Text: Israel's military says two soldiers have been killed in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank, as its forces continue a major operation against Palestinian armed groups in the north of the territory.
Another eight soldiers were wounded when a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a checkpoint in Tayasir village, 2km (1.2 miles) north of Tubas, a military statement said. The attacker was shot dead, it said.
Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad praised the attack as a response to the Israeli operation in Tubas, Jenin and Tulkarm, but neither said they were behind it.
Meanwhile, a UN official warned the situation in Jenin's refugee camp was heading in a "catastrophic direction".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the start of a large-scale operation to "defeat terrorism" in Jenin on 21 January, three days after the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took effect. The operation was expanded into Tulkarm and Tubas last week.
The Palestinian health ministry says Israeli forces have killed 70 Palestinians across the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, since the start of the year.
The figure includes the 25 reported killed in the Jenin area and 13 in the Tubas and Tulkarm areas over the past two weeks.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it killed about 55 "terrorists" and arrested 380 wanted individuals across the West Bank in January.
Israeli media reported that the Palestinian who carried out Tuesday's shooting attack in Tayasir was able to sneak up to a military post next to the checkpoint before opening fire with an M16 rifle at soldiers stationed there.
Soldiers fired back and a gun battle lasted several minutes before the attacker was killed, they said.
The IDF named the two soldiers who were killed as Sgt Maj Ofer Yung, 39, and Sgt Maj Avraham Friedman, 43.
Two of the eight wounded soldiers were in a serious condition in hospital, it said.
During a visit to the scene later on Tuesday, the IDF's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, promised it would "investigate and draw conclusions" from what he described as the "serious attack".
"We will increase the counterterrorism activity and expand it to additional areas," he added.
Hamas praised what it described as the "heroic and qualitative operation carried out by a Palestinian resistance fighter" in Tayasir, saying that it showed "the crimes of the occupation and its aggression against the northern occupied West Bank will not go unpunished".
On Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman alleged that the Israeli operation was part of a wider effort aimed at "displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing".
Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned of the deteriorating situation at Jenin refugee camp.
Hundreds of Israeli security forces backed by helicopters, drones and armoured bulldozers have been carrying out raids in the camp, long seen as a stronghold of armed groups.
"Large parts of the camp were completely destroyed in a series of detonations by the Israeli forces. It is estimated that 100 houses were destroyed or heavily damaged," Ms Touma said.
"This detonation that happened on Sunday was when children were supposed to go back to school," she added.
The IDF said on Sunday that it had "dismantled" 23 structures where explosives laboratories, weapons, observation posts and other infrastructure belonging to armed groups were located.
Ms Touma also said that Unrwa, which has been unable to provide services in the camp since early December, had received no prior warning of the explosions from Israeli authorities.
On Thursday, two laws passed by Israel's parliament last year which bans Unrwa activity on Israeli soil and forbids contact between Israeli officials and Unrwa employees came into force. Israeli officials accuse Unrwa of being complicit with Hamas - an allegation the agency denies.
Ms Touma said the Israeli government had "not communicated to Unrwa how they intend to implement" the laws, and that Unrwa teams were currently "staying and delivering".
There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel.
Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.

Headline: Car bomb blast in northern Syria kills at least 20

Text: At least 20 people, most of them women, have been killed in a car bomb attack in northern Syria, the country's presidency says.
The Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, said a car filled with explosives blew up on a main road in the southern outskirts of the city of Manbij as a flat-bed lorry carrying about 30 agricultural workers drove past.
The agency had earlier put the death toll at 15, including 11 women and three girls. Another 15 women and girls were wounded, some of them critically.
The presidency vowed to ensure that the perpetrators of what it described as a "terrorist" attack would face the "most severe punishments".
There was no immediate claim from any armed groups for the bombing, which was the deadliest since rebel forces overthrow president Bashar al-Assad in December.
The commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led alliance backed by the US which controls much of north-eastern Syria, condemned the attack as a "criminal act" that threatened the "unity of the national fabric".
Earlier, his media chief alleged that such bombings were among the "fundamental tactics" used by Turkish-backed factions known as the Syrian National Army (SNA), which the SDF has been battling in the Manbij area over the past two months.
The SNA did not comment on the allegation. However, the Turkey-based Syrian Islamic Council accused the SDF of being behind the blast.
Monday's car bombing was the second such attack in the Manbij area in only three days.
On Saturday, two children and a woman were among four people killed by an explosion on a street in the city centre, the Syria Civil Defence said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that the blast was near an SNA military position and that nine people were killed, including several pro-Turkish fighters.
As the Assad regime collapsed the SNA launched an offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates which the SDF had held since driving out the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in 2016.
The SNA took control of Manbij on 9 December, after fighters from the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council withdrew. But since then, the SDF has tried to retake the territory by launching a counter-offensive.
Turkey wants to push the SDF away from its border because it views the Kurdish militia that dominates the alliance, the People's Protection Units (YPG), as a terrorist organisation. It says the YPG is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades.
The car bombing came amid talks between Syria's transitional government and the SDF on the militia alliance's future.
The commander of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, met President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus last week, and told the Associated Press news agency on Sunday that the two sides were negotiating with the help of Western mediators.
"Our vision of Syria is a decentralized, secular and civil country based on democracy that preserves the rights of all of its components," he said, referring to the country's many religious and ethnic groups.
When asked whether he was prepared to dissolve the SDF, Abdi said that in principle it wanted to be part of Syria's defence ministry and part of the country's defence strategy, but that the details still had to be discussed, according to AP.
Sharaa, whose Islamist group led the rebel offensive which ended Assad's 24-year rule, told Turkish TV last month that he wanted Syrian Kurdish groups to disarm.
"Preventing bloodshed and treating everyone equally is our top priority. Therefore, we believe all weapons must be under state control," he said.

Headline: Who are the Israeli and Thai hostages just released by Hamas?

Text: Three Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals held by Hamas in Gaza since the 7 October 2023 have been released.
Agam Berger, a 20-year-old Israeli soldier, was reunited with her family at a military base in southern Israel after being handed over by armed Palestinian fighters to the Red Cross in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Thursday.
About two hours later there was another handover in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, were pictured being escorted by fighters into a Red Cross vehicle.
The Israeli military subsequently announced that they had been transferred to its forces in Gaza along with five Thai hostages and then moved to Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office named the Thai nationals as agricultural workers Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao.
Under a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, 110 Palestinians are also being released from Israeli jails in exchange for the Israeli hostages on Thursday.
The release of the Thai nationals was not part of the agreement, which began on 19 January.
It should see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed in return for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza in Israeli jails during the first phase lasting six weeks.
So far, 10 of those Israeli hostages - five civilians, including four women, and five female soldiers - have been freed.
About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.
This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says.
Yarden Bibas, 34, was taken hostage from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz.
His family said in a statement issued after his release that he "left his safe room to protect his family, bravely survived captivity, and returned to an unbearable reality".
His wife, Shiri, 32, and two sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were four and nine-months-old on 7 October 2023, were also captured, but they have not been released.
"A quarter of our heart has returned to us after 15 long months," the Bibas family said. "There are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice. Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete."
American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, is a husband, father and grandfather. Originally from North Carolina, Mr Siegel moved to Israel four decades ago.
On 7 October 2023, Hamas attackers broke into Keith and his wife Aviva's home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza and dragged them away, breaking Keith's ribs and shooting him in the hand, she told the BBC.
She was released from captivity in a week-long ceasefire in November 2023.
After Keith's release, his family said in a statement: "Finally, after 484 long, terrifying days and nights, full of immense worry for our father, we can breathe again."
French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, is a father of four. He was taken hostage from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz along with two of his children, who were released in November 2023.
"Ofer is home!" his family said in a statement. "We are overwhelmed with joy, relief, and emotion after 484 long and difficult days of unbearable waiting. Today, we finally embrace Ofer, seeing and truly comprehending that he is here with us."
"We have witnessed how, through extraordinary mental strength, he survived this hell. Ofer endured months in a nightmare, and we are proud of his ability to survive and hold onto the hope of embracing his children again."
"A challenging rehabilitation period lies ahead, but we know that with our combined strength, abundant love, and a united, supportive family, we will do everything necessary to help him stand on his feet again."
Arbel Yehud, 29, was taken from her home in Nir Oz in southern Israel during the 7 October attacks.
She was abducted along with her partner, Ariel Cunio. He and his brother, David Cunio, remain in captivity according to The Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Arbel's brother, Dolev Yehud, was initially believed to have been taken hostage, but was later declared dead by Israeli authorities after his remains were identified.
Arbel worked at the Center for Technology, Science and Space at the Eshkol Regional Council.
Following her release, Arbel's family said in a statement that they were "overwhelmed with emotion".
"Ahead of us lies another journey of family rehabilitation. We are a bereaved family, still aching and missing our Dolev," they added.
They also noted that their "mission is not yet complete", with Ariel and David still held captive. "We will not rest until all hostages are released," they said.
Gadi Moses, aged 80, was also abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz where he worked as an agricultural expert.
His partner, Efrat Katz, was killed in the attack.
In September, his family told the Times of Israel that they had not heard any information about him since December 2023, when he appeared in a Hamas propaganda video.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said he was a founding member of his kibbutz's vineyard, and helped look after its community vegetable garden.
After being reunited with his children Yair, Moran, and Oded on Thursday, Gadi was quoted as saying: "I will do as much as I can to restore Nir Oz."
Soldier Agam Berger, 20, was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military base on the border with Gaza. She was seen being taken away in videos released by Hamas.
According to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, she was serving as an observer at the base, having arrived just two days before the 7 October attack.
Pongsak, who is from Buriram province in north-eastern Thailand, was 35 years old and had been working in agriculture in Israel for more than six years when Hamas-led gunmen attacked the kibbutz where he worked, according to his father.
Before he was taken hostage, Pongsak posted a live video on Facebook in which gunshots and explosions could be heard.
Three days later, Pongsak's colleagues informed his father that he had been abducted with two others.
His older brother was also working in Israel 15 months ago, but he was safe in the north of the country.
Pongsak's father, Wilas, wept after receiving a call to say he had been released on Thursday.
"I never thought this day would come, everything has been too quiet for a while," he told the BBC.
Sathian, from the north-eastern Thai province of Nong Bua Lamphu, was 34 when he was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.
His mother said he been a monk for several years after going to primary school, and that he had been working in Israel for four years before the Hamas attack.
She was not sure whether Sathian had been killed or taken hostage until some of his friends who had been kidnapped from the same kibbutz were freed and returned to Thailand.
Following Sathian's release, his younger sister Sirinna revealed that the family had never lost hope.
"We always believed that my brother was still alive. We never gave up. We always waited for him to come home," she said.
Watchara is a 33-year-old father of one from Udon Thani province in north-east Thailand.
Last February, Watchara's parents told BBC News Thai that he and his younger brother had been working in Israel's agricultural sector for three years before the 7 October attacks to help pay off the family's debts. As with Pongsak Thaenna, one of the brothers was based in the south and the other in the north.
Watchara was working at Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas-led gunmen stormed across the nearby Gaza perimeter fence.
His family spent a month fearing that he had been killed before they were informed by multiple sources that his name was on a list of hostages.
"The first thing I want to do is to hug my son and tell him I miss him very much," Watchara's mother, Wiwwaew, said on Thursday following his release. "His daughter, Nudee, was also happy. She has been praying every day for her daddy to return."
Bannawat, from the northern Thai province of Nan, was 27 when he was kidnapped during the 7 October attack.
His wife, Wichayada, said he had gone to Israel to work for nine months and taken out loans worth more than 100,000 baht ($2,970; £2,380) to pay for the travel.
The youngest of their two children was only one month old when he was taken back to Gaza as a hostage.
Surasak Lamnao, 32, is from Udon Thani province in north-eastern Thailand.
As with Sathian Suwannakham, Surasak's mother only received confirmation that he was a hostage when a released Thai hostage told her that he was being held in captivity.
Agam was taken captive alongside her fellow observers Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy.
The other four Israeli soldiers were released by Hamas on 25 January, in a swap that saw Israel free 200 Palestinian prisoners.
They were handed to the Red Cross in Gaza City in the second such exchange since the ceasefire came into effect.
The first release saw three women hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners freed on 19 January.
Karina Ariev, 20, was serving at the Nahal Oz army base when she was kidnapped on 7 October, 2023.
Her sister Alexandra told the BBC she heard shooting as Karina called her during the attack, and later saw a video showing Karina being taken away in a vehicle.
Alexandra then saw the video circulating on Telegram of Karina's kidnapping. "We identified her, she had blood on her face, she was screaming.
"I would never wish anyone to feel this feeling," she told the BBC. "Time has stopped."
After her release, her family described her as a "symbol of courage, heart, and determination, and we are proud of her beyond words".
"After 477 tumultuous days of pain, worry, and endless anxiety – we finally got to embrace our beloved Karina, hear her voice, and see her smile that once again fills us with light," the statement read.
Naama Levy, 20, was filmed being bundled into a jeep, her hands tied behind her back. The footage was released by Hamas and circulated widely on social media. According to her mother, the teenager had just begun her military service.
But she had previously been part of an Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative, and her family called her "a peace seeker".
In a video of her kidnapping from the Nahal Oz army base, she was heard to tell her captors in English: "I have friends in Palestine."
In May 2024 her brother, Amit, said her family released the footage to "encourage all sides to get back to the table" to solve "an unbearable humanitarian issue".
"We feel like she's handling the situation like the true superhero she is, like a hero fighting for her life."
Daniella Gilboa, 20, was injured in the leg when she was kidnapped along with other female soldiers at Nahal Oz.
She has been seen in several videos, and in one last year asked Israel's government why she had been "abandoned" and "discarded" while war raged around her.
Ms Gilboa's mother, Orly, told the Jerusalem Post the video showed her daughter was "strong and determined". However, she said she was concerned about her "poor mental state".
After her release, her family said she had "survived 477 days in the hell of Gaza and has finally returned to our family's embrace".
"How we've prayed for this moment!" the statement said.
The family went on to thank Israelis for their "prayers and support during this time", adding "we couldn't have made it through without you".
Liri Albag was 18 and had just started military training as an Army lookout when Hamas attacked the Nahal Oz base on 7 October 2023.
Her cousin Aya Albag, a corporal in the army, said she had told her she was "proud" of her passing her observation course before she went to the base
"She was motivated and so happy that she was assigned to Nahal Oz," she told the Jerusalem Post. "She began her role on Thursday, and a day and a half later, on Saturday morning, she was kidnapped."
Her family say that she has managed to pass messages back to them through released hostages.
In January 2024, footage of Albag was released by Hamas and she could be heard saying her "entire life had been put on pause".
"The world is starting to forget about us. No one cares about us. We're living in a nightmare."
The hostages freed on 19 January - the first under this latest ceasefire deal - were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari.
All three arrived back in Israel this month after being released by Hamas in Gaza, and were reunited with their families.
Romi Gonen, 24, was captured as she tried to escape the Nova music festival when it was targeted by the militant group as part of the 7 October 2023 attack.
More than 360 people were killed at the festival when Hamas fighters crossed over the border, 2km (1.3 miles) to the west. The desert landscape offered partygoers limited cover and exit routes were blocked by gunmen.
When sirens sounded as the attack unfolded, Romi called her family. Her mother, Meirav, recalled hearing shots and shouting in Arabic in the final call with her daughter.
Romi was ambushed by Hamas militants as she tried to flee.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Romi had gone to the festival "to do what she loved, to dance" - something she had studied for 12 years, starring in solo performances and becoming an "amazing choreographer".
In a video clip shared by the Israeli military, Romi's father was seen jumping in the air before breaking down in tears as he watched footage of his daughter's release.
Doron, 31, was abducted from her apartment in Kibbutz Kfar Aza - near Gaza's north-western border - when Hamas attacked.
The community, one of many Israeli villages along the border, was heavily targeted by armed militants during the 7 October attacks.
Israeli officials said Hamas burned homes and killed civilians, including whole families, as well as taking hostages.
When the assault began, Doron contacted her family and friends via WhatsApp to say she was hiding under the bed as militants advanced, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.
In her last voice message, she was heard screaming "they've caught me" as shouting and gunfire sounded in the background.
Doron's family received no information about her whereabouts for nearly four months.
"After an unbearable 471 days, our beloved Dodo has finally returned to our arms," her family said in a statement released by the missing families forum.
Emily, 28, was shot in the hand and taken into Gaza from her home during the attack, and also saw her dog shot and killed. Photographs after her release showed Emily with a bandaged hand and two missing fingers from that attack.
Her mother, Mandy Damari, was also in the kibbutz in her separate home on 7 October. Mrs Damari hid in the safe room and was saved by a bullet hitting the door handle, making it impossible for attackers to get in.
As the assault unfolded, Emily sent her mother a text message containing a single heart emoji - that was the last contact they had.
Emotional images showed Emily reunited with her mother in Israel, hugging while on a video call with her brother.
"I want to thank everyone who never stopped fighting for Emily throughout this horrendous ordeal, and who never stopped saying her name," Mrs Damari said.
Mrs Damari was born and raised in the UK, and met her husband on a holiday in Israel aged 20.
Emily, the youngest of four children, has strong connections with the UK - she is a Tottenham Hotspur fan and would often visit to see relatives.
Before the ceasefire, Israel said 94 hostages remained unaccounted for, but it believed only 60 to still be alive.
There are 26 more Israeli hostages due to be handed over in the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Israel has said eight of them are dead, citing a list provided by Hamas that gave information on the status of the hostages.

Headline: 'I don't know how he survived', says freed Israeli hostage's niece

Text: While held hostage by Hamas for 15 months in Gaza, 80-year-old Gadi Moses ate mainly a piece of bread and an olive twice a day, his niece Efrat Machikawa says.
"I have no idea how he survived," she tells the BBC. "He lost so much weight."
He was given a small bowl of water to wash himself every five days and had to ask to use the toilet, she said. He moved frequently and was mostly alone, with Ms Machikawa saying "loneliness is another form of torture".
He calculated maths problems in his head to distract himself, and walked up to 11 km (six miles) a day in a room, measuring the distance, she added.
"Even in the darkest times, he knew how to somehow lift himself," she said. "The hope of reuniting with the family and worrying about us was the greatest power, was the only nutrition that he had for his soul."
Gadi was one of 18 hostages released so far this year as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, in exchange for 583 Palestinian prisoners.
The ceasefire aims to end 15 months of war in Gaza, after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 as hostages.
Israel's military campaign in response killed more than 47,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN.
Now, as hostages return from more than a year in captivity, details of their conditions are emerging. Accounts of limited food, with no fresh vegetables, are similar to conditions reported by Gazans during the war.
Two former hostages' family members told the BBC they came back thinner.
"We're all very, very excited to have Keith back home, but very worried to see the state that he came back to us in," Tal Wax, the niece of 65-year-old American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who was released on Saturday, said.
"Although we can see that he is able to walk and talk we see that he has lost a lot of weight," she said.
She heard from her cousins and Mr Siegel's wife Aviva that "he had to endure a lot of horrible situations in captivity while still remaining the good person he is."
He is still a vegan, she added.
"Keith is very humane and he wanted to tell us he's still the same person... even after all that he's been through... He's still living up to his convictions," she said.
"This is just the start of his rehabilitation. We have a long way ahead of us."
Ms Machikawa said even her uncle's release was a "terrifying" experience.
As crowds surrounded him in Gaza on Thursday, he thought it was the "end of his life", she said.
After he was back in Israel, she was able to sleep for five hours for the first time since his capture.
"I feel like my tension is slowly melting," she said.
On Friday, she ran to embrace her uncle in the hospital, where he gave her "the strongest, most powerful hug", and she let out a "burst of tears of relief and love".
"We understand that the uncle we know is the same one we know but even greater," she said, as he was talking about rehabilitation and being strong, and dreaming of returning to his fields, where he is an agricultural expert.
"Unity and family and devoting yourself for justice and a right cause are greater than anything, because I stopped my life on 7 October," she said.
She thanked Qatar and the US for mediating the deal, and "brave" Red Cross workers who facilitated the releases.
"The joy is amazing", she said, but she has mixed feelings until every hostage is back. She said "we must eradicate terror" and "Israel has to secure its borders and work for a better neighbourhood and region".
"We shall always strive to be better, to be like Gadi, to be the one that connects even in the worst times and gives the hand for the chance of better lives with everyone around us."
Few hostages freed so far this year have spoken publicly about their experiences.
On Saturday, Doron Steinbrecher, who was freed two weeks ago, released a video statement.
"It will take time and it's a process - it won't end in a week or two, but I'm here thanks to you, and I'm okay," she said.
"I understand that everyone knows me from that terrible recording "They caught me, they caught me, they caught me" or as the blonde girl wearing pink", she said. "But I'm no longer blonde, and I won't wear pink anymore. I'm Doron, 31 years old. I'm no longer Hamas's captive, and I'm home."
To families with loved ones still in captivity, "you are not alone" and "we continue to fight for you", she added.
That includes the Bibas family, who welcomed back Yarden on Saturday, but not his wife, Shiri, and two small sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were also taken hostage.
Hamas had previously said they were killed in an Israeli air strike early on in the war - but they were named in a list of hostages it said in January it was willing to free.
"A quarter of our heart has returned to us after 15 long months," the Bibas family said in statement. "Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete."
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said his country remained "deeply concerned" about their fate.
Another 15 hostages and around 1,300 Palestinian prisoners are still due to be released in the first six weeks of the ceasefire, which started on 19 January.

Headline: Sharaa vows to pursue criminals as Syria's transitional president

Text: Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to "pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes" in his first address to the nation since the fall of ousted leader Bashar al-Assad.
Sharaa has been named president for a "transitional period", seven weeks after he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad.
He committed to issuing a "constitutional declaration" to serve as a "legal reference" during the country's transition, following the suspension of the old constitution.
On Wednesday, rebel military commander Hassan Abdul Ghani announced the cancellation of Syria's 2012 constitution and the dissolution of the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies, according to the Sana news agency.
Sharaa began the pre-recorded speech on Thursday by saying that he would be addressing his words to all Syrian men and women, including refugees, the families of "martyrs" and missing people, and activists who have dedicated their lives to the struggle for a free Syria.
He credited his coming to power to every Syrian who took part in the uprising and tried to make a change, and vowed to "pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes".
He also promised to hold a "national dialogue conference" and vowed to preserve "civil peace" and Syria's territorial unity.
It comes after announcements were made on Wednesday during an event in Damascus attended by the commanders of factions who fought alongside the rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It was entitled the "Conference for Announcing the Victory of the Syrian Revolution".
All rebel groups which opposed Assad in the 13-year civil war would be dissolved and integrated into state institutions, Sharaa said.
As president, Sharaa would form an interim legislative council to help govern until a new constitution was approved, Ghani said.
In late December, Sharaa told Al Arabiya TV in an interview that it would take up to four years to hold new elections.
He said an up-to-date census would be required first which "would take time" and that writing up a new constitution would also take up to three years to complete.
Sharaa also reiterated in the interview that he planned a "national dialogue conference", which he said would "bring together all components" of Syrian society.
In 2011, Assad brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.
HTS - a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK - previously dominated the last rebel stronghold in north-western Syria.
On 8 December, as the rebels entered Damascus after routing the army and sweeping down from the north in the space of only 12 days, Assad resigned the presidency and fled to Russia.
An interim government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, the former head of the rebel administration in the north-west, has been tasked with running the country until March.
Also on Wednesday, the Syrian government called on Russia to address "past mistakes" by paying war reparations, during the first visit by a top Kremlin delegation since the fall of Assad, its staunch ally.
Sharaa and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov discussed "rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as compensation, reconstruction and recovery", Sana reported.
The Russian foreign ministry said its delegation expressed "unwavering support" for Syria's unity and readiness to assist its recovery from the civil war.
The Russian military carried out tens of thousands of air strikes on rebel-held areas after intervening in the conflict in support of Assad in 2015. A UK-based monitoring group says more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, were killed by those strikes and other Russian operations.
Since the fall of the Assad regime, Russia has been withdrawing troops and weapons from its two bases on Syria's Mediterranean coast - Hmeimim airbase near Latakia and the naval base in Tartous.
Recent satellite photos analysed by BBC Verify showed that two Russian warships were docked at Tartous, which experts said suggested an evacuation of the facility had begun.
However, Russia is believed to be seeking to retain both bases, which give it a strategically important foothold in the eastern Mediterranean.
Following the Russian delegation's visit to Damascus, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow: "That was an important trip, and the contacts were important, too, because it is necessary to establish and maintain a constant dialogue with Syria."
When asked about reports that the Syrian government had requested Assad's extradition and war reparations in return, he replied: "I leave this without any comments. We will continue further dialogue with the Syrian authorities."
In the interview with Al Arabiya, Sharaa noted the "deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria" and said he did not want Russia to leave "in a way that undermines its relationship with our country".
"All of Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts," he added.

Headline: British-Israeli hostage says Hamas held her at UN facilities

Text: A British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 15 months says she was detained for some time at United Nations facilities.
During a phone call with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Damari - who was released earlier this month - said she was held at sites belonging to the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa).
She also said she was denied medical treatment during her captivity, despite being shot in the hand and leg.
In a statement, Unrwa said claims that hostages had been held on UN premises were "very serious" and that it had repeatedly called for independent investigations into claims Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, were misusing the facilities.
Israel has repeatedly accused personnel from Unrwa of being involved in the 7 October attacks and said that its buildings in Gaza were used by Hamas. The Israeli government plans to ban the organisation from operating.
During the call with Downing Street, Ms Damari said that while being held at an Unrwa facility, her captors only provided her with an out-of-date bottle of iodine to treat gunshot wounds in her leg and her left hand, on which she lost two fingers.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Unrwa's director of communications Juliette Touma was asked about Ms Damari's claims. She said: "For many, many months we did not have access to several of our facilities.
"So the vast majority of our buildings were turned into shelters when the war started.
"At some point we had a million people in those shelters."
A Downing Street spokesperson said they "welcome the fact that Unrwa have said there should be an investigation into the use of their facilities".
Ms Damari, now 28, also used the call with Sir Keir to thank people in the UK who campaigned for her release.
A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas will see the gradual release of hostages being held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons.
Three more hostages are set to be released on Saturday, while 183 Palestinian prisoners are expected to be freed.
Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people.
The attack triggered a war which has devastated Gaza. Israel's 15-month military offensive killed 47,460 Palestinians in the territory, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

Addressing the commanders wearing military uniform, Sharaa stressed that Syria's new leadership faced a "heavy task and a great responsibility".
He said the first priority was to "fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way". Secondly, he added, civil peace should be maintained by "seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks".
He also called for state institutions, particularly the military, security agencies and police, and economic infrastructure to be rebuilt.
In late December, Sharaa told Al Arabiya TV in an interview that it would take up to four years to hold new elections.
