# ðŸ§  Part 3 â€” Advanced Model

This part focuses on developing a more *advanced fake news classification model* to improve upon the baseline Logistic Regression built in Part 2.

---

## ðŸ§© Overview
The objective here is to experiment with *more powerful algorithms* and *richer text features* to boost model accuracy and robustness.  
This step moves beyond simple models toward modern NLP-based classification.

## âš™ How to Run
Before executing this notebook:
- Complete *Part 1* to generate cleaned_file.csv.
- Ensure that cleaned_file.csv is in the same directory as AdvancedPart3_final.ipynb.

Then, open the notebook and run cells in order or simply use *Run All*.

```bash
AdvancedPart3_final.ipynb

ðŸ§  Model Development

In this part, you will create a more complex fake news predictor.
You can explore one or more of the following algorithms:

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)


2. Naive Bayes Classifier


3. Neural Network



For text representations, consider:

TF-IDF vectorization

Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.)

n-gram features for richer language understanding

ðŸ“Š Evaluation & Reporting

Ensure full reproducibility and transparency by including:

All chosen model parameters and how they were selected

Clear justification for your modeling decisions

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
