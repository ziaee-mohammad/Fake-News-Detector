# ðŸ§© Part 5 â€” Conclusions

In this final part, summarize and reflect on the results of your Fake News Detection project.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Points
- Discuss the performance differences between your *test set* and the *LIAR dataset*.  
- Use *visualizations* or *statistics* to highlight dataset discrepancies.  
- Reflect on *sample bias* and its impact when evaluating on data from a different distribution.  
- Share *insights and lessons learned* from the entire project.

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection
Consider:
- Were you surprised by differences in performance across datasets?  
- How can Fake News prediction models be improved â€” through *better algorithms* or *better data*?  
- What future steps could enhance real-world robustness and fairness?

End this part with a thoughtful summary of what the project taught you about the challenges of *machine learning on real-world text data*.
